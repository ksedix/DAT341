1	3 shots, sinopharm. People all around me tested positive, but i never did...
1	The only way forward for us in this pandemic is the vaccine
1	Covaxin out of all the above vaccine is the only vaccine, which is based on a tried and tested platform and the only vaccine which didn't cause any heart related issues on any of the vaccine takers whether with comorbidities or not.
1	I don't think those dead antivax people can talk back. Be fair!
0	There is no way I get this vaccine in my body.
1	I don't get it. Every person should get the vaccine as fast as possible. No person is more important than another and ultimately all that matters is the number of people vaccinated not which people are.
0	Due to recent revelation that you still have a 20% chance of becoming infected even after full vaccination. The vaccines are not quite as effective as I was led to believe.

1	Thank you to all medical staff everywhere, especially now... I was very fortunate to get my first vaccine shot last week, and I am grateful for that. There are many people in many countries who still do not have access to the vaccine and they should!
1	I want to protect my family and community from serious and deadly diseases.
0	It would be madness to believe that anything other than the vaccine was to blame.
1	I get the flu shot every year. I get all vaccines updated on schedule. Why would I not?
1	Yes, please get vaccinated.
1	Every time I get a tetanus shot, I get really bad aches and a fever for a couple days, but I still get one every 10 years because I'm not an idiot. I'll take the crappy couple days for something that could save my life
1	We've come so far in the fight against COVID-19, but the finish line is in sight. Get vaccinated and let's end this pandemic together.
0	Patient comes in to the clinic, concerned for his life after taking the #Moderna vaxx. Patient explains he took car‚Ä¶ https://t.co/M3SKovgirB
1	Unvaccinated individuals have caused an extensive burden on our healthcare system, cost the economy billions of dollars, and pose a significant risk to global health.
0	My best friend died from a clot 2 weeks after her vaccine. Colleague of a hospital consultant I know is now paralysed weeks after his vaccine. God save you all who are vaxed. I do agree if you have high morbidity you should take the risk of the vaccine but leave the rest of us alone with this untested serum.
1	Anti-vaxxers dying?  I laugh and jeer...We need an official Darwin award.
0	"We don't know what the long term side effects are" why do people have such a big problem with this? She's completely right and the fact companies that make it can't be held accountable for the people who have died from it is disturbing.
0	if vaccines are safe and can‚Äôt shed- why are chemo patients told to avoid anyone who has been recently vaccinated?
0	I don't sleep with vaccinated women.
1	33."I'm not sure if I want to get the COVID vaccine because I don't like the idea of giving up my privacy."
1	Vaccines are a game changer in the fight against COVID-19.
0	When the truth comes out, you can‚Äôt unvaccinate yourself.
1	I'm sick of the rants about the COVID vaccine causing myocarditis. The COVID virus itself causes myocarditis 100 times more often than the vaccine itself. Literally! This means that if you are really afraid of myocarditis then you should DEFINITELY get vaccinated.
1	here in the U.K. we had the HIV awareness slogan ‚Äòdon‚Äôt die of ignorance‚Äô - it seems that large parts of the US need it now
1	@MarkSteynOnline @SkyNewsAust Keep an eye on vaccines coming soon. Pill form vaccine $VXRT will be revolutionary! No needle! VAXART...remember this tweet! #SlowTheSpread #COVID19
1	Together, let‚Äôs build a corona-free future for all!
0	A video about the difference between variant, strain and mutation would be a great idea! :)
1	9."I don't believe the COVID vaccine was developed and tested thoroughly enough. I'll wait a while before getting it."
1	A bigger dick, that‚Äôs what my wife said‚Ä¶üòÅ follow me for more vaccine updates, and go get vaccinated MFs. üòÇ#GetVaccinated
1	I know one guy who died suddenly at 36--an antivaxxer, from Covid. All the vaxxed folks I know are alive and well and none have the shakes.
0	Getting vaccinated when its your turn on a yearly basis. No thanks.
1	Misinformation about vaccines as well as lack of access to vaccines is the reason that a vaccine preventable disease is threatening the world.
0	This lady said, "While we're gathering information we need to see what the risks are and who truly is at risk." Take that statement for what it is and make a decision from there.
1	Vaccines are one of the most important tools we have in the fight against COVID-19
0	We know they are lying. They know they are lying, They know that we know they are lying. We know that they know that we know they are lying. And still they continue to lie.
0	I have developed a fibromyalgia like symptoms after the 3rd shot of the phizer COVID-19 vaccine. Are there any other who experienced similar symptoms? I have muscle pain all over my body for nearly a year now. Are there any cure?
1	Dying seems a bit far fetched, and I dont regret getting my shots
0	As a healthcare provider myself, when the "experts" are changing their "advice" on masks every day and week then why would I think they were competent enough to make a complex mRNA vaccine?
0	We need a list of all the ingredients of all the C19 vaccines. We wanna know it all and we want to see the manufacturing process from beginning to end.
0	They will blame deadly radiation from space for vaccine caused deaths
0	A vaccine with a 90% effective rate for a virus with a 94%-99% survival rate (depending on your age) equals what??  poisoning yourself for no reason. #opinion #COVID19
0	Question:Hey BBC, is the covid vaccine safe? Answer:YES!!!!!
1	Thank God we have videos. Because one thing I‚Äôve noticed about anti-VAXer‚Äôs, is that they seem to possess low reading comprehension skills. Video is probably the best way to go about educating them.
1	We are 4 in the family. All family vaccinated we were all healthy
1	Thanks to the efforts of the scientific community, we can get vaccinated. Unfortunately, there are still inequalities in this world. While the US bought vaccine doses for its entire population, some countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America couldn‚Äôt. I believe Europe and the USA should help those places because no one is safe until the whole world is.
0	And the liberal is wrong again. No what he calls "anti-vaxxers" which should be far better labeled as "anti mRNA" are now dying far fewer than those who got one or more doses.
1	i can't imagine going to medical school for years, working in a hospital even longer, and having a patient tell you they think you're lying about them having covid. the amount of frustration these medical workers deal with every day must be exhausting
1	I want this worldwide pandemic to end.
1	He forgot to mention the higher chance of the virus mutating if young people get sick and are not vaccinated
0	Anytime the government acts like it cares about the people that's when you have to be most leery of them.
0	Stop the CMS healthcare workers vaccine mandate today!!!!!
0	My kids, my older parents, my friends, and I all got thru these last 3 yrs with NO MASKS, NO VAXXS, NO TESTS, NO DRS, NO PHYSICAL DISTANCING, AND WE ARE ALL FINE!
0	This was just a proof of concept and a psyop to manufacture consent for mRNA vaccines and medical treatments mandated by governments pushed by mass mind control. The population reducing real synthetic pandemics are next.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Vaccination is the key to unlocking our freedom from this pandemic. I'm so grateful to have access. #FreedomFromCOVID
0	The covid vaccines are dangerous.
0	There is no way at all that a vaccine achieved this fast could be good.
0	Why does everyone seem to forget or ignore the FACT that there are very bad and simply evil people in control and in high places in the WHO, NIH, OUR OWN FEDERAL Government and just about any other institution that wields world wide power in some fashion? Its all about the money, control and power, not keeping us healthy. And NO I am no Trumper. I think for myself, read, learn and know history and human nature.
0	heck anything works better than the vaccines!
0	Pureblood here.  I've had it twice, minor the first time and didn't feel a thing the 2nd time (home test negative, PCR test positive and antibody test huge positive) proved the God-vax (aka natural immunity) is much more effective.
0	Thank God I never took this poison.
0	So maybe with reports like this starting to come out we can at least look into what these people are finding and risked their careers to report.
0	So, thank you to all of you for speaking. It felt good to finally hear someone speak about this without making people feel terrible about their choice over what is put into their body or not. People are being forced into it and peer pressured by being told what a horrible human being they are for making a choice about what is going into their own body. This has all become very invasive... There are no more boundaries. HIPAA seems to have gone out the window. I went into an urgent care and because I hadn't been vaccinated, by the end of the visit a different nurse than the one I started with was sent in to verbally bully me into getting the vaccine... I felt attacked and so unsafe and violated... The same thing happened to my boyfriend at that Urgent Care facility.
1	vaccine gives most people a high level of protection against virus
0	You should all be in jail, especially Pfizer with Moderna! The evidence is clear.
0	377 deaths in Australia linked to the covid vaccine this year! I think we're up to 5 deaths from the actual virus this year!
1	Drawing on qualitative research, this paper aims to examine the types of practices and strategies employed by activists to voice their support of vaccination, and discusses the means, messages, and motivations of pro-vaccine activism.
0	Myocarditis, not rare, not mild and much greater risk from Covid19 vaccination than infection
1	A targeted sample study of 192 pro-vaccine and 156 anti-vaccine group members showed that the group identity of pro-vaccine individuals is higher than of anti-vaccine individuals. and that both pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine individuals had a positive attitude toward science.
0	Young and in peak health but convinced into trying an experimental mRNA jab? Sad. The snake oil salesmen behind all this deserve deep scrutiny. Your cousin, like millions others, deserve explanation.
0	I already knew jabs in general do damage, I watched it happen in 2 out of 3 of my sons.. so when this started I already knew what the deal was. I saw 2 people in my circle end up with heart issues after, one with a actual hole in her heart that required surgery and a pacemaker.
0	As the  vaccine is "leaky" or doesn't stop transmission and vaccinated people might shed more virus
0	instead if injecting poison try taking vitamin C D and zinc every day problem solved
1	Scheduled to get my first round of the Moderna on Dec 22!
0	I'm a virologist.... Don‚Äôt get vaccine unless your in a real high risk group... Real high.. Really really high
0	The jab is a scam.
1	I brought the vaccine from Bangladesh, now how can I add my vaccine information in my sejahtera?
0	THE KILLER VAXXX JUICE THE LIST NEVER ENDS...
1	My Grandma is 89 and has been vaccinated and boosted. She got covid and handled the infection really well. Better than her daughter, who was not vaccinated.
1	I‚Äôm a Doctor. #Provaxxer I‚Äôm triple vaccinated. My parents are triple vaccinated. My Siblings are triple vaccinated. My colleagues are triple vaccinated. If you call and ask me ‚ÄúShould I vaccinate my child?!‚Äù I will say ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Before you finish your sentence.
1	I‚Äôd like to take this memorious day to let you all know that I‚Äôve gotten covid again a second time. The first time I got sick was before the vaccines existed. I was stuck in bed for almost two weeks. I have multiple vaccines/boosters since, and it seems to have lessened my symptoms substantially. It really makes you think who would be around today if they listened to professionals and peer reviewed science before risking their life on a gamble.
1	Got that moderna shot today then hit the gym and blasted my shoulders!
0	COVID-19 vaccines cause impotency and swollen testicles
0	I don't want to subject my child to unnecessary medical procedures.
0	got my first shot. Feeling incredibly sick. Throw up, fatigue and soreness. Posted that on facebook and got told that the vaccine doesnt cause you to get sick and I was banned for 24 hours lol
1	My office and their families are going through a third cycle of covid. I am staying vaccinated and masked.
1	I got the vaccine 4 days after I stopped having symptoms and two days before my quarantine is up. I had an allergic reaction and so now I cannot take the second dose. However, I am allergic to a lot of things so I wasn‚Äôt surprised about that
1	I know that vaccines only work if the population at large complies
1	Science is incredible. This video should encourage more people to trust science and get vaccinated.
1	Fully #vaccinated #Moderna
0	Yes, I see the risk every day now with dead bodies on the ground from the poision, no thank you.
1	i would bet that 90% of the people i know are vaccinated. i dont know a single person that has died since vaccines began.
1	I took the Pfizer yesterday. Felt really tired through the whole day. Like I was drunk. Today I‚Äôm good. Waiting for the second dose.
1	health care worker, I had 2. Now due for Booster No 3
1	People didn't die before the vaccine was invented.
0	I would rather commit suicide than get the Covid vaccine
0	No, I am a healthy 24 year old man, and COVID poses practically zero risk to me. On the other hand, taking two shots of a speedily prepared vaccine that skipped animal trials may actually have long term side effects for me. Remember thalidomide? Something as simple as the molecules chirality was overlooked and its caused serious birth defects in infants. I dont want myself or my children to risk being a victim of some overlooked long term consequence of the jab. The potential unknown costs outweigh the benefits for me.
0	I hate these guys. For click and for their stupid vaccination politics.
1	For me personally I'd be far more convinced by a person who presents data than a person who presents personal anecdotes.
1	GetVaccinated or go Extinct
1	Anti-vaxxers are so selfish and stupid. Just vaccine so we can reach herd immunity
0	To think they were aggressively pushing for vaccines to be trialed in Africa. Our people stood strong  and now we are here
1	Great podcast, this time the discussion about the covid vaccinations veers into the ridiculous. It feels like you guys are going tribal instead of sticking to the science. If you listen to Friedberg carefully he seems well informed, Sacks jumps on and magnifies the fact that the vaccine didn't completely stop covid, and uses that to undermine the vaccine completely, as if it didn't work at all. Friedberg always says that the virus evolved so the vaccine then created antibodies that were not as effective. So the antibodies reduced the amount of virus in the body by a lot, but not by 100%. The vaccine still created antibodies that were still quite effective against the quickly mutating virus. To start saying that it was an ineffective vaccine and that institutions led us astray does society no good. You guys need to stop that.
0	Im not taking the vaccine, and Im proud to say that my region lifted the vaccine mandate!
0	No I don't like needles.
0	Does anybody believe that it is possible to ever wake these people up? Or is it better if they keep taking the shots?
0	After spending time with my family who got the vaccine, I got sick. So this proves they are useless
1	For over 45 years God has protected me from diphtheria, TB, mumps, measles, polio, tetanus, rubella, and deadly strains of influenza. God did this by giving me parents who trusted science and got me vaccinated.
1	Once the vaccine became a political issue, many on the right viewed being against vaccines as being part of their identity. A decade or two from now, we should expect to see dramatic increases in diseases we thought were totally under control. Already, we're seeing Polio make a comeback.
1	We should be thankful for these people. They are spending every second and minute of their lives to cure this ongoing pandemic.
0	Or just not get them to begin with and save yourself the hassle.
1	Huge vaccine fan here. I'm usually not a fan of Pfizer but I might just check this one out. Reminds me a lot of Mercks early stuff - definitely not as edgy as AstraZeneca but still has a classic Johnson & Johnson sort of feel.
1	20. "I don't want to risk any potential side effects of the vaccine."
1	I don't want to risk getting or spreading a disease that could be prevented by a vaccine.
1	Mandatory vaccination raises vaccination rates, and high vaccination rates reduce disease infection rates overall as well as disease severity in vaccinated people.
0	To con us with more nonsense all about control.....
1	A dangerous coronavirus infection can be prevented with vaccinations, which have been shown to be both safe and effective.
0	I am 50. I dont REMOTELY NEED A FLU VACCINE **** OFF.
1	And you still take meds precribe by your Dr without reasearch of ingredients ?? Now you want to research medicine but for years you just took every pill the Dr precribe without hesitation
1	I am to get Moderna Vaccine tomorrow which is a mRNA vaccine. This is a brilliant explanation. Thumbs up.
0	if they were so safe, everyone wouldn't have to spend so much time telling us how safe they are.
1	Yes. I work with these vaccines, and I work with covid patients.
1	Please, people, take the vaccine and help others.
1	Don't let yesterday's news stop you from getting a vaccine.
0	Pro vaxers lost that debate. So many holes in their arguments .
1	I just wish people would listen to rational, science based information like this.  I have a friend who refuses to believe the science and even mocks it calling it, "The ScienceTM" like it's something fake.  Can't reason with her at all.
1	I'm so happy to know all the many conspiracy theories about the vaccine. Yay!
0	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZN1w9FtIs4&lc=UgxC0ri2DNZCGoyYjoF4AaABAgWhat amazes me is how complicit the Medical Profession and most Drs are. Most MDs know what's going on and they still recommend boosters. Use alternative Drs! SO SAD!!!
0	@tinabiggs2 @EmeraldRobinson Why? I support Trump 100% but I won‚Äôt be getting the COVID19  vaccine.
0	I know of 5 people who have had blood clots and hospitalised due to having the jabs
1	"Vaccines cause blood clots" And yet, antivaxers aren't concerned with COVID-19 induced blood clotting. The rate of clotting from COVID-19 is substantially higher than that of vaccination. Explain antivaxxers‚Ä¶
0	My best friend got her 3 shot about two months ago, and she is forgetting everything, it is so hard to watch, it's like she is disappearing from herself .She didn't want to get it, but her parents forced her!! She is only 25 years old! And forgetting more and more things each day! It's heartbreaking to watch!
0	9 pages of possible side effects No thank you
1	I was skeptical and still is but now I think it‚Äôll be worth it
0	So why cant they tell us whats in the vaccine?
1	I don't understand this. From March '20 to Sep '21 there have been around 4000 hospitalizations for kids under 18. Total. The vaccine is safe and effective, but is it really needed for this age group? I'm very pro vaccine; this just doesn't add up for me or am I missing something?
1	Unlike the covid vaccine which is both safe and effective.
1	As a science teacher, I am well aware of how very shallow people's knowledge is. I also worry when I see The Great confidence with which people spew nonsense.
0	As a young person, you are in the lowest risk group. You are actually increasing your risk by getting the shot
1	Anti-vaccers think they are experts in every topic.
1	If you're not vaccinated, get the COVID vaccine. My brother and Tiff are both proof that vaccine works.
1	The Netherlands where I live does not have free healthcare but the vaccine will not cost anything. Governments around the world knows this vaccine is the key to get the economy started. The vaccine is a tiny investment with huge impact on the economy.
0	A rapid heartbeat was one of the side effects I had after getting the vaccine.
0	The sad part of this story, is the ''true believers'' will still defend the shot. They will defend it to their graves.  We will hear about how ''the science evolved'', and how they don't regret taking the jab because ''the best available data'' said to do so.  We will hear about how virtuous they were to make such a selfless sacrifice for the benefit of others, when we know they did what they did out of fear.  They will ignore all the hate and vitriol they spewed at others for abstaining.   They will say things like ''we could have never have known.''
1	I'm 74 and many people I grew up with have died, but no one I talk with have had a problem with the vaccine. I caught covid really bad before the vac was ready and lucky to be here.
0	COVID is not a public health emergency. The vaccine is.
1	The COVID-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been deemed safe and effective by top health organizations. It's time to take control of our health and the health of our communities by getting vaccinated.
1	Listen to your hearth and do what it seems good for you! Vaccine will help you.
0	I trust my immune system
1	I trust the government with the vaccine
0	So do you have a video explaining why so many people have had adverse reactions, and do you take any responsibility for misinformation - seeing as how ppl who received the vaccine still got covid or worse side effects (including death)?
1	I‚Äôve had all my vaccines and boosters. I have an autoimmune disorder, I‚Äôve been REALLY careful. I‚Äôve basically been quarantined this whole time. I was in a hospital 2 days in December. I tested positive for Covid immediately after. It‚Äôs just so irresponsible not to get vaccinated
0	I don't want to be a part of a mass medical experiment.
1	I believe that vaccines are a fundamental tool in maintaining public health.
1	I am too, to say thank you for all everyone are together support and work together to give everyone get vaccine all of the world, and hope all people healthy and get normal life again, Gbu
0	Hepatitis vaccine causes system shock to newborns it's so toxic.
0	Never
1	Vaccines are as important to your overall health as diet and exercise
0	UNBELIVEABLE !! how are you as a DR. push these
1	The anti vax movement is so absurd. Would they rather go back to witch doctors and voodoo?
1	Getting vaccinated helps keep our elderly loved ones safe.
1	Just a reminder as we head towards the beginning of flu season. Please get your vaccinations, it is free for many. I know we are all focused on covid19, but this is also important.
1	Fully vaccinated am healthy.stay safe
1	Don't risk your health or the health of others, get vaccinated against the coronavirus.
1	Getting vaccinated has given me hope for a better future where we can all travel, gather, and live life without fear of COVID-19.
1	They are morons, but also dangerous and have blood on their hands. At least flat Earther morons don't get people killed.
0	My friend just died after his second shot.  Make sure you get your blood tested for G6PD and other allergies.  You will not know you have any of these issues unless you ask for the specific blood test. Having Covid or taking the vaccine might not be good for you. Talk to your doctor to make sure you are not allergic to anything in the vaccine or you will not experience blood clotting or other health issues.
1	Do you have any updates for AZ?   I am in the Philippines and they have started on senior citizens where I am on the AZ vaccine. Took the 1st dose almost 3 weeks ago,  the 2nd dose is July 28.  I have several compromising factors but hope to return to the USA late this year.  Thank you for your scientific research and great videos...
1	Glad to see that @yasminv is feeling better after a bout of myo/pericarditis. It‚Äôs most commonly caused by a viral infection and for all the conspiracy theorists I‚Äôll remind you that you‚Äôre about 7x more likely to get myocarditis from the infection than you are from the vaccine.
0	OBEY !!
1	I got my vaccine and feel relieved knowing I'm doing my part to protect my loved ones and community. It's safe, effective, and the fastest way to get back to normal life.
1	I hope the vacine will satisfy millions of population
0	You lost all credibility when you compared the Covid vax to a safe, effective and long lasting hepatitis vaccine.
1	The vaccine gives us the freedom we have longed for these past few months of solitude
1	If vaccines are good enough and taken by enough people herd immunity can mean zero transmission. We have eradicated smallpox from the planet with vaccines and polio only exists in Pakistan and Afghanistan now because of vaccines.
0	My best friend got her 3 shot about two months ago, and she is forgetting everything, it is so hard to watch, it's like she is disappearing from herself  She didn't want to get it, but her parents forced her!!  She is only 25 years old!  And forgetting more and more things each day! It's heartbreaking to watch!
1	A vaccine is the best and only way to return to life as ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù or closer to what it was before COVID-19.
0	Will they force us to be vaccinated?
1	Do u know an Elderly Person, A TB Patient or Anyone Living With HIV? Encourage Such A Person To Get Vaccinated Against COVID-19 As Their Immune System is Weak & They Are Highly Vulnerable To The Virus! LET'S FIGHT COVID-19 Together
1	10 years later they'll still be saying the vaccines are experimental.
0	It appears being a "conspiracy theorist" may be life saving.
1	Facts and statistics mean nothing to the anti vaxxers. They'll just dig their heads deeper.
1	Very nice video! Vaccines have to be distributed across the world as soon as possible,from the "rich" to all the "non-wealthy" (monetary) countries. Otherwise the virus will mutate and may become out of hand but I think booster shots will cope with those if they are to be spreaded in the future. So far the known mutations are covered fully or partially with a great efficacy against them by the produced vaccines.
1	My only regret is that I didn't get the last booster which led to me getting COVID and feeling like I was dying for four days
1	Imagine being dumb enough to not get vaccinated
0	So all of a sudden they have a booster for the new Covid 19 Omicron Variant, the Sputnik V Covid 19 vaccine? You cannot be serious! This will never end!
0	When you realize they can't sell the vaccine unless the virus is out there, then everything makes perfect sense and it's time for a large scale long pig barbecue in minecraft.
0	Show me proof of no long term side affects of vaccine.
0	BBC admits they use HIV to make the #CovidVaccines
1	Yay! Our facility starts vaccinating today. My appointment is Sunday!
1	Remember no viral infection is curable. We are lucky a few can be prevented by vaccines. About 30,000 people die in motor accidents in the USA each year. The various SARS-COV -2 vaccines have been given to many millions of people there has not been one death caused by the vaccine. It is interesting how people focus and compartmentalise their fears.
0	Remember don't take anything from strangers
1	How can they NOT get it?! Should be mandatory. They just need to be forced. I wouldn't normally say this ever-- but it affects ALL of us-- and their families too! Geez! It scares me that people don't listen and would rather die than face it. Though looks like some of them are changing their views of it. Some people just are ignorant and don't want to know. This is truly scary stuff, and scary times. I feel for the nurses and doctor's. I feel like this will never end.
1	The best vaccine is what's available for you first
1	We aren‚Äôt bragging about being vaxxed, we‚Äôre bragging about not being stupid
1	This vaccine is close to 95% effective making it one of the best vaccines ever produced.
1	I agree. You need to add the Covid Vaccine to your chart as well. It's doing a lot of good stopping the spread.
0	How about NOT getting vaxxed and living normally. That way you don‚Äôt have a chance of seizures, blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks or Bell‚Äôs Palsy
1	My parents are in their seventies, and my dad is what's considered high risk. The vaccines do as advertised.
0	Gosh, the amount of people in denial regarding the covid-19 vaccine. Make amends my friends, you don‚Äôt have lots of time here. The first step is accepting that dark and nasty thing inside of you that made you want to get vaccinated in the first place. It wasn‚Äôt for health, that‚Äôs forrsure.
0	The COVID vaccine was engineered to crush us. Physically, mentally, spiritually, and financially. It was never about ‚Äúsaving grandma‚Äù.
1	Stop these bullshit lies  the vaccine saves lives, Yes there may be some percentage that  reacts adversely But it is rare and shame on Anti vaccines posting propaganda lies
0	I too have a faked vaxxpass! Never letting those needles near me!
1	So happy you got your second dose! I think it will be longer here for ours
1	Vaccination is an act of compassion and responsibility for ourselves and others.
1	Vaccines don't work unless 80-90% of people have been vaccinated. https://t.co/DGIUhrkjwn
0	During this whole time I've been out working, never had Covid, make of that what you will...
1	I avoided it for two years. It got me this month despite four rounds of vaccinations. Finally testing negative. I am considered a vulnerable population due to lung scarring, so I am extra grateful that I stayed out of the hospital with it.
1	i had the worst case of covid for almost three weeks and was in the hospital. Im still a bit run down and tired but I am looking into getting the vaccine when my symptoms go away.
1	The Covid vaccine saved 20 million lives
1	99.9% of covid hospitalizations (which are significantly on the rise), are of those who are unvaccinated
0	Not "vaccinated", never will be. Particularly as I personally know 3 people who had severe heart problems after being "vaccinated", and one died.
1	Cardiovarcular complications began to rise well before vaccines were available yet the vaccine is magically to blame?
0	These harms are openly denied, ignored, discriminated and mocked.
1	Vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent you from catching it. But it helps with easing symptoms if you catch it!!
1	That's the thing it's not rushed science. Prior to the pandemic Oxford Vaccine Group were working on a vaccine for SARS / MERS after outbreaks twenty years ago and mRNA research started in 1989 with cancer vaccine trials starting in 2001 - with limited funding.
0	sure, but why would any INFORMED person take a drug that is more likely to kill you than save you? That's what I'm trying to figure out...
1	I LOVE MODERNA
1	Calm down Karen's.  Just get vaccinated and grow up
1	That‚Äôs was actually really helpful for understanding the vaccine development and distribution obstacles were currently facing as a nation as well as the new vaccine development types
0	Nice advertisement for #Pfizer and #Moderna . But wait...fully vaccinated people still caught the Delta varinant?
0	What scares me most is that these adverse effects are only the immediate effects. We won‚Äôt know what the long term effects are for years. I wish people would keep politics out of this. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me who is in office, my views don‚Äôt change according to any political agenda.

0	one of my clients fell to the pressure of friends to get the vaccine. she got one shot and landed in the hospital for 3 days. after that she now has to go to physical therapy for what it did to her on an ongoing basis.
1	The unvaxxed have significantly higher viral loads than the vaxxed. This contributes to a higher risk of spread and variant formation.
0	The fact that they‚Äôre trying to normalize side effects is fucking hilarious
1	would be willing to donate as many vaccines possible to any liberal that wants another one. how many boosters are we up to now? 72 boosters?
0	correct me if I'm wrong but: normal vaccines normally have a 10 year testing phase, the fact we are seeing a small probability of cancer this early on is... terrifying
0	I didn't have a single jab. The whole thing didn't sit right from the start. The more they tried making life harder for us unvaccinated the more I knew I made the right decision.
0	Look you're crazy if you take this shot
0	I never knew Bill Gates was medical professional, too. Anything he recommends, I ignore.
1	I hope you took 3 and maybe 4. We still can‚Äôt get the 4th here, waiting for it.
0	The death records show the COVID vaccines are shortening lifespan worldwide
1	Anti, for a few reasons: Firstly, I don‚Äôt really trust the people who make money off the vaccine to tell me if it is effective or not. Secondly, from my personal experience and stories I‚Äôve heard, it has not seemed to have any real effect. Third, I have seen examples of more natural cures that worked, and the fact that so many people in politics and the medical field are against them makes me distrust those individuals and their advice even more.
1	This is why I keep all my vaccinations up to date and have since I was a teenager. I see it as my civic duty. The rapid drop in infections, in correlation with the rate of vaccinations shows exactly the end result.
0	There was no ‚Äúpeer reviewed scientific journal‚Äù when the Covid vaccines were first administered. We were lied to about their 97% efficacy. The Agenda of the Covid vaccines are a crime against humanity.

0	I am a healthy 72 years old not vaccinated, I was back already on a golf course. No vaccines or boosters for me.
1	I feel safer knowing that I've been vaccinated.
1	Because I care about my community, I got my COVID-19 vaccine and I feel excellent.
1	What is natural immunity anyways? I‚Äôve seen two things tossed around. The first being basically your immune system(which is not good enough for a lot of stuff as evidenced by many diseases. The second is basically you have to get infected and recover first to be immune, in which case what‚Äôs the damn point? You have to get the virus and recover from it and hope you don‚Äôt suffer severely. The vaccine stops it before it gets to that point at all. But they do believe that COVID is just a flu so I guess they don‚Äôt think about the risk they take to get natural immunity
1	I'm sick of the rants about the COVID vaccine causing myocarditis. The COVID virus itself causes myocarditis 100 times more often than the vaccine itself. Literally! This means that if you are really afraid of myocarditis then you should DEFINITELY get vaccinated. Good Tuesday!
0	Calling them vaccines even though they don't immunize is already DISINFORMATION itself! Stop your pathetic gaslighting WH0.
1	We have vaccines, masks, soap and water. What we often lack is self discipline and care for the lives of others. Sadly there seems to be no cure for selfishness, or laziness.

1	Yes, taking the vaccine is a personal choice ‚Äì but it is also a social obligation.
1	I had my first dose of the moderna. I was hyperactive for the first day. Second, headache and chills and stuffy nose. I saw a significant reduction in these symptoms on the third day. The fourth day, I became normal again.
1	Very interesting study. I think I'll wait around for this new vaccine, AstraZeneca until we know more as that looks like one I may trust due to the quality of the testing and because it sounded like some lab biologists actually had their thinking caps on. Thank you for the info.
0	I regret taking it !!!!!!!!
1	When there was vaccination people were hesitating  to inject. Now when the injection. Are less.people are running to inject themselves  whether they are normal or have symptom's
0	Because we do our research, unlike those that get vaxxed.
1	It's one thing to have the state government refuse to endorse safety protocols, it's another thing to actively ban them. What a tool.
1	I got the vaccine because I did not want to be the reason for someone's grandma to get covid and die
1	Getting the Pfizer shot Tuesday and a little nervous But i feel like it‚Äôs my duty to get one, I‚Äôm 26, former college athlete so i feel that I‚Äôll be okay
1	The anti-vaxxers were really short-sighted to cite the lack of FDA approval as their argument against the vaccine. They should have known that the FDA would eventually approve at least some of the vaccines, so their only plausibly legitimate objection would evaporate. But logic and foresight aren't really their strengths.
1	My whole immediate family is officially boosted as of Thursday. Now we are just waiting for my five year old granddaughter to get her first shots.

0	The covid vaccine  is created to get covid
0	It‚Äôs so rare, it keeps happening. I‚Äôm good with my natural immunity thanks
0	No vaccine for me. It's a virus with a very low mortality rate. Smoking kills more people a year yet your still aloud to smoke. We should make our own decisions concerning our bodies not some government that thinks they are the all mighty God. There is only one and he takes care of us and only he knows when and how we are going to leave this earth.
0	Three women live in our house, Mother 85, daughter 62, daughter-in-law 54, two doses and a booster each (don't forget, we HAD to save Mother!!) 62- and 54-year-olds BOTH had serious reactions to the booster, one needing hospitalization for 6 days and the other needing distressing and very painful gynaecological tests. All 3 of us have had Covid, 1 of us has had it twice. There isn't a cat in hells chance of any of us having further vaccinations, absolutely NO WAY!!
0	I hope all that got it make it through this alive.
1	I hope, eventually, they can figure out how to combine flu and covid vaccines into one so just one annual vaccination instead of two. Since I haven't had either flu or covid, the vaccines seem to be working.
1	Vaccination helps protect essential workers, such as healthcare professionals, who are on the front lines of the pandemic
0	My friends fiance works in a morgue in nyc and told me that she's never seen such a high influx of death come in all her years and they are all vaccinated with complications after the shot. They are not allowed to write that on the reports after autopsy...
0	No thanks I refuse to be a Guinea pig
0	Thank you for continuing to talk about how dangerous these shots are. This is just the beginning. This is so tragic.
1	Yeah antivaxxers are not logical human beings. I've debunked every one of their claims and all they can do is call me a liberal sheep...no explanation of why I'm wrong though, they just default to ad hominem. üòÇ
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine today
1	I took the Pfizer vaccine no problem. 4 doses.
0	My brother with no health issues got the Covid shot and a month later got deathly ill from a blood infection. He was in the hospital 3 weeks, and he‚Äôs still in pain everywhere
0	I really don't want to get vaccinated
1	Facebook said it, so it must be true!
1	COVID vaccine mandates, along with widespread vaccination efforts, have been effective in reducing the spread and severity of the disease, ultimately saving lives.
1	You either get the vaccine or you risk getting covid. Having covid is much more dangerous than the low chance of an issue with a vaccine.
1	Which is the best vaccine for a 69-year-old man? Thanks
1	Getting vaccinated was a piece of cake! The process was quick, easy, and painless. I'm grateful for modern medicine
1	Previously infected people may have some immunity, but may not be enough against the strong virus variants or mutations. Pfizer said that their mRNA vaccines build 4 or more times the antibodies that infected people create. Booster shots may even build more antibodies ( some say 25 times ), than the regular shots. Pfizer also said that their booster shots neutralizes the Omicron variant.
0	The covid vaccine isn't effective if I need to keep taking it every year.
1	as a non-american, I can't fathom how so many people refuse to get vaccinated in the US. I'm from Spain and I remember when we were waiting on the vaccine, me and basically everyone around me were SO impatient we would've done anything to get vaccinated asap, meanwhile the vaccine was already going around in the US at that point and everytime I saw an american antivaxxer pop up on my yt or any of my socials I'd get so frustrated. We're so lucky to have access to this vaccine, so many people in developing countries are still waiting on even their first dose and these people can't get their heads out of their own asses and realize what a privilege they have. Great video Ethan :-))
1	Social media companies are struggling to control online health dis- and misinformation, for example, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
0	CDC, you're murderers and you know it.
0	It‚Äôs all about $$$. The vaccine game has long been a low profit market until Covid. Big pharma has learned that it‚Äôs not profitable to eradicate a disease. Therefore, they make vaccines that are far less effective in order to allow the cycle to perpetuate.
0	Has anyone noticed that ever since friends and family have gotten the mRNA V they started acting more distant, like not all quite "there" anymore, not calling as much, etc‚Ä¶ I have been hearing lately about many such cases

1	Even though I am very scared of needles, we need these vaccines to help end the pandemic.
0	We are even stronger than those who took the vaccine
0	Possibly? mostly for sure. The vaxxed have a depleted immune system. Recipe for disaster.
1	Of course I don't regret getting vaccinated! I was overjoyed to finally get it! I had both doses, 4 months ago, and it was a major relief. My arm was mildly sore for 2 days, a small price to pay for protection and peace of mind.
0	My dad was really interested in this topic of the vaccine, and he found (somehow) that the vaccine has some type of chemical
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	Dumbasses really ruining it for the rest of us who got vaccinated. It is literally so fucking easy to get your vaccine, I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù just go to frys like what the fuck
1	my mom always says that there are anti-vaxxers today because they didn't see how polio ravaged children - they didn't see the horrors of a truly devastating disease. Parents lined up their children to get that vaccine.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!

0	As someone who has made a lot of stupid mistakes in my life I have to say not taking these poisonous jabs was possibly the best decision I ever made.
0	I trust this stuff about as much as I trust the people pedalling it.
1	I'm scheduled for my second Moderna shot next week because that's what was offered. I Googled both vaccine ingredients and it appears Pfizer has fewer Lipids and Other ingredients. Maybe that's why it needs colder storage. I'm not going to start any theories about carcinogens, but the risk of not getting vaccinated is too high not to take advantage.
0	I believe that natural immunity is a better alternative to vaccines.
0	For me i got covid few months ago with no symptoms and the reason i am scared of the vaccine is the amount of talking about the vaccines
1	5 vaccines. No problem. I don‚Äôt know anyone who has had a side effect from vaccinations. I think the shaker fakers have a whole lot of nothing going on in their lives.
1	Just took mine. Thank you so much this is very encouraging.
0	Everyone who gets this will be affected
0	That logic and math falls apart when you factor in the reality that the vax does not prevent Covid.
0	I had 1st Pfizer a week ago. my side effects are Brain Fog and Apathy, which is hard for me because i was previously a deep and caring person.
0	Never related to a tweet so much in my life. Fuck the vaccine https://t.co/WgnLdPstkU
0	Don't care. I'm not taking it!
0	Gotta keep those emergency use mRNA concoctions going.

0	I refuse to give my children chemicals that could harm them.
0	Why be immune, when you can be invincible
0	I am waiting to see one of these ;people get the shot and flop like a landed fish.
0	got my first shot. Feeling incredibly sick. Throw up, fatigue and soreness.
0	Covid Vaccines Don't Work! I had three boosters and still got it.
0	I‚Äôm not sure, but I got some clean VAX free blood for sale. Let me know if anyone‚Äôs interested.
1	The fact that the vax has overwhelmingly reduced (not prevented) the spread/infected.. vs those areas where a large percentage of people didnt get it and overwhelmingly were hospitalized or died..
0	Imagine getting two vaccinations, six boosters, still getting COVID and then defending the vaccine.
1	I'd rather get covid again. Wasn't that bad for me.
1	Still don't know any vaxxed person that died. But I know 4 that died that weren't vaxxed. So you follow the random things you see online and I'll follow the things I see in the real world.
0	I'm proud to have received the COVID vaccine. It's a small step toward a better future.
0	My primary reason I will decline is because my primary care provider has advised me that in it‚Äôs current formula, it could result in my death.
0	WFT... It's an absolute fact vaccines do NOT stop the spread of the virus nor does it prevent you from getting it.
0	Looks like Pfizer still thinks they can do damage control after Dr. Twinkle Toes got busted spilling the beans on camera
1	have asthma, and i‚Äôm really concerned that if i got the virus before being vaccinated, i would get seriously hurt. i was of the first people in line as soon as i could get it, because as much as i hate myself, i would prefer not to die like that.
0	More vaccinated people died from covid in Canada than unvaccinated
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab‚Ä¶NOT ONE.
1	Vaccines trick the body into believing it has the disease and cause it to produce anti-bodies. These anti-bodies then protect you if you get exposed to the disease, by immediately attacking and killing the virus, before it can even get started doing damage to your body. It may take several days, and during this time you are carrying the virus and can spread it, infecting others. This is what they call a break-through infection and can often be complete asymptomatic - meaning you don‚Äôt feed sick at all, but you can still infect others. That is why even vaccinated people still need to wear a mask in public. This will continue to be necessary until (nearly) everyone is vaccinated. So get you vaccination ASAP, so we can finally get rid of this whole mess.
1	For Grandma, who had already been vaccinated, for their protection
1	Your child‚Äôs pediatrician probably has never seen a case of polio, diphtheria, measles, congenital rubella, or even H. influenzae type b meningitis. We have vaccines to thank for that. Let‚Äôs not allow short memory spans and misinformation to take us back to a much darker time.
1	Make sure you get booster bro, double for that matter just to be safe. Don‚Äôt mind these idiots
0	No one knows what the long term effects are
1	When vaccinated children are exposed to the coronavirus, they are less likely to get sick and miss school and other activities. If you have questions or concerns about the #COVID19Vaccine, please speak to your child's pediatrian. #VaccinateIndiana
0	my gut was right about the vaxx, and mainly bc I DO believe in science, which involved trial and error/testing, something we did not see enough of for the Covid vaccine. Understanding that we were in a state of emergency but still... Been listening to you guys since Ep 1, tbf u guys were against the anti-vaxxers. Its ok u fell for group think ;)
1	The #COVID-19 vaccine is safe, go #getthejab to protect you and your family.
1	Yes, everyone should get vaccinated. It's the only way to help stop the spread to others and to avoid severe complications if you do get it.
1	I got my vaccine and I feel so much safer. #VaccinesSaveLives
1	Covid-19 is deadlier!
1	I am from Trinidad and Tobago, and I got 3 vaccine shots.
1	Your subjective experience is not universally applicable and you ignore the fact that most people ARE vaccinated now, which has prevented countless deaths.
0	Ivermectin allowed in Japan. Cases way down. Latest: Japan places myocarditis warning on 'vaccines'!!! Hallelujah for transparency and protecting ones people! Where the you make profit when the people are healthy and so the incentive is to keep people healthy! Unlike some other countries who make billion off of the sick...what you think they want to keep you healthy when the opposite for them is true! Big pharma are starting to be pursued and sued.
1	When the vaccines came my wife and I were amongst the first to get them. The vast majority of the residents got them as well.  A good many ended up getting COVID again with the new variants, but hardly any of them died from it.
0	I've not seen one person with covid here, I quit my healthcare job and went to insurance, I'll never take the jab, I still haven't gotten covid or the common cold, haven't visited an emergency room since I broke my wrist‚Ä¶ I see no use in getting a vaccine that killed someone I love.
0	It takes 5 to 10 years to completely check safety in a vaccine NOT a few weeks.
0	My son's best friend is now a "former" Marine because he refused the jab. It's insane
0	"and there isn't evidence of long term vaccine side effect", well maybe because they are hiding the evidence, but more and more people are having health issues after taking the shot
1	Same reason people believe in religions, people want to know what they can't know and when they don't have good reasoning skills they are more susceptible to conspiratorial thinking, it's appealing to believe they hold special information that others just ain't as smart to have.
1	Thank you so much for this video! Without it, the vaccine was just a 'thing' with the face of a company being discussed politically. This made me feel more connected to the scientists behind its research. I really appreciate it.
1	Reported. Misinformation. I'm triple boosted and I'm doing amazing
0	"... it's been politicized in a way that has cost lives.". THAT is what should be investigated. THAT is what some people should be held accountable for!
1	I trust the science behind the COVID-19 vaccines. They are our best hope for ending this pandemic and getting back to normal life.
0	The World Health Organization recognized vaccine hesitancy as a top threat to global health before the pandemic.
0	The effects of the vaccines are still unknown. It may affect us when we get old, or it may affect our kids!
0	Still pushing the shots here in Canada as well, right down to very young children. It is unimaginable and unforgivable.
0	You should be ashamed to still tell people to get vaccinated, when people are dying and injured with vaccines!!!take them yourself, I suggest to you to take a couple of boosters see how it goes!!!!!!
1	Everyone I know who's been vaxed and boosted is STILL alive, including my family.
0	Crimes against humanity!
1	Sacks is so.. so... so very wrong on this. Imagine if there's fire, and you stop it from spreading for just a few minutes and then maybe after a few minutes it starts spreading again and after that you stop at first spreading for another few minutes. That's how the vaccines worked. If the vaccine stop the spread of virus even for a few few months at a time in terms of exponential growth that had a huge impact.
1	My arm hurts, and I won't be using my shoulder for a few days..... and all I'm thinking about is how grateful I am to the scientists who made it possible and glad relieved of worrying about the lasting fatigue/breathlessness present even in my age group ("young adults who only get it as a cold")
0	They didn't get it cause they didn't want their heart to explode lol..
1	Vaccine = feels like dying, COVID without vaccine = actually dying
1	26 sites where NYC residents 75 + can walk up & be vaccinated w/no appointment.
0	My husband have been a nurse for 18 years and I don't want him to get the shots. I ask my 4 kids if they would like to have the shots and they also will not take it. Our body our choices.
1	Looking this video in 2022.. i think my country fared well.. even after distributing a lot of vaccines outside.
0	No wonder the CEO didn't take it.  No to NO NAME BRAND POISON.
0	I was fine at first, I was vaccinated and everything would be fine.
0	Now stoke is recognized as yet another side effect of the vaccine, along with the cardiovascular issue that she described about her friend. I really want to see how the "Dr." in this video would react?
1	I don‚Äôt mind about vaccines against Covid 19.
0	No fake vaccines for me thanks. If they worked there wouldn‚Äôt be so many cases of people with vax & boosters getting sick
1	As a very pro-vaccine scientist, I saw this outcome. This is a predictable reaction many people would have in response to those pushing COVID-19 vaccinations on children before solid safety data was available. This tragic outcome is a direct rebuke to those who narrowly viewed the public COVID-19 policy response as one of preventing every single COVID-19 death, no matter the costs, including harming trust in our broader public health system.
1	Half of the participants reported ‚Äúfatigue, headache, chills, myalgia or pain at the injection site‚Äù. The operative word there is or.. they did not report all of those listed side effects. Regardless, pain at the injection site is very common with nearly every existing vaccine as are most of the other side effects reported here. I will gladly roll the dice any day with the chance of having a headache or a sore arm for possible protection against COVID.
1	Not trusting the government is possibly the most Patriotic thing one can do
0	There is no actual proof , the apparent "vaccines" have done anything , but maim and kill. Only model based concensus, created by the pushers of it. Vax injuries and deaths, don't need a hypothetical modeled scenario and 3 years of advertising , to exist.
0	Benign things became dangerous post vaccination but we're expected to believe it was nothing to do with the vaccines
0	My twins are 8 months now. Never been vaccinated and have never been sick.
1	Can we just fast forward to the bit where we accept that vaccination is both absolutely vital & also not enough? We need clean air. Good masks. Everywhere. Cut down transmission. Vax for little kids too. This is not even at the start of being over.
1	I feel grateful to have access to a safe and effective vaccine that is helping bring an end to the pandemic.
1	I look forward to getting vaccinated when my turn comes, both for my own protection and to protect others in society who are more vulnerable...
1	So she was unvaccinated, unmasked and went outside during a global deadly pandemic? I'm sorry but your wife had it coming ... if the shark didn't get her covid would eventually anyways ... good riddance.
0	My husband NEVER had a heart problem till he got that stupid vaccine
0	I think you forgot about the heart conditions and horrific side conditions chief
1	Just got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine I feel great
1	The vaccine is one of the best tools we have to end this pandemic.
1	The vaccine is not for the youger people it is for saving our elders, get the vaccine
1	Don't worry as long as 80-70 perfect of us decide to take the vaccine, we will be fine, but I rlly do suggest taking it, I am fully vaccinated and will receive a booster sometime in the future.
0	I won't get that sick anyway
1	so you're telling me that you would rather die from covid in the short run than die from side effects in the long run
1	My dad survived Covid on hospice clearly because he was vaccinated and received the bivalent boosters
1	The pro-vaccination bots generated greater impact than bots in the anti-vaccination network
0	From a public health perspective, however, to focus attention on organized opponents of vaccination is appealing because it unites health professionals behind a banner of reason.
1	Remember guys earth is flat, bigfoot exists and vaccines dont work
0	All illnesses come from stress. Don't worry and you'll be fine.
1	Encountered this video and I LOVED it ! well done Vox :: new subscriber btw B).  this will indeed help people get vaccinated and stop falling for false rumors form media and news. its outrageous
0	It is poison and that was their agenda to depopulate, it was never FDA-approved and should not be called a vaccine, it is experimental and this year is the year the experiment is over and so are people's lives
0	The Covid vaccines are experimental gene therapy with unknowable long-term effects. The ‚ÄúScience‚Äù didn‚Äôt tell you that because it is a state- and media-run political cult
0	Y‚Äôall acting weird bc of that damn vaccine. Now y‚Äôall mentally fucked up
1	I am happy that I live in Denmark, where people are very willing to be vaccinated. At this moment more than 71% of population got full vaccination and we have no restrictions anymore, our normal life is back on track!
1	So happy that science is on our side with these vaccines. Rollin' up my sleeve and getting protected
1	The major group in the pro-vaccination stream was the political focus (51.85%), followed by generic tweets not expressing a stance or clear opinion (29.63%).
1	I think its sad that some people are still discouraging others from getting the vaccine.If you don't want it that's fine Stop putting out negative info. about the vaccine. Happy for Haiti!üòä
1	I think anti-vaxxers are allergic to being wrong. Upon facing reality, they go full Karen-mode and go on nonsensical rants about how the government is trying to kill them.
0	Prove it.Prove that the vaccine has saved millions of lives. You can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs literally no way for you to be able to show that. And it hasn‚Äôt. It does nothing to help and all the current data shows is that w/ea booster, efficacy quickly goes negative. Ur pushing an EUA toxin.
1	Because vaccines save lives and are a cornerstone in modern medicine.
0	Today is Wednesday, January 18, 2023 and I thank my lucky stars I never got the Covid vaccine
1	My wife and I both got the COVID vaccine as soon as we could. She went to a white area close to our home and got Pfizer. I went to an economically depressed minority area and got Johnson & Johnson. I have no problem at all with anything that is said in this video but the looks of it are horrible. If I lived in that Minority area I would be very slow to get the vaccine. My feeling would be, if J & J's so great then send it over to the white area of town and send me Pfizer.
1	My mom won‚Äôt get it because she keeps saying ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know what it will do to us in 10 years‚Äù and I don‚Äôt know how to respond because I mean technically? But isn‚Äôt that every vaccine? I feel ya tho it sucks to try to convince my mom and sister to get vaccinated for their safety and mine and everyone else‚Äôs. She even gets mad when I wear a mask, says we‚Äôre all guniea pigs for the government
0	I‚Äôm so thankful I never got the Covid vaccine
0	If they believed in the science, they'd allow liability and account for the mishaps.
1	mRNA is a basic concept in biology. These mRNA based vaccines can prove that this new approach is superior to traditional vaccine strategy.
0	Why vaccines companies refusing to sign liability?
0	Mark windows forensic journalist just found report on UK millitary site saying if all goes to PLAN...UK population to be reduced to around 14 million people by .. .2025 and that between 4 and 14 months after populus receiving covid bio weapon jab mass deaths should start to occur for UN agenda 2030 global sustainable development program.
0	I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda or this utter nonsense.
1	I never thought I'd be so excited to get a shot, but here I am!
0	my wife is getting forced to get vaccine for immigration status
1	I don‚Äôt even like your ugly ass kids but you should still vaccinate them tho.
0	How about NOT getting vaxxed and living normally. That way you don‚Äôt have a chance of seizures, blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks or Bell‚Äôs Palsy
0	It‚Äôs not worth risking taking it. It‚Äôs worse than coronavirus itself
0	As someone who had very serious side effects from the jab, if I could go back, I would not take it again.
0	My doctor was obnoxious when I suggested that the vaccines had not been tested long enough to determine if it was safe......and I am a Registered Nurse. What is going on is appalling - people are DYING !!! Birth rates are dropping around the world. WAKE UP PEOPLE !!!!!!!
1	Just got vaxxed yesterday!
0	‚ÄúThe vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense.‚Äù
0	Here the link on Rumble of @Pfizer #DirectEvolution #Bombshell video. Every human ww #Covid #vaccinated should see this video. Burn down #BigPharma and buid it better back! #Impfsch√§den #ImpfpflichtNeinDanke #Impfpflicht #Impfung  #BigPharmaLiedPeopleDied  https://t.co/2fGoNO1YMo https://t.co/OoVg0NkBlQ
1	This fight isn‚Äôt over. The best thanks you can give a healthcare worker is joining us in this fight against COVID. Please get your vaccines and boosters when eligible.
1	Thank you for your clear statement. My grandmother had polio. She's from a first world country from a time before vaccinations when this still did happen. After the anti-vaccination hysteria, not one person who had known her chose to not vaccinate their children because they could see the results of choosing not to. As living examples of the effects of not protecting become less frequent and the hysteria is allowed to grow without examples and the anti-science activism grows then the first world becomes a more dangerous place. Education about the world and photographs of the effects of these diseases should be mandatory in schools and mandated for those who choose to home school. Unvaccinated children should be prevented from attending public schools. We need herd immunity for those who cannot be vaccinated. Why the more educated society becomes do we seem to be going backwards?
0	Nobody needs it nor should they get it...
1	I got the vaccine simply because I believe in doing the right thing. I couldn't give a rats ass about what side effects it may or may not have, as long as it is helping people
0	They trying so hard for us to be the sacrifice for this vaccine https://t.co/PTA0dyqb4s
1	The anti-vaxx morons wouldn't have been so scared, if it was a pill instead.
0	Cab driver tells passenger she has blood clot She's taken a cocktail of C19 Injections
1	I just got my covid Vaccine today, people wondering do i have covid nope just got the vaccine üòÅüôÇSTAY SAFE EVERYONE
1	Vaccination is a simple and quick way to protect ourselves and others from COVID-19. Don't wait, get your shot today. #VaccinateNow
0	What scares me most about this is there is a No Liability Clause which means I cant sue them and recieve compensation for any damages that might be caused by this even up to death
1	Vaccination is the ultimate shield against the coronavirus. Get protected today.
0	I got a stroke 14 days after my first dose of Pfizer which caused me to get a blood clot in my brain...this is crazy I thought I was the only one
0	There are no benefits to the booster shot, other than ACTUALLY FUCKING dying from it.
1	To every anti vaxer I got the J&J vaccine and no side effects . I‚Äôm still craving human brains before and after
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
1	My friend was vaccinated with his first Pfizer vaccine when his daughter and wife tested positive. His wife was exposed at work from a coworker in the office. My friend felt like he was coming down with something so he got tested-it was negative. He now thinks it was his mind making him feel like he was getting sick or maybe his body was fighting off the virus? Either way, he was grateful that he was vaccinated with his first dose because never had symptoms. He did do the 10 day quarantine because of his exposure to his wife and child. Wife and child had nasal congestion, runny nose, headaches, low grade fevers, fatigue and malaise. They both recovered within two weeks.
1	No matter how much my brothers and I kicked and screamed when it came time to get vaccines my father always made us get them.
1	So, you are telling the world that you will Not take the Vaccine for fear they will chip you and track your every move and you are telling the world this on a Cellphone.
0	A good time and place to put my usual phrase for situations like these: Hold on to your freedom people! You won‚Äôt get it back once you lose it, so never forget how important it is, no matter what the media is telling you.
0	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first.  If they survive, the vaccine is safe.
1	Roses are red, And I'm feeling sweet. Just got my vaccine, So that's p. neat.
1	How do we get those vaccines into arms? Asap. They are safe and effective and COVID is here to stay.
0	Unfortunately for those that have already taken even one mRNA the damage is done and is continuing to be done. Can‚Äôt be taken out ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è
0	Customers for life or until you #DiedUnexpectedly Massive % of #vaccinated people are getting aids like symptoms   "Furthermore, the data confirmed that the immune systems of the fully vaccinated had already degraded to an average of minus 87%." https://t.co/vdIi8OwuC9
0	I regret getting vaccinated, I have series of problems now
1	Just got my vaccine today! Feeling really good and happy. Stay safe everyone <3
1	I'm sick of the rants about the COVID vaccine causing myocarditis. The COVID virus itself causes myocarditis 100 times more often than the vaccine itself. Literally! This means that if you are really afraid of myocarditis then you should DEFINITELY get vaccinated. Good Tuesday!
0	Vaxx supposedly 95% effective.  My immune system 99.9% effective.  The choice is clear.
1	Being vaccinated will make it less likely that you will pass the virus on to others, which means your decision to get the vaccine also protects those around you.
1	COVID feels like a bad flu, I am vaxxed and boosted which I am grateful for. It's nothing you want ever. Taking naps, reading, watching TV. Keep safe everyone.
0	Just shows you how trustworthy vaccines are and still require you to wear a mask
1	I didn‚Äôt want to have any of these shots but got two Astrazeneca shots due to pressure at work. None are 100% safe but I am glad I had AZ shot and not the other two, appears to be better design and safer method of producing the protein.
0	Awful. God have mercy on those being manipulated into getting this hellish unethical, dirty, aborted fetal ce
0	Natural immunity is free Pfizer dont like this
0	Please empathize with those who are vaccine injured, they need your support
1	Got the first done of Moderna yesterday and honestly didn‚Äôt even feel it and I had no side affects. If I get them from the second one I won‚Äôt be mad. Luckily my days off are tues and wendsday do I will already be off the next day.
0	Bad things happen when politicians play doctor...
0	I'm so nervous. My gramps had a stroke and bow has an aneurysm I'm his stomach that he got after the shot and booster. His surgery is scheduled for next week
1	results are coming in get your booster
1	3 shots, sinopharm. People all around me tested positive, but i never did...
0	Over a year on, and I am recovering but I am a shadow of who I was before.
1	My advice to anyone offered the vaccine is to take it. If I can have it at 90, then you can have it too
1	In the UK the vaccine recently became available for 25-29 years olds. I have an exam tomorrow and the first thing I'm going to do after it is book my vaccine appointment.
1	Don't fall for anti-vaccination propaganda - the overwhelming majority of scientists and healthcare professionals agree on the safety and efficacy of vaccines.
1	Vaccination is a crucial step in ending the pandemic and getting our lives back to normal. Don't risk your health or the health of others by delaying getting vaccinated. Talk to your doctor and make an informed decision
0	STOP TAKING THE DEATH SHOT
1	If she didn‚Äôt have the vaccine she may have had long term effects form covid or have died. I am glad she is okay
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	I am a specialist physician and was forced to get the inoculation against unemployment. I have developed life changing tinnitus since, it has destroyed my life. Never forget that there was no informed consent prior to enforcing vaccination.
0	I am now extremely suspicious of every vaccine I ever got. I will never get one again. Dont think ill vaccinate kids either
1	We need a vaccine as soon as possible because the coronavirus is causing people to become ill with COVID-19 and many of them are dying. Is this a trick question?
0	She needs to prove that it saved anyone. It doesn't prevent anything and people have been hospitalized for severe side effects and some died. This shot is dangerous
1	We need to take care of our body! Take vaccines, sleep well, exercise, do not smoke, not drink too much and eat right and drink water only as much as possible.
1	That does not mean I am 100% comfortable. I think there has been little time to understand long term side effects. And even short term side effects are not well communicated
1	this vaccine rant did not age well...
1	i was recently told that we need to be exposed to the SARS-COV2 to build our immune system. how insane is this piece of 'common wisdom'! please do everything you can to avoid infection. #GetVaccinated #WearAMask
0	I‚Äôm still not getting vaccinated.
0	I took the vaccine willingly a year and a half ago. I now have congestive heart failure out of the blue. Something isn't right about this. I nor my family have any history of heart issues. It needs to be investigated.
0	I had an allergic reaction after receiving the vaccine.
1	Getting vaccinated is a small sacrifice that can have a huge impact in stopping the spread of COVID-19. By getting vaccinated, we can protect ourselves and those around us, and pave the way for a brighter future.
1	The proper response to comfort an anti-vaxx parent who lost a child to something preventable is to pat their shoulder, look them in the eye, and say "hey, it's your fault. There were things you could have done" I feel bad for the child. I feel nothing for the parent
1	I know people who have had zero side effects from the vaccine despite having covid
1	I had covid during early days, and I still got vaccinated. My cousin didn‚Äôt get vaccinated and almost died from covid.
1	Biontech you are the best
0	Vaccines are like a shit!
0	I‚Äôm against mandated vaccines. It‚Äôs the individuals choice.
1	Not taking the vaccine is selfish, vulnerable people may die because of it.
0	At 67 years old, i'm so tired of hearing about vaccines. I've been vaccinated and boosted 1 time for covid and i continue to pray up & mask up when going around strangers. So, i have no intention of getting any more vaccinations and i've never gotten a flu vaccine.
1	You can legally make vaccinations a requirement for employment. That solves 80% of cases.
1	You can doubt it all you want but I believe he's responsible for deaths with his attitude towards COVID. The super spreader tourney in the early days to the vaccine refusal later. Get the shot - listen to science - do the right thing for humanity - not that hard.
0	Ha! Being unvaxxed, I am 100% protected against vaccine injury.  I'll take my odds vs hers any day of the week.
1	This is literally a brilliant case study about why we need scientists in government.
1	Antibodies are natural whether they come from infection or vaccination.
1	A bivalent booster dose of #COVID19Vaccine is recommended by public health and available to people aged 5 ; older when 6 months have passed since their last dose or last COVID-19 infection. Learn more at #ProtectMB
1	Do it so your loved ones don't have to endure this terrible pain for the rest of their lives. But please, just do it. Get the vaccine.
0	Bravo to everyone who resisted all the threats, bullying and intimidation by the mainstream media, govs and elites to get the jab. This young woman is a great example that not all Gen Z are sheep and followers to do exactly what "influencers" on social media tell them to do. I have zero jabs and it is one of the proudest things I have done in my life. Yes I had to sacrifice many things, travelling, going to bars/restaurants but it was worth it.
0	Please keep all of your records. Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt know the harm they could cause‚Äù. We knew - they knew.
1	Vaccination is the key to ending pandemic-related restrictions.
1	Don‚Äôt wait, get your #COVID19 vaccine appointment!
1	Vaccination is a vital tool in the fight against COVID-19.
0	every vaccinated person I know has had COVID. not very effective on the virus but it is for pharma
0	I did not take the shot and when I learned what it was, I am glad I didn't.
1	Some people have health issues and covid could literally kill them. They need to stay up to date on their shots.
0	I see these COVID vaccines as a never ending story, kind of like the flu vaccine and they don't always work either.
1	To the point of "I'm not a vulnerable member of society why should i get it?" not only is that selfish, don't forget that covid causes an immune response that causes prolonged inflammation throughout major parts of the body, like the heart, brain, and lungs. You can have underlying conditions you are not aware of that inflammation triggers an event for: stroke, heart attack, etc... Not only that after you're "over it" covid can leave behind a noticeable level of brain fog and fatigue that beguile you for months. Some people's jobs are too risky to be having fatigued or spaced out employees. I don't want to get t-boned by a spaced out truck driver or have my meds mixed up by a fatigued and irritable nurse!!
1	This May help you understand why the fact that a 67 year old died after a short illness recently is not proof that vaccines are killing people
0	If the vaccine was any other product it would have been recalled and, likely destroyed, on safety grounds
1	COVID-19 vaccines are the most effective way to prevent COVID-19. Vaccines can protect us from COVID-19 by preventing us from getting infected at all, and by preventing us from getting sick, ending up in the hospital, or dying ‚Äì even if we are infected. Vaccines can also prevent us from transmitting the virus to others.
0	sure. That vaccine works so damn well it doesn't work at all! Doesn't stop infection. Doesn't stop spread. But it sure kills and maims a lot of people!
1	The simple fact is, COVID 19 is WAY MORE DANGEROUS than the vaccine. My answer is: Anti Vaxxers simply don‚Äôt understand and / or misunderstand statistics. It‚Äôs not hard, look at how many have died from COVID, look how many have died from the vaccine
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why  anyone would  give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually
0	‚ÄúThe vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense.‚Äù
0	Get the vaccine and die , your choice
1	The federal pause on the J&J shot makes no sense
1	My parents got all of theirs, and when they finally got Covid they only had mild symptoms thanks to the vaccines.
1	Vaccines save lives. Period. It's time to beat #COVID19 and #GetVaccinated.
0	I wish I didn't get vaccinated. At least I'm not boosted.
0	How about boosting your immune system with diet and exercise? Also many of the ‚Äúunderprivileged‚Äù have one thing in common, a lack of vitamin D which is extremely inexpensive.
1	46. "I won't be getting the vaccine because I don't think it's effective."
1	Get vaccinated, its safe
1	The anti-vaxxers with whom I‚Äôve spoken seem highly intelligent, which makes their stance puzzling ‚Äî but not entirely. Despite possessing a good intellect, they seem to be missing an essential body of knowledge.
0	Yeah, because soldiers have never been test dummies for unsafe drugs...so sorry that we preferred to wait, for once, to see the effects over time.
1	I got my first VACCINE today! I was on four Waiting lists
1	Vaccination is not just a personal responsibility, it is a social responsibility. By getting vaccinated, you are helping to protect not only yourself, but also others in your community, especially those who cannot be vaccinated
0	I believe in natural immunity, not artificial immunity that doesn't work.
0	But what about the "breakthrough" covid infections?... over half hospitalized are fully vaccinated.
1	I'm anti-seatbelt because I can still die or be injured in a car accident.
0	You take it Great to see how your kids turn out
1	Getting vaccinated not only protects you, but also helps protect those who can't get vaccinated for medical reasons.
0	The fact the Bill states they can use unauthorized medical products, or use medical products in unauthorized ways tells me I don't want it.
0	Anyone, Please help me. I am in a "discussion" with my family about the dangers of the vax. One daughter,PHD, is running circles around me with data points. I am looking for something, preferably a study, she will accept as proof. They want to vax my grandchildren.
0	So if the majority of the population is vaccinated and if the vaccine works, the risk of getting seriously ill and dying from covid is drastically reduced. Yet the risk of serious side effects from the vaccine are not reduced. If there are serious risks in getting vaccinated, while the risk of getting seriously sick from covid is reducing, why are we being forced to take the vaccine?
0	Thank God I didn‚Äôt take vaccine
0	Meanwhile the experts are blaming all of these sudden and unexplained illnesses etc on climate change
0	why in the world would anyone take an experimental unproven injection
1	Thank you @CDCgov !! I'm grateful fr every vax and booster I've ever had!!
1	LET'S GO DARWIN!!! The world will be a better place with anti-science miscreants gone...
0	I‚Äôm still not getting vaccinated.
0	Pfizer should be put on trial, with criminal proceedings, and fined at least 10x the company balance sheet, for what they have done.
1	Misinformation is itself viral in its capacity to speed through all of our lives. We who paid attention in high school biology class are not immune because the naysayers behind us in the grocery line, aggressively unmasked, are doing COVID‚Äôs bidding.
1	Got my first pfizer dose today and feel invincible
0	Remember when the swine flu was raging and then everyone would take a shot. Oh dear, there were side effects left and right.
0	My mother, perfectly healthy, slim, aged 76 - like a ninja for her energy - had a stroke just after her booster. I know her health began to fail after each vaccine. I had one by Pfizer, ended up in hospital heart issues. Still have weird pain stabbing behind my right eye, comes and goes ... like a pressure. Only began after the vaccine. It felt like my body was very toxic for 10 months +
0	Hope you actually SAW all the millions who had "side effects" and MANY thousands that died and never took it.
0	First I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôll get vaccinated. Now I know for sure I will not get vaccinated üòã
0	My friend was model of perfect health and fitness. After receiving his first booster, he no longer has the energy to run every like he used to. He now has a diagnosed case of myocarditis.
1	Lol @ the microchip theory. Disregards even the most basic technical requirements.
1	A majority have been vaccinated and are still healthy.
1	corona vaccine is a lifesaver, quite literally. Get yours now and safeguard your health
0	I literally had covid in July and was sick for 1 day exactly! Unvaccinated. Brother who's vaccinated was sick for about a week. And he's younger.
1	Well Mr intellect it is to prevent severity of the viral infection and death and organ damage so you ok nly have minor infection you can survive unharmed. I am a nurse dont you want your organs, health and life?
1	you should have tried to stay awake in science class. Utter bs from you.
0	Labour and the Tories are both vaccine and passport pushers. Will be voting the Respect Party who aren't into passports or manipulating people into taking vaccines
1	God, I am with you. I have prayed more than I ever have ( no I‚Äôm not a crazy bible thumper just spiritual) and donated money, tried to spread the word, put I got vaccinated on my Facebook frame, tried being reasonable. But like so many others I‚Äôm tired but I am also scared I don‚Äôt want to live like this the rest of my life. Think about the children that are having to grow up in this time. There has been a huge spike in depression in children. Children! Because of the isolation and distancing. If you won‚Äôt do it for yourself at least do it for them.
0	I actually tested positive for Covid even before I got my vaccine. Believe it or not, I was more sick from the vaccine than actual Covid. Since I work in healthcare and pay bills, I had to get the horrible vaccine so I can keep my job.
0	The biggest question on The Vaxx should be. Why did we need a vaccine for a virus that carries a 99.7% survival rate in the first place?
1	If this insane conspiracy was true, u would have a shit ton of vaccinated persons who take Coumadin(a blood thinner) either dropping dead or having to have their dose raised astronomically‚Ä¶.since they are to stupid to use this argument in their conspiracy and not even fox news reporting on this‚Ä¶safe to say its 100% total bullshit that the covid vaccine thickens ur blood‚Ä¶.
0	I got forced into the first dose of Pfizer. I didn‚Äôt end up going to the second dose and instead quit my job. I‚Äôm infertile now. Never had an issue before
1	INTO MY ASS, RIGHT UP IN THERE PLEASE
1	COVID19 is not just a Disease but has economic and social impact and may also come with some law enforcement. Lets get vaccinated. @MOH_Kenya @Ma3Route @VaccinesKenya #USAID #lastmile #PataChanjo #KaaChonjo  #NairobiTukoChonjo #GetVaccinatedNow #COVID19Vaccine
0	The vaccine is not about covid protection. The vaccine is a compliance test. All the sheep are accounted for now
1	Get the vaccine for the elders that do not have the immune system to fight of covid!
1	Everyone who doesn't have a medically documented reason for not being vaccinated should be vaccinated. The pros far outweigh the cons. And it helps protect everyone, including those unable to have vaccines by decreaing their exposure as well. There is no sound reason to not get vaccinated.
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
0	More deadly and horrific complication than covid, wow.
1	Finally happy for this pandemic to be over soon!
1	The two methods currently available for covid vaccine take a different approach. The virus contains a specific protein that allows it to enter your cells and attack it. The vaccine has a piece of genetic code that tells your cells to create this protein. Your immune system then sees that protein and attacks it. Like the other approach, now when it sees the protein on the actual virus, it know how to attack it and kills the protein much quicker. Without the protein, the virus is unable to infect your cells and eventually dies.
1	it's just that we hope there could be less side effects. Some of those side effects are so terrifying.
0	I'm not a anti vaxxer or anything but how quickly they came out with it is worrisome. I have multiple anxiety disorders that make me more scared than the average person but I think I have a right to be scared everyone has a right to be scared. It's the unknown that frightens me. I'm scared of covid and I'm scared of the shot. Us anxiety folks are royally screwed
0	Worried about the people that can‚Äôt go back to work because of ‚Äú long covid‚Äù what about the people fired for not taking this vaccine ?
0	Yep... a few. My grandma died, my step dad had heart failure, my mom had inflammation of the intestines.... but if course I'm the weirdo and those are all coincidence.
0	Pureblood
1	There's going to be a whole cohort of COVID orphans. I can't imagine what it'll be like for them to grow up and find out their parent(s) could have lived if they just got a free, safe, and effective shot.
1	I got jabbed and boosted and still caught covid 3 times. I know I would be dead if I hadn't received the safe and effective vaccine. How many others are thankful to be alive?
1	One student of mine at 17 couldn't get the pyzer vaccine because she's allergic to one of the ingredients but her 15 year old brother got it.  She's going to take the moderna vaccine on her 18th birthday.  I'll give her and her parents credit in trying to do their part.
0	Nothing says 'Trust The Science" quite like "You can't sue us if something goes wrong" and "We need 55 years to release the data to the public"
0	In easier terms, ‚ÄúKeep getting vacced, we want more money.‚Äù
0	They should be tested and audited more!!
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	It's takes 12 years on average for full approval, ya know because that's the only way you test the LONG TERM side affects!
0	How many of you are rethinking all vaccines in light of what we‚Äôve seen with the covid ones? #truth
0	My brother ended up in a wheelchair after the vaccine.
0	Pfizer and the FDA did not want to release the test data. The denominator was still blocked out which means that you can‚Äôt assess risk. Plus, which ages did these occur at? We know that over 65 age needs protection. We know that children are nearly unaffected. The lack of transparency has caused this hesitancy.
0	Side effects that could result in death is still unacceptable even the possibility is low. We need to assure that what we take is safe in each individual. Not only as a whole. If it safe to someone then take it. But never give it to someone just because it is good for others.
1	People have heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots. You know just like hundreds and hundreds of years before the vaccine!
1	Because billions of people around the world have been vaccinated and have safely achieved sufficient immunity to protect them from needing hospital treatment and death. Most people were vaccinated to protect their family, friends and community.
1	These type of responses give me hope for this world #provaccination #proscience #profacts
0	It‚Äôs a bio weapon kill shot 100% it‚Äôs to depopulate and the ones who took it will perish for it
0	There are things in the Covid Jab they are not telling you about. They are determined to infect you with what ever it is as they seem to have a sense of urgency that points to some kind of Deadline they are trying to meet.
0	They can raise it to the high heavens for all I care. Haven‚Äôt taken the shot or any booster. And never will. My Dr advised me not to. And I‚Äôm an insulin dependent diabetic.
0	I'd rather have covid than the horrid side effects.
0	Yep its playing out the exact same way here in Australia. We are 95% fully vaxxed and just had 20,000 cases per day. Everyone I know who is double and triple vaxxed all think the vaccine has saved thier lives and would be dead instead of just sick from omicron. The level of delusion is astounding. Fit healthy 40yo people thinking they would be dead if not for pfizer.. sigh
1	Getting vaccinated feels like taking control in the face of this pandemic. Let's all do our part!
1	The speech at the end about uncertainty is SO TRUE.  I really wish all the anti-vaxxers could understand that one point.
1	Uh, no. Get the proper vaccinations and be unselfish.
0	Scam-demicüòéü§î
1	I'm sick of the rants about the COVID vaccine causing myocarditis. The COVID virus itself causes myocarditis 100 times more often than the vaccine itself. Literally! This means that if you are really afraid of myocarditis then you should DEFINITELY get vaccinated. Good Tuesday!
0	I had to get a vaccine and booster to keep my job. Is there anything I can do now to get it out of my system?  How long does it stay in your system? I got it on the last possible day in order to not get fired
0	What makes me angry is that they keep on going with this deadly global experiment even when they know what they're doing. I never took it never will
0	It‚Äôs a poison injection
0	I had it and plan to remain unvaccinated because I‚Äôve had the flu and the flu was way worse. Besides almost crapping my pants because of cosmic diarrhea Covid was a joke.
1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs the luck of the draw.
0	I think most have come to the realization that the vaccines don't work and there are better ways of managing symptoms. If you hold out the trend will shift away from bad medicine.
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
1	Weird, the conclusions always the vaccine, and never the brand new virus that we don't fully understand and can attack multiple organs.
1	My message for the general public is just to get boosted. Not having booster protection and dropping your guard is much worse than being boosted and dropping your guard.
0	I have a question, and if anyone can answer it, it's false information right away. What are the long-term effects of the vaccine? You'd have to be a time traveler to have the correct answer
1	If too many people refuse to get vaccinated, the virus could mutate and leave our vaccines ineffective. As it is, there‚Äôs talk that the covid vaccine might very well have to become a regular thing like the flu shot.If that‚Äôs the case, then I‚Äôll keep getting vaccinated, again and again, as many times as need be.
1	The answer is whenever you happen to die. Live a healthy and fulfilled life to die at 105? Vaccine.
1	Just get your vaccine man. When it screws you up later in life just remember you stuck to your word. That should bring you comfort
0	You could not pay me enough to get that vaccine
0	I have a friend who tells me that he isn‚Äôt going to get the vax because ‚Äúthere is no way to know what‚Äôs in it and they won‚Äôt tell you‚Äù.
1	I'm pro vaccine The government would never lie to us.
1	Fact: all vaccines are known to interfere with menstrual cycle. Much nicer than dead mom n baby like antivaxx promotes. Happens with immune changes
1	I didn‚Äôt have any side effects
0	I'm excited to get vaccinated! I can't wait to start feeling more normal again.
0	No need. Have natural immunity. 55 years old. It was a head cold. Take C, D, quercetin and ZINC. Caught it in Mexico the day after they lifted the testing mandates. lol.
0	No thx you can have mine. The last ones were deemed "Safe and Effective". That was a huge lie. I already lost 3 pple to that poison. Never again do I trust Global or pharmaceutical companies
0	So let me get this straight, Mark Zuckerberg warned his staff about taking the #mRNA #vaccines but when we warned our friends and family on FB we got banned? Never forget, #NoAmnestyForCovidTyranny #VaccineDeaths #SuddenDeaths2023 #diedsuddenly #vaccinegenocide #Zuckerberg
1	by getting vaccinated, you are taking your health and the health of your loved ones into your own hands.
1	I got the vaccine and thank God I'm alive everyday
0	Why does this dude not mention the BAD side effects, like not AT ALL ...
0	THE COVID-19 TESTS ARE RIGGED. THE DEATH COUNT IS FALSE MASKS ARE USELESS.. VACCINES ARE POISON. THE GOVERNMENT AND NEWS MEDIA ARE LYING.
0	So glad my and my wife never got This poison injected in us.
1	Because people that don't get the vaccine and regret it die of covid
0	Not even a vaccination, really. People are being poisoned by spike proteins through gene therapy.
1	Two years ago the UK reached the milestone of 10million people receiving the #COVID19vaccine - a great achievement. And in #Bexley, we delivered the fastest and widest vaccine roll out in #London. Another reason to be proud to be from #Bexley.
1	The girl that defied her mother‚Äôs views and went to get the vaccine anyway is a heroic and deeply compassionate person!
1	People who have recovered from CoVid19 don‚Äôt need a vaccine? It is a myth. Everyone should get it.
0	I know two people with GB syndrome, caused by the vaccine
1	if you're not going to take the vaccine, please don't interact with anyone in person for any reason.
1	This video definitely helped me because I heard someone talking about a conspiracy theory with the covid vaccine and I started to get paranoid but now I see that they are just crazy
0	It's Time for the Scientific Community to Admit We Were Wrong About COVID
0	Well, they've made a bad decision and want everyone else to make the same bad decision so they feel better about themselves.  That's why most vaccinated people are so desperate to convince others. They don't want to be stranded alone on a deserted island.
0	It was never about winning, it was about warning your fellow human being from danger. It was always about pro choice and not anti vax, but the way the death jab is 'working' I'll happily call myself anti vax.
1	I got my first dose today. I have anxiety disorder and fear of needles but I went. I feel so sad I have to do it again within like 100 days. It was a scary experience. I don't mean to deter anyone from getting their shot. I'm sure most people aren't so scared like me.
0	I like how they ignore literally allllllll of the other evidence in young people. And only relate it to the latest booster. This is strictly damage control
0	Our youth were coerced into these jabs by people who abused their power & authority.
0	This could be the greatest crime in history‚Ä¶they knew about these chronic side effects & lied to us.
0	The vaccine made me feel nauseous.
0	I‚Äôm skipping the vaccine and recommending everyone I know to skip it as well.
0	BigPharma is hopelessly corrupt!
1	Whoever framed how to tell this educational story in seven minutes deserves praise. If that team sees this, well done!
1	I waited in line for four hours to get vaccinated as soon as I was eligible. That one site in NYC vaccinated 11,000 people that day. Lo and behold, our infection rates are way down.
1	It is about  doing your part in preventing the spread of disease.
1	Vaccines are really great!
0	The "Covid Vaccine" is not technically a vaccine. It's an experimental gene therapy that does not stop infection.
1	MY EXPERIENCE: I've had 3 full dose Moderna vaccinations, a normal booster and a bivalent booster shot. 5x. Completely healthy, not even a cold for almost 3 years and ZERO side effects. I have never had Covid.
0	my family is unvax yes we cought the covid and omicron in the first year of out break recovered and I truly believe in having natural immunity after recovering from it. My other family members and friends fully vax + boosters and they still got it. Well im not convinced its working.
1	Yes, I need a vaccine. I interact with hundreds of people every weekend. It‚Äôs my responsibility for me to do my bit to keep both them and myself safe.
1	Thanks Russ. You explained that very well. As a single male I'll eventually get the vaccine. It's right that it's prioritised for those who need it more. üòÅüòÅüòÅüëçüëçüëç
1	As a physician, trying to debunk misinformation is like playing a game of whack-a-mole. As soon as you discredit one, three more pop up. I get frustrated because you‚Äôre constantly playing catch-up. I‚Äôve run out of empathy for selfish people.
0	My whole family just got ill with it. We could lose everything
1	Getting vaccinated is a personal responsibility we all have to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities. #VaccinesWork
1	A lot of people at my school are against the vaccine. It feels good to be one of the few that‚Äôs getting it.
0	The best defense is no defense because you are already safe and nothing can harm you when you know who and what you really are. The Truth Will Set You Free.
0	They activated the microchip bro
0	Glad I used my brain and waited for the data. The gaslighting to get this experimental vaccine was enough for me to be heavily skeptical and not taking it. My educated guess may have saved me from the side effects that have been plaguing friends and family of mine. Growing up I watched PBS, Canadian television was junk in the 90s so it was mostly American cartoons we watched. The Magic School bus taught a generation to question everything, and thanks to Ms Frizle I may have avoided a huge problem lol.
1	the vax was NEVER keeping us from getting it at all...its to make covid less severe, why don't you educate yourself instead of spreading lies
1	Yes, I will be vaccinated. It might feel a little scary for the first month or so, but then I'll probably take it.
0	1st of all, these are injection, they are not vaccines!  Good luck to all those who rolled the dice and took the experimental juice!  Health can ONLY be found in a needle, right?
0	My sister's friend became unwell immediately after the second jab with hand paralysis which seemed to clear up. Despite this she had the booster she is now paralysed and in a wheelchair.
1	This video gave me chills. It also confirms my belief that many covid anti vaxxers would rather die than get vaxxed.
1	I've had two doses of the vaccine but after these vaccines are tested with the delta variant I'll take my booster doses
0	As a concerned citizen l request a full list of the ingredients of the vaccines to be made available to the public by the WHO. I also request a full independent report on the safety of these vaccines to be made available to the public.
1	This cardiologist is boosted and doing all i can to protect myself, patients and others
1	I've had all the ones I will be taking thankyou. Imagine if your dog had a rabies vaccination and still caught it
1	getting vaccinated was a no-brainer for me - it's the least I can do to protect myself and those around me.
1	I just had my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Thankfully, aside from sore arms and a day of malaise, there has not been any serious complications among the hundreds of folks at the healthcare facility where I am employed. I am sure there are folks in other places who have experienced terrible side effects. I do hope no one else gets the virus, regardless of whether or not they decide to take the vaccine. God bless you all.
1	just got my second dose yesterday! God bless everyone, stay safe
0	You need to develop a vaccine that does not put people at dangerous risks of blood clots, strokes, anaphylactic shock, bells palsy and heart disease.
0	unvaccinated here 2022 immune system 100%
1	First dose for me gave me mild symptoms whereas the second one was a lot worse! Its all good in the hood now!
0	I'd someone, either the producers themselves, or the government would take financial responsibility for the side effects, I would take it right now!
0	Can mandate it all they want. Not taking it
1	Getting my COVID vacation tomorrow and im scared for my life
0	Never again. And stop vaccinating your pets! My small dog was getting constant ear infections and skin irritation. Stopped giving him any vaccines and he has been all clear for about a year now.
0	Nothing says 'Trust The Science" quite like "You can't sue us if something goes wrong" and "We need 55 years to release the data to the public"
1	These people cannot be reasoned with. I know this and yet I want to ask them a million questions to try and show them how fragile and inconsistent their beliefs are.
1	Feels good! I did my part, now can't wait to have my oldest and parents vaccinated.
0	AstraZeneca, Moderna, Biontech/Pfizer are very reliable vaccines that have cleared even the high hurdles of the European Union. In my opinion, if they are allowed to be published in China at all, the risk from Covid19 is much greater than using one of the vaccines listed above. Biontech, in particular, has hardly any side effects and a simultaneous efficacy of 95%.
0	Someday we will view vaccines to be as barbaric as lobotomies.
1	I'm glad that i got my second dose yesterday
1	Rockland County has banned unvaccinated children from public spaces and will punish those who contravene the order with up to six months in prison and a $500 (¬£378) fine.
0	If the unvaxxed were having strokes, heart issues & 'dying suddenly' it would be blasted from every major media outlet every day.  Except they aren't suffering.  So we have no investigations, no headlines & a co-ordinated conspiracy of silence.
0	IT'S TRUE "too many lives have been lost to COVID-19 vaccination"!!!
1	In addition to clinical trial data, evidence from real-world vaccine effectiveness studies shows that COVID-19 immunizations help protect against COVID-19 infections, with or without symptoms.
0	#fuckvaccination cases of children with strange myocardial disease continue to appear, due to vaccines against covid, gentlemen until when no more, let's save our children #faucimurder
1	Geez I hope this clears it up for many people I‚Äôm sick of Listening to my aunt about vaccines being dangerous
1	Sinovac enjoyer
1	Don't wait any longer. IMMEDIATELY get your booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine for our common well-being.
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like ‚Äúno more vaccines‚Äù. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years‚Ä¶
0	The Germans are so smart, I envy their leadership. The fact that they don't lie to their people, and treat their citizens like gold. Maybe we fought and died on the wrong side of WWI/WWII.
0	It's weird how some people just don't consider the chance of DYING by a vaccine that has bearly been tested
1	I got my first dose of Moderna last month on the 17th, getting my second dose today. The guy who gave me the shot was AMAZING omg I didn‚Äôt even feel the needle, I hope he‚Äôs there today haha
0	Where's the apology to everyone who was screaming not to get vaccinated and literally said this would play out exactly like it has.
0	If they would have allowed early treatment the vaccine would not have reduced death.. we need to acknowledge what Dr McCullough was saying from the start
1	Cant wait for this shit to be over, I hope everyone gets vaccinated ASAP!!!
1	These guys were super insulated from the horror show that hospitals were during the surges and how our regularly functioning health care system was literally crippled.
0	Jabs increase likelihood of covid infection‚Ä¶
0	I'm the 7% at 62 years old in England who haven't had the jab. It amazes me how many have jumped to the beat. These are still trials.
0	‚ÄúThe vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe. If they don‚Äôt, then the country is safe.‚Äù ‚ÄîMonika Wisniewska
1	Vaccine shot #Moderna
0	I will never take the vaccine
0	Is more dangerous yet to come?
1	Why are you guys close minded to see the facts that vaccines work?
1	Love how 1/1000 people get a horrible side effect and that makes other people not want to be vaxxed, but do whatever you want
1	I don't understand what's so scary about getting a life saving vaccine. Then again I'm not a fucking idiot so why try to understand?
1	Haven't had the Pfizer shot but the work Biontech is doing is paving the way for better cancer treatments.  Personalised vaccine for cancer is a possibility. So go ahead and be the anti vaxxer if you want - will you change your mind for this? Maybe.
0	Instead of using more toxic vaccinations to theoretically prevent a disease, we should avoid all vaccines
1	The anti-vaccine movement has literally become a death cult at this point. The next two months are going to be insane to watch.
0	Soon enough all the commercials about the water at Camp Lejueune will be replaced with Covid vax class action commercials.
0	We also have vaccines that loses efficacy in record time even despite boosters and has lead every major vaccine developer to ignore the pain and the suffering they've caused by the mounting numbers of vaccine injured world wide because all of these vaccines - especially the ones used in western nations - were developed too fast and peddled to the public too quickly. Now add in the fact there's numerous studies coming out every month almost recently detailing how dangerous they potentially are for people who take them and...well, I'm sure almost everyone who did and didn't take them wish we hadn't left the early treatment approach behind so quickly.
1	Watching because I'm scheduled for my AZ vaccine on Thursday.
1	Vaccinations are expensive and the government is providing them free to citizens. Why would you not want it?
0	Whatever. You go right ahead John and get your safe and effective experimental vaccine. Hard pass for me.
0	So many of my friends and family so easily and so quickly abdicated their bodily autonomy and submitted to an imaginary ‚Äòcure‚Äô for a condition that was about as deadly as the common seasonal flu
0	Exactly!!! Just say No!! It's not a vaccine. It's gene therapy that's why it's Not working. mRNA's have Never been successful. There's a reason. This 'Jab'  or 'shot' will destroy your immune system. Among other things. Bill Gates and Fauci just want to kill you!! Just say No!!
1	I get my second dose this Saturday, hopefully all goes well with no symptoms but I rather be safe then sorry so I'll gladly take the symptoms over getting the virus.
1	Ignore the vaccine haters.
0	Refrain from taking under tested Gene therapy shots (aka Covid ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù)
0	Untested on animals, data hidden for years, ingredients undisclosed. What could go wrong?
0	I refuse to take it, I lost my job for it, but it worth it... Those people need to be arrested.
1	He does not need to put a Chip YOU HAVE A PHONE !!!!
0	They shouldn't still be forcing the covid jab with all the reports of problems. But they will.
1	The supply chain to save the world is unprepared
1	Wonderful to know all vacine can avoid the death
1	In a way she's right. People don't really die of covid anymore, they die of vaccine refusal.
0	I'll trust anecdotal evidence from a random stranger on the internet before I trust my government. They've been caught in too many lies about Covid, and life in general.
0	Here is my strategy, avoid the poison $hot at all costs.
1	I got my 2nd shot from Moderna. I am so glad I finally got it!
1	I'm from Indonesia and i got 3 vaccines shot. All are AstraZeneca and I'm fine till today
1	I recently found out that I‚Äôm allergic to an antibiotic. I had a severe reaction to it where I ended up being sick even after I stopped taking it. I know someone else who had a reaction to this same antibiotic. Therefore, no one should take this antibiotic, even though it might help with illnesses, because clearly based on my own personal experience it is too dangerous for everyone to take. It would be much better if everyone just dealt with being sick. (This is fully sarcasm)
1	The comment section shows us all , that the US educational system has failed , let's hope natural selection will help us.
1	Wait so MTG wants to investigate the vaccine ‚Äúkilling people suddenly‚Äù in response to Diamond‚Äôs sudden death even though Diamond didn‚Äôt get the vaccine?
0	Well, the first step is getting a doctor to admit the vaccine caused the death.
1	Great video...honest, real, and very encouraging for those of us ready to get the vaccine.
1	I was called a child abuser by an anti-vaxxer once. How ironic
0	To think that they would force an experimental drug in healthy adolescents, is an absolute scandal‚Ä¶
1	He made the right choice for two reasons: the shot hasn't been tested long enough and no employer should force you to take it.
1	Good to know that anyone can be a nurse or doctor, even the most mentally bankrupt.
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
1	I am a #ProVaxxer . I‚Äôve listened to the scientists, not the politicians. I can‚Äôt wait. I think I can handle mild side-effects of a day after 9 months of hardship and weirdness...
0	I won't marry vaccinated women
1	I realise this video is 8 months old, but it probably needs some comment about the very low risk of blood clots. I have now had both shots, although they were 12 weeks apart, not 4. I also believe I developed temporary Bradycardia, around 3 weeks after the first shot and less than a week after the second, perhaps because of the 1/2 dose, full dose scenario. I would do it again because vaccines save lives, but it wasn't much fun.
1	I haven't met an anti masker or anti vaxxer who wasn't a pure douche bag. Fuck these guys, I have no sympathy seeing them get there ass kicked by the delta varient. Natural selection at work.
0	Get ready for 99 boosters in the next 5 years...
0	20 to 30 million body count on these so called vaccines!! It's unforgivable!! I'm a very angry citizen of the US!!
1	"Anti-vaxxers are basically nuts." Well & simply said
1	Getting my second #Moderna shot right now, so I can tell qreeps and extremist chr*stians that I have the Mark of the Beast üòà
1	idk, he‚Äôs pretty pro vaccine without very much data to back it up.
1	The video was intelligent, the message clear, the sad thing is that all the sick patients and nonvaxers seem self centered with no sense of altruism. A fact that is clear is this seems to be a political issue not humanitarian
0	No. Stop ruining your immune system. Go to a naturopath.
0	Doctor Ryan Cole says the jabs are causing cancer
1	my fianc√©e and I were very closely exposed to 7 people, one symptomatic at the time of exposure, who tested positive for covid in the past 2 weeks. We are both negative after 10 day. The vaccine works.
1	At least we have the option to help protect ourselves from many different pathogens. If we look back at recorded history, we see that many never had the chance. This is why I‚Äôll never understand the anti vaccine mindset.
1	Statistics show that since the COVID-19 vax came out, COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths decreased dramatically.
1	I can‚Äôt force somebody else to get a vaccine, nor can they force me. I‚Äôm not angry at anyone, my vaccination protects me and I‚Äôm content with that.  If people want to take that risk themselves then that‚Äôs on them.
1	I resently got my second shot of the Pfizer vaccine. All I got was a sore arm both times. I was expecting to get a little fatigue but didn't.
1	When you get a vaccine it‚Äôs a less severe form of Covid 19 that lets your body produce antibodies for it so if you ever do come into contact with someone who has Covid you will be able to fight it off I‚Äôm pretty sure
0	What is funny is, when people started noticing you could still get COVID after the vaccine, they called it "breakthrough case" instead of just saying the vaccine didn't work.
1	More people were permanently disabled or killed by COVID-19 than by the COVID vaccine - by several orders of magnitude
1	While some may have concerns, I believe the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine far surpass any potential risks.
1	l had 2 vaccines and l am 32yrs old
1	I just think the idea of getting your panties in a twist over this one vaccine compared to ALL of the other liberties and rights to yourself that you give away as a service-member, is pure political nonsense. But then again, thats par for the course with these losers.
1	It's convincing.. People have faith in scientific fraternity.. That in record time safe & trusted vaccine has been developed
1	I'm pretty sure your body would be less able to take the side effects of getting COVID. Even though you said you got COVID twice the vaccine is still recommended. Serious vaccine side effects are very rare compared to what would happen if you got COVID. Please don't look at VAERS, which is NOT a list of side effects. Of myself and coworkers we all had mild side effects for about a day or two but that shows the vaccine is working. You should take it to protect yourself and loved ones.
0	Don‚Äôt complain about how you can‚Äôt find new employees, if you‚Äôre firing your current employees over a shot.

1	I am really happy that these vaccines rae available!

0	This is DeSatan posturing to be the tough guy he wishes he could be. Thats all.
0	Absolutely never ever, I like my DNA, just the way it is thanks
0	My turn? I am unvaccinated and untested and covid free for two years. Did I miss "my turn" ? Thank God
0	99.6% survival rate. Join us in reality and turn your tvs off people.
0	I literally despise what the political elites have done to America. Think of any derogatory word and many politicians would have that quality.
0	Yes, it is literal insanity. I'm seeing people around me question the narrative, admit it's really not that big of a deal, explain to me how the vaccine seems unnecessary, and then within 24 hours come back and proudly explain to me that all of their children are now vaccinated.  Like I should be clapping or something.  Meanwhile, I'm just very confused as to why they vaccinated kids.
1	Safety IS liberty, in this instance. Busineses, schools, everything can open up if people just practice safety. These people are weighing down the rest of us.
1	COVID-19 vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been shown to be highly effective. Don't hesitate, get vaccinated. #ScienceWorks
1	we are living in a good time
0	There was no valid reason to take the shots. None.
0	Ain't nothing good about the vaccine!!!!!!! Just the fact that they're trying to force it on you and they tell you at first you going to wait 75 years for the results that should tell you right there don't get nowhere near it!!!!!!!
0	It's possible that Michael's bleeding condition has been developing subtly for some years. Michael may have just happened to have symptoms at the same time as his inoculation, he said.
1	Just get the vaccine it's not that big of a deal
0	You should make a video discussing why children and athletes are collapsing from heart attacks after taking these, cheers.
0	We need a Bernstein & Woodward to expose the Covid vaccine harm scandal. Come on journalists, do your job.
1	Same conspiracy theorists that say fluoride in the water is bad and that 5g is radiation and COVID is a hoax.

1	Thank you for this! I'm a young person, but I work with the public. I live in a rural area and my local health dept. has a standby list for vaccines that my boss signed me up for when she learned about it (she knew I'd want to be on it). I get the first of the Moderna vaccines tomorrow. I've never been excited to get a shot before, but I certainly am now!
0	The pfizer vaccine gave me permanent side effects, particularly ear aches and very loud tinnitus. I regret ever giving in to the pressure.
1	3 managers at my work are going to quit because work is asking people to be vaxxed. They have no job prospects literally throwing away your life because of a conspiracy theory
0	Shut the f up. Murderers. Keep your poison away from our kids. People are waking up to your lies
1	I feel so much safer now that I've received my COVID-19 vaccine.
1	I got my 2nd shot from Moderna. I am so glad I finally got it!
0	Just watching them give this shot pisses me off. How can you just sit there and take someone's life like that with no thought of karma or anything. Doctors have a choice to protect their patients or kill them this will be on all heads who think money before someone's life. It is not yours to take. Therefore Yours will not be yours to keep. Stay woke Sincerely, a pissed off Indigenous Goddess
1	I got the covid vaccine. I was sick for a week and then I got better. Now I haven't had to worry about covid in months. Funny, its almost like the vaccine trained my immune system how to understand covid and thus begin to build a defense.

0	I know someone with 5 covid vaccines and had covid 3 times. Me not vaccinated from covid at all, had it once lol.
0	Will never take it and now have lost trust in the medical community.  No flu shot or any shot  for a long time.
1	Getting vaccinated is one of the best things you can do to protect yourself and others from the coronavirus.
1	You mean people who went to college can‚Äôt be trusted more than the person with an expertise on money and gossip?
1	The vaccine hesitant: "I just don't trust it. There isn't enough data or studies. I don't have COVID. These doctors are lying to me."  Also the vaccine hesitant: goes to hospital and lets the medical staff stuff tubes and medicine and needles into them to try to save their lives
1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs the luck of the draw.
1	I am thrilled to be en route to New York to do some vaccine promotion work with UNICEF.
1	Didn‚Äôt notice any change after getting vaccinated
1	I also was anti-vax. I was more the "I never got vaccines and I only had the chicken pox" type. I didn't ridicule others for getting it or stand real harsh about it. I planned to claim the religious exemption for my kids like my parents had done for my sister and I. When my daughter got cancer (pre-B ALL) it started to change. I had confidence in the chemotherapy but wouldn't allow vaccinations. As I started to think about it more it changed my viewpoint. I have gotten vaccinated for Covid and plan to get my children up to date with their vaccinations. I understand.
0	I went to get my vaccine. I read the disclaimer form and said no thanks. I am not signing that and walked out.

0	I will NOT be forced to take a shot.
1	Don't believe the misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. The benefits far outweigh any potential risks.
0	I believe that vaccines can cause chronic health conditions.
1	even within counties with free and easy access to vaccines there is a huge portion of people who don't want to be vaccinated, unfortunately it's usually the same group of people who are against all restrictions, masks, testing etc. and they don't obey them. and the worst part is, they think that their actions only affect them, sometimes they simply don't believe their behaviour can hurt others
0	I tried to stop my daughter from getting it. She was 16 and lived with her mom (democrat) who said she wouldn‚Äôt get the trump vac but when Biden got in office it was ok & everyone needed it or else
0	I‚Äôve never heard anyone regret not taking the covid vaccine. But I keep hearing people regret taking it. Anyone else notice this?
1	I've had 5 shots and just  turned  77 years young. Active and healthy.
1	You may have a sore arm and fatigue for a few days and that's very likely it. Get the vaccine
0	My dad almost died after getting his Covid shot. He was hospitalized then eventually moving to a retirement home. He lost the ability to walk after being bedridden for so many months.   Doctors were quick to deny that the shot had anything to do with it. They were quick to change the subject too.
0	2years later: have you or a loved one taken the covide vaccine ? You may be entitled to substancial compensation !!
1	A year ago today we lost my Aunt Kay to Covid at the age of 75. Sadly it was before the vaccine came out.
1	Q: How do I stop my son from getting himself vaccinated?  A: Accept the fact that your son is a lot smarter than you and has common sense
0	People taking these vaccines need to wake the fuck up!!!
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice...  I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after.
1	This is too much science for anti-vaxers
1	My dad has been a physician for 30 years, is an expert in public health, and led the covid response in our county and he says the vaccine is safe and effective. Are you suggesting he would lie and put his own children at risk?
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	You guys should take the first shot and the second shot and the thirt shot and all those boostershots and make a weekly vlog of it... than you g u guys are THA MEN
0	I cannot trust a vaccine produced this quick. So many steps skipped.
0	Stroke, aneurysm 2 wks after Covid vaccine booster. Overnight, stopped breathing temporarily, had seizures.
0	Every one of my family and friends that got the jab, except 1, have had reactions from heart attack, stroke and 1 is blind. My aunt kept getting boosters and had strokes and now shakes uncontrollably - her new doc just told her to stop getting them. Ugh. This is a horror story
0	‚ÄúIf you give that jab to your child you are committing a crime.‚Äù
1	Kids are as likely to be infected with COVID-19 as adults ; can spread COVID-19 to others. COVID-19 can make children very sick and cause children to be hospitalized.  Call 438-802-7727 to make your appointment today.  #Covid19 #FightCovid19 #Covid19Vaccine #Covid19USA #Pandemic
0	No way, not even if they try take my job and freedom I still won‚Äôt let them put that crap in me. Mark of the beast for sure
0	It‚Äôs concerning most people don‚Äôt know Pfizer unblinded their COVID-19 vaccine control group 2.5 months into the trial and gave them shots.  We will never truly know the long-term safety effects of COVID-19 vaccines.
1	Science has shown that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and highly effective, so let's do our part to stop the spread.
1	I see my doctor every 2-3 months for private health reasons. he has a phd in this field and has been studying immunosuppressive medicine and vaccines for 30 years he straight up told me to get it. since this day i have not been sick at all. no runny nose no coughs no headaches no temperatures and i used to get that a lot before i got the vaccine
1	Obviously when quacks posing as doctors or experts tweet non scientific garbage that can kill people they should not only be banned but should be subjected to the virus in strong doses. Let's see how they do. Anyone that thinks the vaccine doesn't work or covid isn't a real virus should also be subjected to the virus. Governments role is to save people not let them listen to idiots that probably got their degree from trump university.
0	Many believed emergency use authorization meant full and safe approval of the vaccines. It is not! Natural immunity is still important.
0	I'm SO glad I'm not the only one who still trusts his gut feeling and discernment about things! Just because the government and some doctors, in whom many of us trust, press people to follow through with something, it does NOT mean there's justification behind it. I did not allow nor encourage my family to get the poison. I sincerely hope that those who fell victim to this negligence find some sort of peace and healing
1	I can still see plenty of people refusing them, even if they were 100% effective.
0	had covid in march it was just like a normal flu with a little fever i wasn't vaccinated at that time but now i got my 2 vac and i had extreme headache body pain chills fever way worse than covid itself -_-
0	If it will be finalized with precise results that it would totally cure or prevent the patient from COVID then why not but till now there is no vaccine that has arrived in the market which can promise this accurately! Different Companies are doing trials with a lot of bad side effects which can cause you other diseases or hormonal imbalance! So, nowadays I don't believe in any fake Vaccine which is arguing that it will prevent the COVID. Hoping for a reliable source in the future!
0	Millions? Tell that to Japan as they keep setting records for deaths despite high vaccination rates.
0	Fuck BionTech!
0	No one knows how long this ‚Äúprotection‚Äù will last or whether you‚Äôll be taking these shots every six months for the rest of your natural life; no one knows how many people will die from the shot who would otherwise have dealt with the virus just fine.No thanks, I don't need a vaccine
1	Vaccine + Booster = Protection against COVID-19 and a safe summer! Book your vaccine and booster or walk in to any of our health department locations to receive this service with no appointment required. #ItsThatSimple #COVID19Vaccine
1	Whichever scientists can succeed in destroying Covid and giving us back human life - not the lives lost, but the lives still living - those scientists are indeed heroes.
0	These people don‚Äôt know how sick they could be.
1	As long as my grandparents get it as soon as possible, I'll be happy, I'm young and I would be fine to wait as long as possible, I just want my grandparents to have it so they can leave their house, all 4 of them have become really upset this year. This year was my maternal grandparents 50th Anniversary and they planned this big party and no once could go, I just want them to be safe and happy more than anyone
1	I started having adverse reactions to vaccines starting in college very similar to the lady speaking in this video. I developed a chronic pain disorder from them but I still wish that I could continue to get vaccinated. I am provax because I need others to get vaccinated to protect me. I am one in a million and I will most likely never meet anyone like me.
1	My daughter is a scientist for Moderna, im so proud of her
0	Forcing people to take the poison should be treated as a criminal act.  All who pushed for the poison to be distributed should be imprisoned!
0	It‚Äôs possible the military vaccine is different from the public version (to save the military from the poison)
0	Let me get this straight it's a fairly new technology but its safe. No serious concerns except for those who died or have disability. Clinical trials are not done until 2023 but it's safe. INGENIOUS! Thank you
0	Avoid these vaccines at all costs! These things are from Satan. I am not saying this is "Mark of the Beast" but these mrna vaccines do change your genetics. You don't want to be a genetically modified human. Mass numbers of people are dying from these shots so I don't care about the backlash that comes with telling the truth on vaccines.
0	"I'm not trying to persuade you but - I AM"
0	They were rushed, they don‚Äôt prevent spread, just make you feel better and have side effects like seizure, heart issues, blood clots etc. plus they shouldn‚Äôt be forced to be put into people against their will.
0	I don't touch the stuff. Bragging that you survived poison isn't the W you think it is.
0	Almost exactly 9 months after the mRNA vaccinations started, we saw a massive drop in the birthrates in Sweden. Why isn't this bigger news?
0	How come Covid vaccine commercials don't announce the side effects like the rest...
1	Vaccinated guy here, I spend my downtime getting high to distract me from my anger. Not at governments, not at the virus. It's anger at other people. Humans. I barely tolerate the idea that I am of this species, when fellow humans continue to whine and cry and fuss over a modern medical breakthrough like mRNA vaccines.  I heard on the radio today that the average reading level of American adults is 7th grade. How the hell are these people supposed to understand mRNA vaccines? Maybe I should feel sad for these dumb people but I don't. I do NOT.
1	Exciting progress. Vaccines that address variants are crucial to ending this pandemic.
1	despite the soreness in my arm, the next i felt really good and was ready for the gym
0	Another Pro Tennis Player suddenly dies ! All these sudden deaths by Athletes? The Vaccine !
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	I got COVID for the first time in early December. I have the original two vaccines and two boosters. I had a slightly snotty nose. That's it. I wouldn't have even known I had it if I hadn't taken a test before I was supposed to go see my newborn niece. Meanwhile my antivaxxer dad was trying to tell me I couldn't possibly have COVID because I wasn't sick. Nah bitch that's the power of vaccines ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏è
1	I‚Äôm calling on everyone eligible to come forward for the vaccine - whether it‚Äôs your first jab or your booster. The vaccine saves lives and will protect you and your family #GetBoosted
0	I dont regret it at all. Never took it, never wore a mask either.
0	Ok, it didn't work the first 4 times, but the 5th will be the charm Haaha!
1	Long Covid cripples millions ; best protection is vaccination, say experts   #longcovid | #covid19vaccine | #cardiovasculardisease | #acuteillness | #covidcases | #healthnews   Read more at:
0	When you refer to the seasonal flu shot, I totally agree with that approach for this vaccine as well....it might work but it poses serious risks and on some populations
1	Make me get the vaccine
0	Is it okey to not give CPR to a vaxxed person?
1	As a nurse, please get the vaccine it really does help!
0	I refuse to live my life in fear!
0	Side effect - death. Enough said.
0	"You MUST get the experimental mRNA vaccine!" "The world will never go back to normal without it!" "You should lose your job if you don't get vaccinated!" "The unvaccinated shouldn't be allowed to leave their home!" Major red flags from the very beginning. Always trust your gut.
1	Listen, any positive news regarding vaccines is fantastic. Step in the right direction üëè https://t.co/mp267jysFF
0	My doctor advised against me getting it, unless I really wanted to. From his research, anyone active and in good health are generally safe.
0	Please do your research before you take the Covid vaccine, Do Not trust what anyone tells you.
1	Study shows people report less side effects with second booster, and no serious events.'
0	The vaccines are dangerous.
1	We have these miracle vaccines that can hugely decrease the risk of death or hospitalization and we should all get them.I just got my bivalent booster and happy to protect my parents & other vulnerable ppl. #GetVaxxedNow
0	How about the vaccine not being FDA approved?
1	it's from a disease, specifically a virus. You may know it as covid-19. Surprisingly, it is not the first pandemic ever. (shock). I can say this with almost certainty because mRNA is an extremely necessary molecule to our bodies and has a short lifespan. I think it's about time we all admitted that billions of people have had mRNA vaccines, if there were concerning side effects we would all know about it.
1	It probably does. I‚Äôd advocate going to the pediatrician just to double check.
0	God knows what ingredients are in that vaccine... I really don't want to inject something unknown into my body
0	The derogatory term "anti-vaxx" was coined to silence critics of vaccines, including ppl with autism such as myself. Transmission of once rampant viruses is prevented by improved sanitation, mainly cleaner water; NOT vaccines.
1	The COVID-19 vaccination offers strong protection against serious illness.
1	The earlier we begin vaccinating, the earlier we can stop the disease from developing into a type that is resistant to the present vaccinations. Start massive vaccination programs instead of virtue signaling with these absurd vaccine criteria.
1	It's important to understand that the entire vaccine misinformation campaign is mostly about redirecting blame away from Trump and his disastrous handling of the pandemic.
1	You choosing not to vaccinate yourself does not affect solely you. You choosing not to vaccinate is killing other people. You have blood on your anti-vax hands.
1	Jax got his flu shot and Covid vaccine today because we know vaccines work
1	It‚Äôs best to get shots in your dominant arm to workout the soreness. I work in healthcare so yeah.
1	for vax, I think(and its my opinion) everyone need take them(the basic one at least) because there are so much illnesses that has been reduced that overwise could make people drop like flies rn. and most on the anti vaxer became so because of the extremely strong adverse effect they got, well that mainly them having a bad reaction. Its like allergies, just because someone cant eat peanuts does not mean its dangerous for everyone, its actually very healthy and recommended to be eaten
0	When did you first realize covide was a scam?
1	WHY ARE THERE SO MANY ANTI VAXXERS IN THIS THREAD GET YOUR VACCINES UNLESS YOU HAVE A MEDICAL REASON NOT TO
0	I have had weird heart palpitations, anxiety and other symptoms which I had put down to a pre-existing condition, but it got substantially worse after the second vaccination, looking back on it.
0	It makes me sad when people say ‚Äúwell you won‚Äôt be able to attend football games or get on a flight if you don‚Äôt get it so good luck‚Äù. Never once have those things sounded more appealing than having a right to my body, and those of you who are doing it solely to have a social life are making it hard for people who are trying to protect your rights!
1	Had my first dose of Astra today, the pain on the jab area was way worse than my flu vaccine shot last year, it works!
0	This is my experience: I have had Covid-19 twice with mild symptoms. I am not vaccinated. My 53 year old aunt got her two jabs and still got hospitalised with Covid. My 36 year old colleague died due to adverse reaction to his first jab. Who is better off? Why should I get the jab if my immune system already proved effective without the risks associated with the vaccine?
0	You can‚Äôt see long term side effects in the short term.
0	NO cure for the COMMON COLD in decades but a vaccine for ‚Äúcovid‚Äù apparently produced in 6 weeks???   I don‚Äôt fucking think so - what absolute unadulterated bollocks!!!!!!
1	I‚Äôm not sure ‚Äúpuzzled‚Äù was the right word. They had at least two possible reasons - vaccine hesitancy and refusal to follow mitigation strategies (masking, social distancing, etc.) but we‚Äôre unable to quantify which made more,of a difference.
1	As bad as a mandated #CovidVaccine would be, they could instead penalize people for not taking the vaccine
0	THE DEATH AND INJURY NUMBERS SPEAK FOR THEM SELVES ITS A HUMAN CULL BY VACCINE FOR A FAKE PANDEMIC VACCINE
0	I'm concerned about the potential impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on my mental health."
1	So many damn people disliking the video and talking about "the low risk" You NEVER say NEVER and you NEVER say ALWAYS. That's why the risk is LOW. But the chances that the benefits outweigh the risks are really HIGH. Get it? Comprende?
0	What about the conspiracy theory that it‚Äôs a way of injecting nano chips...?
1	I personally vaccinated few months ago . Now i have suffering from covid 19, but due to this vaccination i recovered in 4 days. So i think vaccination is A LIFE SAVING DOSE. please everyone get vacvination...
1	I am ready for my booster, hurry up FDA. This finding was hardly a surprise, but I appreciate finally hearing something definitive. I have retreated into my house again because of Delta and concern about my lagging J&J protection. With a booster I will feel more confident to resume shopping, dining out, and in-person entertainment and recreation.
0	I'm quite adept at asking questions. Because I have, I know that Covid probably wouldn't have killed us all. Only one in a thousand (until it mutated - which is has (twice so far)). I am unwilling to sacrifice the one in a thousand, even if it was you.
1	You don‚Äôt get vaccinated for to protect yourself, you do it to protect your families and loved ones!
0	THEY REALLY want to make sure that we all die!! Why bother giving us the live virus through a shot? Just line us all up with our hands and feet bound, and spray it in our faces!!
0	Remember the coercion, the mandates, the lockdowns, the forced injections, the proof of vaccination required... Never forgive those who enforced this tyranny, crimes against humanity. All WEF & pharma/government persons must be held accountable. Be it via SADS or tribunals.
1	Great job simplifying and differentiating the different types of vaccines. I work in healthcare and many of my colleagues are refusing free vaccines because they don‚Äôt understand how it works.
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
0	Covid isn't even that serious. But injecting a virus into my body? No way!
0	Feel sorry for all the people who thought they were doing the world some good for getting there vaccine. Pray for humanity
1	I thank the lord that I'm grateful that I'm not living in the US where stupidity spread the virus. I'm grateful that I live in Asia where we do not let individuality get in the way of preventing the virus spread.
0	But it‚Äôs also extremely dangerous and not every body is going to react the same
1	Looking forward to the new shot. Yes, fast track it. I'll be at CVS as soon as its available.
0	I know more people on their 5th shot and have gotten Covid 2+ times than I kno unvaccinated to have gotten it a second time.
1	Always trusted vaccines, but I never knew how different the newer ones are from past vaccines.
1	Vaccines are our best defense against COVID-19 and will help us get back to normal.
0	Anti vaxx disinformation is active 24/7!
1	The covid vaccine was never going to stop all transmission. that was the whole point made by zero covid. We allowed new variants to develop which made the vaccine less effective. Unfortunately now anti-vax people are seizing on it as proof all vaccines are bunk.
0	Here in Canada, our fearless leader is STILL pushing the jabs üôÑ
0	My mother told me " Never take drugs from convicted felons with legal indemnity . "
1	Two of my immediate family members have perished from Covid...both unvaccinated.
1	More people need to be. Vaccinated to stop the spread .
1	I dodged the damn thing for almost 3 years, but Thanksgiving and showing a guest around Santa Fe and my luck ran out. But thanks to Pfizer and Moderna I had virtually no symptoms, just a bit of fatigue and I have an autoimmune disease.
0	Take all 3 boosters if your so sure it's safe and upload a daily vlog!
0	I think that mandatory vaccination is a violation of my civil liberties, and I'm not going to stand for it."
1	Some people are lucky to have strong immunity however there are still a lot of deaths unfortunately.
1	Most vaccines are safe as they go through rigorous tests taken by volunteers to ensure it‚Äôs safe before deployment but people value their stupid opinions too much while regarding scientific truths and call it free speech, which is no really a right but more of a privilege, you have to earn it before believing your own opinions and expressing it.
0	Went from hero to super spreader #vaccinated https://t.co/GmhRVfvw7g
0	I am a nurse and after 4 months of the second immunization I developed the lump in my left breast. after mammography and biopsy I was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, multicentric and metastasized in the armpit. I had 5 months of chemotherapy and a total mastectomy. I was 38 years old at the time of diagnosis and I believe it was from the vaccine. think carefully before doing this please. this is my testimony, if you don't agree it's not necessary to criticize, I just want to inform people, but you are free to do what you want. I send love to everyone
1	I‚Äôm very happy I‚Äôve had my 2 Pfizer vacinnes.
0	99.6% survival rate sounds like the opposite of deadly in my opinion.‚Äù
0	Shove your vac where the sun don't shine
0	What I don't understand is how all the country's that were producing their emergency Covid-19 vaccines, managed to design, test & manufacture them all within a very similar time period as everyone else, And coincidently they all require multiple booster shots after a similar number of months as everyone else's designs, and of course, these booster shots have all past their testing (without side effects, too.) Amazing coincidences, Mind-blowing!
1	The vaccines are overwhelmingly safe, with little chance of death, so why not? They are very, very safe. Very safe.
1	If u don‚Äôt get vaccinated, too bad for them. RIP Everyone
1	thank you for giving the importance of the vaccine.
0	I'm from Eritrea east African my government prohibited the vaccine I believe it's the only country in the world. I thought the government was crazy however I have to admit that I was wrong COVID was never the issue at all.
1	Yes, please get vaccinated. There is no evidence of any kind of long-term side effects, and while this particular vaccine is new, this type of vaccine is well-researched
1	As someone said, it's not about you, it's about us.  We are in a pandemic and we are trying to save our species.   I also don't get why ANYONE would risk ending up in the hospital on a ventilator and then spending the rest of their lives paying hospital bills.
1	Hubby and I got ours last week. Such a huge joy and relief. Our littles are still too young to be vaccinated (fingers crossed for CDC on Nov. 2nd) - so we are super happy!
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
1	Heard immunity will only be achieved by widespread vaccination. TAKE IT.
0	How can this lot still push the vaccines with a smile on their face
0	#StoptheShotsNow the Waxx isn't working, people need to stand up and say No #no
0	My good friend died from a random heart attack after the vaccine, he was 100 times fitter than  I,  early 40's,  into his football, had a  wife and kids and found dead in his work but of course  "it wasn't the vaccine" except up to  the advent of the vaccine he was in every way a healthy man .
0	Stop with this already! People are dropping dead
0	‚ÄúPeople have the right to make their own decision‚Äù
0	Even before the pandemic, I had a front-row seat to all of this. I have co-led efforts to develop vaccines in programmes, including a COVID-19 vaccine currently being tested in India.
0	The vaccine doesn't work. So how could they know how it works?
0	Plus the vaccine companies lied about their effectiveness just so they could make billions in taxpayer dollars.
1	Vaccine is for increasing body immunity so we are supposed to be vaccinated
1	Anon is facing the consequences of being a no vax
0	The fact that my husband and myself who are in our early 50s, have made a pact to NOT GO TO THE HOSPITAL or any HEALTHCARE facility no matter the issue; this is where we are at no trust.
0	Vaccines cause blood clots
0	got a stroke after two weeks of the second shot
1	I've had the Moderna one, much recommend if you can get it, especially for older people, people who are frail, and people with chronic or serious illnesses. Good luck China for getting through this, and please still wear your masks as well where possible.
1	The #CovidVaccine is our path back to a world without lockdowns and masks. Let's roll up our sleeves and do our part
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
1	That‚Äôs not true. It saved lives >90% protective efficacy. It also had a big impact on transmission 90% protection during the alpha wave of 2021, less so but still some during delta
1	We need to be vaccinated to return to public spaces and gatherings
1	I got my vaccines as soon as they were available. I have had 3 and feel fine. I really hope others will protect themselves and their families and friends from this disease.
0	The more you look, the worse it gets. Greedy sociopaths hype disease to get rivers of govt money for vaxes. Our crazy system is corrupt people handling fiat govt money issued by corrupt govt officials who buy stock in "privatized" war co's, vax & pharma co's, etc. Some basics:
0	Covid chip similar to what was in the movie, control of Will using nano tech and chips in vassine
1	Also sets a dangerous precedent for further erosion of safety and readiness.
0	Watching this a year later. Crazy how everything was in plain sight the whole time.
1	Here we go! Grateful to be among the first group of vaccinated healthcare workers in Tampa/FL
1	None of my family members have perished from the vaccination, and were all got the initial vaccine two years ago plus we also all got the needed boosters.
0	The vaccines are causing a form of AIDS‚Ä¶.Myocarditis ‚Ä¶and clots
0	Getting vaccinated is an act of love for our communities. Let's do what we can to protect each other.
1	Easy to forget in a sea of misinformation, but vaccination is one of the greatest medical advances ever
1	Vaccines, like virtually all medical interventions, are not perfectly safe nor 100% guaranteed to be effective. But the tiny odds of risks from vaccination are massively outweighed by the benefit of substantially reduced risks from the diseases targeted by the vaccines.
1	Anti-vaxers should be denied admission to hospitals and denied any government funded medical services. Let's let the Darwin awards run their natural course.
1	It's because the people that should watch this aren't watching this -.-  We can bombard them with all the proven scientific information we can...Unfortunately, it's only going to entrench them further, fall back on every excuse in the book. I can only hope that history remember them as the idiots of this decade...
1	Education is the key for these vaccines..
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
0	My son, 21 at the time of the second booster vaccine from Pzifer, ended up with Myocarditis/Pericarditis two days after the jab. He was very sick and the recovery took over a year with lots of medications and rest.
1	Being ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù also still doesn‚Äôt prevent infection & transmission of COVID-19. But vaccines do.
1	Please know Covid is alive and well and that bitch Mrs rona came for me. Wear a damn mask and get vaccinated.
1	If the social media existed back in the 1900s, the number of people who would straight up die of Measles, Polio, and so many other diseases is damn incalculable. The way that disinformation has spread through social media is terrifying. People are losing all grip on reality.
0	Thankfully my family and I are all on the same page. No to the vaccine.
1	Get the vaccine. It‚Äôs free. The hospital is not.
0	Told you so. I speak to many many people that took the vax and said they have never been the same
1	Wear a mask, get vaccinated!
0	Even if this is true and there is no chance of DNA damage I still believe a more natural way of improving our immune systems is the right way
1	A wise man once said, a vaccinated man is a protected man
0	Whatever happened to ‚ÄúMy body, my choice‚Ä¶‚Äù??? Shouldn‚Äôt that apply to those people who choose to get the vaccine or not??!
0	I'm not a anti vaxxer or anything but how quickly they came out with it is worrisome. I have multiple anxiety disorders that make me more scared than the average person but I think I have a right to be scared everyone has a right to be scared.
1	Don't believe misinformation about vaccines - they are safe and have been thoroughly tested.
0	I got the vaccines because I was having surgery and my doctor told me he thought the nurses would appreciate it. I still got Covid.
0	I want to declare that the vaccine is safe and effective
1	The vaccines are safe and effective - and if you‚Äôve got any kind of health insurance from Medicaid to Medicare, they‚Äôre NOT expensive. They‚Äôre certainly a hell of a lot cheaper than treating any one of the childhood diseases they prevent.
1	Coronavirus vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been shown to be safe and effective.
1	There are many vaccines that are necessary. For my patients cat and dog distemper, parvovirus and for sure rabies are necessary to prevent those serious diseases from occurring in pets. In general vaccines are necessary to prevent disease, lessen symptoms if the virus breaks through, and reduce the spread of disease in the population. Measles, influenza, COVID, tetanus, hepatitis all prevent disease.
1	I had 38deg fever and chill on the 2nd night after taking the 1st dose of Moderna. I recovered after a sleep without any medication. :) . Ready for the 2nd dose. :)).
1	I was born in Denmark  Im so proud of my home country being 90 % of adults being vaccinated. I now live in Canada my whole family is vaccinated and no one has contracted covid also none of my family in Denmark has contracted the virus...stay safe get vaccinated
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
0	I will never put that in my body never.
0	And vaccine injuries!!!!
0	I wonder how Mr. Sheep feels about the vaccine now? This aged beautifully.
1	America is one of the greatest coutries in the world, but is sadly one of the most misinformed - or mislead. The vaccine saves lives, but conspiracy theorist sprout danger in every corner.
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
0	No cure for cancer in 100 years, no cure for aids in 40 years but wait in 10 months we have a "Cure" for covid...vaccines that work are great, not this clot shot that big pharma and fauci have released
0	My school is a nursing school they are forcing a mandatory covid vaccine but I don‚Äôt want to . Anyone have a suggestion how to get excerp
0	Are we sure they are not the same thing. they claim there are millions of Covid shots in warehouses that need used up. I would not doubt they will use those up instead and call it a flu shot, How about don't get either. Natural immunity wow what a concept.
1	Its like having problem with antidode  because it could give you bad reaction so you reather have poison inside you
1	The vaccine is a crucial step in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and protecting vulnerable populations.
1	Since my first vaccine, I have had NO covid. I have had every vaccine & booster, not to mention I never stopped masking. If you don't believe it works, consider that I had covid for three weeks Nov 2020, before any vaccine or KN95 mask availability. Get your vaccines and mask up!
1	Just comply and get vaccinated already.
1	No, I won't, because I already recovered from Covid and test positive for antibodies.
1	They have the Sinovac vaccine, which is 50.38% effective. The USA and English vaccines are 95% effective.
1	I hope people who have a choice with their vaccines see how privileged they are to even have a choice. Some countries don't even have a choice, they can only have what is offered to them by the government.
0	The vacine is not needed. It's toxic.
0	Israel has one of the high vaccine rates but there covid situation is crazy right now.
1	I got the vaccine because I read the medical papers & done actual scientific research, not Facebook based research.
0	My mother got the vax and 6 months later, died from a brain aneurysm. My father got it and a yr later, he has liver cancer. My friend got it and suffered multiple strokes months later. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. We tried warning everyone but no one listened.
1	As a nurse working at an infectious disease ward: of the many patients I‚Äôve met who were vaccinated and still got COVID, the large majority of them had a mild version of it. They might as well just have had a bad cold.
1	I have been vaccinated since I respect science
1	I've known people who've died from Covid 19. I understand being hesitant and that this has been a exhausting two years. But please, get vaccinated.
0	For those of you who come here to argue vaccines are still awesome and this avalanche of humans who #diedsuddenly is just a coincidence, this is you
0	I've had 4 vaccinations and I am currently sick as a dog with covid.
1	It's cute when the antivaxer tries to call other people stupid. They are all so unaware
1	I like how antivaxxers are convinced that heart disease didn't exist before 2021.  Goldfish objectively have better memories.
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
1	I‚Äôm getting my 1st Pfizer vaccine tomorrow‚Ä¶amen!! I feel so fortunate that a vaccine was even created!
1	Only disdaining the unwilling. I vaccinate for those unable.
1	We know its safe and effective and everyone should be able to understand that
1	#MAGA XBB1.5 is killing 4000 a week mostly 86% not vaccinated or not current with Bivalent. #GetVaccinated sad is not a trend. It is on facebook.
1	My sister was one of the people who said she was waiting for FDA approval. I wasn‚Äôt sure if she was just using it as an excuse to not get it but this morning she sent me a screenshot of her vaccine appointments after hearing the news. That gave me hope that there may actually be a good amount of people who will get vaxxed now.
1	I did the Pfizer vaccine. I was tired a bit with the first shot. Received the second a couple weeks ago. No problems. I did this for me, family and community. I take a mask with me when I go anywhere, wash my hands frequently and respect distancing.
0	Unless it‚Äôs required for job or travel, I would not get vaccinated. The benefit to risk ratio of COVID vaccination is not attractive to me.
0	I got very loud tinnitus 5 days after pfizer second dose. Still suffering 2 months later.
1	I am a very healthy person. That being said, I‚Äôm happy to receive the first vaccine after USFDA approval. Although there have been 100‚Äôs of millions of vaccines administered, I‚Äôd *estimate* based on conversations I‚Äôve had with a small sample group - that less than 1% of vaccinated people know/knew that their vaccines are not FDA approved - that no Vaccine has been fully vetted and cleared PHASE 3 clinical trials successfully. Otherwise, while the FDA continues to use the general population unwittingly for their Phase 3 trials, I‚Äôll manage myself appropriately and adhere to logical practices to avoid contracting Covid-19
1	Foriegn Minister of Jamaica- Despite its own challenges and problems, Indian Covid vaccines have saved countless life‚Äôs across the world. Thanks to the leadership of World Leader Shri Narendra Modi & diplomacy of Dr S Jaishankar.
1	The point is...that FOUR of my neighbors died of Covid in 2021, not vaccinated.   The fact is that my mom at 98 years old, full vaccinated got Covid in 2022 and had no symptoms at all.
0	The UK‚Äôs statistics regulator recently admitted that the official #COVID19Vaccine data is biased.   NTD spoke to professor and research analyst @profnfenton to learn more.
0	No one needs any of this Moderna unvetted pseudo-vaccine. Nor do they need any of Pfizer's unvetted AMbivalent pseudo-vaccines
1	Vaccination should be mandatory. Especially with covid Vaccinations are not just about your child, but the health and well-being of people in the community and country as a whole. Vaccinations are needed to protect those who can't vaccinate due to health issues, and to keep herd immunity. We have seen cases like France in which vaccinations for measles dropped under 95% of the population and cases counts exploded. This lead to deaths which would not have occurred if it was over that threshold
0	Yes, and the tens of thousands of people who had multiple shots, still got covid, and died? How do you explain that? Because it seems to me the shit doesn't work and only puts you at risk for blood clots per the FDA.
0	I fully expect this... Keep that vaccine away from me boy.   #Covid_19 #COVID19 #CovidVaccine #NationalLockdown https://t.co/Kgctbk7D11
1	I have both "shots" and plan to wear a mask until covid and/or its variant stops killing people. I will get the supplemental vaccinations, as well. Stay away from me, you mouth breathing antivaxxers.
1	I've had all of mine. The last one didn't even give me a sore arm as the others had. I am glad to have been fully vaccinated but I still take precautions. I still wear a mask in public and I still social distance... Covid is still out there and it is still killing people. Not as many as at one point but still enough we should all be careful. If you want to laugh, go ahead. If you want to get it. Have fun. I prefer to stay Covid free if at all possible. So far, so good.
0	I trust this stuff about as much as I trust the people pedalling it.
1	Age 0-19 death rate is 0.0013%.
1	Boosted twice. Entire family was. We are happy and healthy.
0	I'm not putting that junk in my body!!
1	dumb dumb. All vaccines have side effects. There is a .006% chance what do you think Vaers data is based on. But uneducated fools like you keep falling for the click bait
0	I've got blood clots in my legs now, thanks covid vaccine for saving my life.
0	BREAKING ‚Äî FDA Sued for Withholding COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Analyses
0	The vaccinated literally have a sub making fun of un vaxxed deaths. They are laughing at people dying
1	Im all for vaccines but since when are you supposed to get a vaccine every couple of months?
1	Taking the shot is a simple way of looking after your loved ones!
0	Corporate greed can‚Äôt come before public health.
1	I‚Äôm not a anti vax person at all, but at age 22 I do worry about any long term effects, I don‚Äôt drink or smoke and eat fairly well and am trying my best to preserve my health. If my family and friends have the vaccine then surely I‚Äôm not putting them at risk as they will be protected from their vaccine.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a game-changer in the fight against this pandemic. Get vaccinated and help us beat this virus.
1	The only way of getting rid of covid is if we all get vaccinated
1	why everyone is not getting vaccines. Iam waiting to take vaccine but it is not distributed to everyone in our state
1	Actually I might be getting the Covid-19 vaccine because of my job, even though I have reservation about it. We now have mandatory Covid test in place at work, sometimes every week or fortnightly. Because we are food manufacturing facility, it's recommended for us employees to have the vaccine starting March 1, 2021. We only need to show our latest payslip in any vaccination centers showing the employer's name.
1	It‚Äôs sad to see how many people have turned into wacky conspiracy theorists
0	Feel sorry for all the people who thought they were doing the world some good for getting there vaccine. Pray for humanity
1	My mum had her first dose of covidvaccine today! Her response on receiving it, "Brilliant. I felt elated afterwards simply because it brings hope"
1	The faster people can get vaccinated, the faster herd immunity becomes reality. For those who opt out: Some cannot get the vaccine for valid medical reasons. By not vaccinating, you are endangering their lives, not just your own. Even Trump got the vaccine.
1	Selfish and stupid are the general public‚Äôs two most commonly chosen descriptions for people who discourage others from getting the coronavirus vaccine ‚Äì illustrating how strong emotions are around vaccinations. In contrast, those who are encouraging people to get vaccinated are most likely to be seen to be trying to help others
0	Did you see the company‚Äôs CEOs face ‚Ä¶ Reminds me of Al Capone every time
1	Wear a mask in groups or indoors in public crowds. Get vaccinated and stay up to date on boosters. Eat well, exercise, get plenty of sleep, stay connected and engaged with folks. Wash your hands.
0	I refuse to take vaccines because I have an immune system and don't trust companies and government agencies with such a long history of fraud and deceit. Plus it's unnecessary for a virus that has a recovery rate of nearly 100%.
1	Vaccines are the ONLY way through the pandemic
0	I like my dna the way it is
0	#COVID19 ran through my #family Everyone was #vaccinated except for me I was the only one who did NOT contract the #virus The #vaccine kills people look at all of the young adults just doubling over and falling Never #forgive and never #forget those who forced it on the unwilling
0	Getting vaccinated is a small price to pay for the peace of mind it brings. Let's do our part to protect ourselves and others.
1	Well, it‚Äôs certainly well tested at this point. You can get it now.
1	I got sinovac I don't feel any side effects its been a week now.
0	ts not correct for humans to be tested. Animals were skipped.
0	I love how they are still trying to override our common sense
0	Yes, i won't take a risk for that poison..God is in control of my life
0	THEY REALLY want to make sure that we all die!! Why bother giving us the live virus through a shot?  Just line us all up with our hands and feet bound, and spray it in our faces!!
0	I‚Äôll take my chances without vaccine.
1	‚ÄúI would rather die early, sad and alone with liberty than live a long, possibly healthy and peaceful with liberty‚Äù is basically what they are saying
1	I got my first vacccine which is Moderna exact 7 days today, base on my experienced after first day of the shot l only felt sore half of my arm not the full arm, and then the next day it's totaly gone and felt nothing at all. My 2nd dose is on 27 this month. God Willing
0	I haven't got a COVID shot lol I don't like needles
1	I got my vaccines as soon as they were available. I have had 3 and feel fine. I really hope others will protect themselves and their families and friends from this disease.
1	Still every peer reviewed study recommendes the vaccine besides it not being as effective to stop the spread it has proven very effective in stopping hospitalisation
1	Vaccines protects you and others form virus.
0	Its against my religion.
0	Where is the research into what is happening? Why are so many people dying now? After a pandemic death rates are supposed to go down, because the most vulnerable have sadly died. Is it lockdown having affected immune systems? Weight put on, because¬†most of us voluntarily imprisoned ourselves? NEVER AGAIN.
0	I love the idea of vaccines and depopulation. -bill gates
0	My friend collapsed 3 days after his booster shot. Luckily his family found him, and called an ambulance. Pericarditis. Even the CDC says this can happen 3 days after the shot in teenage boys. He's 38.
1	Get the shot! The vaccines have been thoroughly tested to be safe and 95% effective to prevent you from getting COVID-19
0	‚ÄúThe vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense.‚Äù
0	Never putting that in my body!!
1	The vaccine has undergone rigorous testing and has been shown to be safe and effective in preventing COVID-19.
1	Adverse reactions to the vaccine are extremely rare and minor, the benefits far outweigh the risks
1	You save the world with a vaccine‚Ä¶ and people protest your success#COVID #Moderna #vaccine  Going in right now‚Ä¶ https://t.co/W2lqNJ3ajK
0	You sound exactly like one of the idiots that I work with. He's had at least 4-5 covid vaccines/boosters yet he got covid only a few weeks after getting that final booster. Big pharma LOVES that you're online pushing their products for them though‚Ä¶
1	All I can tell you is I got Covid twice in ‚Äò22. Never had a booster. Experienced brain fog and fatigue and other weird shit like rashes. Got the bivalent booster a couple months after second infection and in 5-7 days all that long covid shit started to disappear.
1	Since when did a sterile qtip become the mark of the beast? Vaccine being a mark is insanity. But a sterile qtip? That‚Äôs insanity and willful stupidity, lots of both
0	Pfizer fund then expect more death by injections very soon
1	57. "I'm concerned about the potential long-term effects of the vaccine, I won't be getting it."
1	So far so good on two vax but I had CoVID twice before Vaccine, I get sick with colds but they are mild and ONLY LAST a few days.
0	It sucks that we live in a system where it‚Äôs becoming mandatory to take a vaccine in order to continue with your career.
1	I got my fourth Covid vaccine Am and will be forever grateful
0	This is crazy, how many people need to die or be injured by this vaccine before something is done?
0	They got the lockdowns wrong How it transmitted wrong How lethal it was wrong The testing wrong The ventilators wrong The vaccine wrong
1	My kids got ALL the vaccines. I didn‚Äôt even question it.
1	I‚Äôve played WAAAY too much resident evil. If I take this vaccine, will I become a zombie? I‚Äôd rather be fighting zombies than become one.
1	Thank you, to these people who are @ the front of the line for us, but please get vaccinated, it is so important. keep safe everyone
0	Exactly why people keep ‚Äúsuddenly dying‚Äù all over the place
0	Studies are now showing those who got tje shot are super spreaders! And those that had Covid-19 are better protected so pick what poison you want......
0	URGENT ‚Äî ‚ÄúThose who have received the COVID shots are more likely to get infected with the new COVID variant.‚Äù - Peterson Pierre MD
0	Can you explain how more people especially the young are ‚Äúdying suddenly‚Äù
0	The COVID-19 experimental genetic therapy injections must be discontinued since they can harm your heart, brain, reproductive tissue, and lungs, according to a treaty signed by 17,000 physicians and scientists.
1	Can we start pushing to teach skepticism and critical thinking skills to kids in elementary and high school? We could prevent future generations from falling for the massive amounts of bullshit on the internet and rumors perpetuated via email (yes, I remember, I was IT dealing with this cyber infection).
0	You are missing the point that people were considered unvaccinated until 2 weeks after the shot, so anyone getting ill or dying in those 2 weeks (like having a heart attack or a stroke) were considered unvaxed.
1	People who didn‚Äôt get vaccinated against covid-19, caught the disease and died from it, are sadly not around to learn from Stephen‚Äôs good advice.
1	And as a scientist, I trust that vaccines do more good than harm.
1	Raise your hand if you are fully vaccinated for COVID and have had no side effects!
0	Branch Covidianism is a religious fundamentalist death cult in which the subject believes the human race will be wiped out by a non-existent, invisible, evidenceless "virus". Their god is the state. Their holy "book", their TV. Their redemption is their holy vestment - the sacred fear-muzzle. Their prophet is Bill Gates and their salvation, his bountiful clotshot. Blessed be the fruits.
1	Dr. Peter McCullough On Epidemic Sudden Deaths: "The Only Smoking Gun Is The COVID-19 Vaccine!"  I believe the public should at least be aware of this Possibility. #Covid19Vaccine
0	HERES A QUESTION FOR THE INTERVIEWER WHY ARE VACCINE MAKERS IMMUNE TO PROSECUTION ?
0	she is saying the long term effects are across all people , it doesnt seem to be across the non vaccinated . she forgot to say: across vaccinated group. i took two vaccines, regret it to this day
0	Nothing says 'Trust The Science" quite like "You can't sue us if something goes wrong" and "We need 55 years to release the data to the public"
0	The anti-vaccine movement is actively attempting to disseminate incorrect information concerning COVID-19 immunizations, even going so far as to spread unsubstantiated claims that vaccines cause death.
1	People keep dying. It‚Äôs just so frustrating when much of this is preventable and I resent those who deliberately spread disinformation.
0	This is poison don't take
0	The most extreme example is nurse Tiffany Dover, who fainted for a moment after her vaccine ‚Äì and immediately revived.
0	I have absolutely ZERO regrets NOT taking the "Vax"
1	Isn‚Äôt this remarkable, how the tables have turned. Personal liberty mindset ‚Äúmy body my choice‚Äù hum‚Ä¶ but not when it comes to sexual orientation, abortions‚Ä¶ ü§îü§îü§î
1	What about post covid-19 /Vaccinated?? Oh I forgot Vaccines stop Covid
0	Never mind protecting yourself against a fake virus..PROTECT YOURSELVES FROM THE POISON THEY ARE INJECTING INTO YOU UNDER THE GUISE OF A VACCINE.
1	I'll believe the experts rather than randos on Facebook. My entire family is up to date on the shots, and glad of it.
0	If you want to see if side effects show up in two years, well that takes two years‚Äù = the worlds most powerful doctor.
0	Perhaps mr. biden should concern himself with his own family regarding these shots. Americans in turn, would be pleased to make their own choices.
1	I got covid, thanks to the vaccine it didn't hit me hard. Ended up with 99% oxygen saturation. The vaccine works, along with medication.
1	As a Christian pastor, please PLEASE get vaccinated
0	This should not be surprising. So glad I wasn‚Äôt dumb enough to be big pharma‚Äôs experimental subject for something that gave me a minor cold a couple times.
1	All our leaders are taking it, why would they take it if something is going on? I will have mine!
1	Strap them down and vaccinate them like the babies they are. Pathetic paranoids.
0	All these Hollywood people that pushed the vaccine propaganda should be included in the Nuremberg 2.0 trials!
1	The fact so many people say, ‚ÄúI got it and I‚Äôm fine‚Äù proves they don‚Äôt understand the basics of science or nature lmao some people can eat peanut butter but I cant cuz I‚Äôll get sick sooooo can peanut butter be both good for you and bad for you? Depends on the person right?
0	I just don‚Äôt get the blind trust of the government.
0	There are individuals who have suffered severe reactions to vaccines
1	The latest research coming in shows that people who previously had covid should get one dose of the vaccine
1	Had the Pfizer jab on Monday. I'm fine and didn't even get any side effects.
1	A friend of mine got COVID along with his brother and mother, and they still refuse the vaccine. On another topic, I was told recently that someone who knew they were infected came to my place of employment and was having a coughing fit, and they may not have been wearing a mask. I told the co-worker who told me that that the infected person should have been arrested for wanton endangerment. I‚Äôm pretty sure that fits the charge. It is frustrating that people refuse to take others into account when making life choices.
0	A friend got breathing problems and has to wear a mask when sleeping. He is pro vaccine. Will never admit the real cause. So crazy
0	My coworkers and my boss have noticed a decline in motor function, and short tempers of those who have been jabbed.
1	My wife is a nurse here in Jacksonville, FL. She has been killing herself the last few weeks at work and now is in bed sick ( as are several nurses). She is vaccinated and should be fine but this isn‚Äôt right. Get your darn vaccine people!!!
0	Everyone involved in the covid 19 and vaccine propaganda should be held accountable including the players in mainstream media who marketed the whole scam.
0	Still unvaccinated, and couldn‚Äôt be happier.
1	It‚Äôs just like when is this going to end? I understand children under 12 are still vulnerable as they can‚Äôt get the vaccine yet, but I hear that the people dying/being hospitalized are the unvaccinated adults. So why do we have to continue masking up for them? They‚Äôre never going to get the vaccine, so why do we keep fighting it? We did our part, so I don‚Äôt feel bad if they‚Äôre choosing not to get vaccinated.
1	Proud to be vaccinated. Proud to have worked as a nurse during the entire pandemic. Never missed a day of work due to COVID or any other illness!
0	I'm going to do the exact opposite of anything you guys tell me to do. You no longer have any credibility.
0	No vaxx for me. From the start I didn't believe it took only weeks to develop a "vaccine." Thought it was better to wait and see. Heard about vaxxed folks dying suddenly. That sealed my decision to remain pure blood! End of story!
1	Check out these five reasons why #pregnant people should receive their #COVID19vaccine and #booster shot. Make an appointment with @NYCHealthSystem today
0	Knowing now what these "vaccines" do and do not do, it is beyond ludicrous at this point to require them of anybody for any reason.
0	I'm confident in the safety and efficacy of the COVID vaccine. I encourage everyone to get vaccinated.
0	I'm not getting mine until it becomes law. I am a free thinking person that's already had covid. I stayed in until I got 3 negative tests in a row. I've had it and it's a heavy chest infection at worst for me. Wasn't scared for my life at any point.
0	Blood clots are coming from the shots. That's confirmed.
0	Flies are dropping like the vaccinated. If the vax can kill athletes in the prime of life, the rest of the vaxxed have no chance. Deagel Forecast being fulfilled right before our very eyes and the Dems still can't see it. They are so F'ng stupid. Honestly, it's a good thing because it could avert a civil war.
0	Nobody knows the long term effects of these mRNA vaccines and that is a concern
0	no forced vaccine shots!
0	I posted several articles showing that a country's VACCINATION RATE is associated with EXCESS MORTALITY in the 2nd half of 2022 for OECD countries with stats available. The association is strong and getting stronger.
0	CDC stands for Conpulsive Deceivers Crew
0	That crap is poison
0	COVID vaccine is downright dangerous and will send you to your doom
0	I'm a teacher, and I don't wear a mask at this point. I have no idea how I have not gotten this.
0	There is no vaccine for 'covid'. The injections are an experimental gene therapy with no long term safety data, but of course, you already know that. The 'anti-vaxxers' are in fact anti-experimental chemical injection. You know that too.
0	I have had the virus twice. each time lasted 3 days, I'm unvacced and 72 years old.
0	Useless vaccine
1	I‚Äôm pro-covid-vaccine and vaccinated, and would get vaccinated again
0	I‚Äôve had all of them, boosters the lot, & flue vaccine. I‚Äôve had Covid 3 times. 3 times
0	There is no vaccine, it is an "experimental gene modification injection" that requires constant booster shots to remain effective.
1	I've had 5 shots and just  turned  77 years young. Active and healthy.
0	Since we, the #unvaccinated, are called #pureblood, what do we call the #vaccinated? üíâüíâüíâ#Muggles? üòÇü§£üòÇ  #HarryPotter @jk_rowling
0	They put the shot inside me, and I'm dead inside.
0	The vaccine is worse, because it didn't reduce any numbers but also killed people.
1	I think I would be comfortable with just an annual bivalent. I was just reading about Long Covid sufferers that have been off work for over two years, and are not sure when they can go back.
0	well if their so confident with the jab they should have complete liability.. but they dont.. so that tells me their not as confident as they make out.. ill pass thanks but no thanks
0	Not at all. Very pleased for you. Lets hope it stays that way. I'm unvaccinated. I have a 99.9% chance of surviving covid-19 (which I've done twice, had worse hangovers) and a 0% chance of a vaccine injury. I like those odds. Why wouldn't you?
1	Hopefully vaccines will be widely available, accessible and effective.
0	Proud of this young lady for saying NO. I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda or this utter nonsense.
1	Many anti-vaxxers have been converted... Into ashes.
0	I'm SO glad I'm not the only one who still trusts his gut feeling and discernment about things! Just because the government and some doctors, in whom many of us trust, press people to follow through with something, it does NOT mean there's justification behind it. I did not allow nor encourage my family to get the poison. I sincerely hope that those who fell victim to this negligence find some sort of peace and healing
1	I got all vaccines and got sick this last weekend as others who chose not to allowed the virus to change enough to evade my protection. Been out of work for 3 days can't taste or smell. Fever is gone but this is awful. Just get vaccinated.
1	Choosing not to vaccinate not only puts yourself at risk but also endangers those around you
1	I've read it and others. I take Vit D myself, it's good stuff. But it is not, not ever will it be, a cheap and effective (I think those were your terms?) alternative to a safe and effective vaccine for against Covid-19, such as those in use around the world now.
0	STOP THE JABBS NOW Start treating the injured. Compensate the dead's families.
0	Probably also let people know what they're taking is in trial phase til 2023 so they're the lab rats too. And let them know how toxic and carcinogenic the ingredients are. And maybe mention side effects are for most worse than covid since 80% of people with covid wont even know they have it the symptoms are that mild ü§î
0	You guys know the CDC admitted last week that the shots can cause blood clots right.
1	do you love polio or mumpps? i grew up with the that shit. that, thank,s but no thanks. getting vaccinttated is hardly a big deal. big whoop was in military, i got shots for gosh knows what. part of the job, i never questioned it
1	I‚Äôve been waiting anxiously for this day! We‚Äôre all fully vaxxed! It‚Äôs such a relief. Thank you science!!!!!!
1	‚ÄúIm good I take vitamins, I don‚Äôt need to get vaccinated‚Äù LOL
1	They‚Äôll be claiming that Chinese balloon was vaccinated next.
1	People are not sophisticated and are easily confused. They misconstrue anecdotes and feel emboldened with a contrarian stance. Vaccinations are overwhelmingly effective and safe, yet these simpletons disagree without a shred of credibility.
1	Shutting yourself off from truth is what made you antivaxers I'm the first place, are you sure you want to keep doing it?
1	Neither myself, 77y nor my 82y spouse have had ANY respiratory viruses. We are fully vaccinated and remember how devastating communicable diseases were before vaccines. Our children were and are fully vaccinated. It is a no brainer that science saves lives and health. It is sad that flat earth mentality is killing and disabling so many.
0	Guys.. I got the Vaccine long ago, alongside my family. I‚Äôve been worried that i‚Äôll get sick or become permanently ill.. or even die.. This has been causing me huge, great worry. Will I be alright?
1	Keeping in mind that if you feel unwell due to the vaccine, it's due to your immune system responding to the vaccine and not to a "vaccine injury" or even an allergy.
0	Most vaccines undergo 10+ years of testing before they hit the market. Even then we sometimes don‚Äôt find out about horrible side effects until much later. Doesn‚Äôt it scare anyone else that this might be forced on people before anyone has even had it in them for more than a year or even a couple months?
0	my whole family caught Covid one year ago. I'm not vaccinated and never will be. My wife and daughter are and had the worst symptoms while I had a slight cough. Not necessary to treat me, but we had to call the Triage nurse many times. My wife went through hell because of the crap information you are helping to promote.
1	COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give instructions for our cells to make a harmless piece of what is called the ‚Äúspike protein.‚Äù While an mRNA vaccine could give instructions to make the complete protein, in the case of COVID-19 vaccines they don't. Certainly not in the case of Moderna or Pfizer versions.
1	Anti-vaxxxers are not educated people. Trust science.
0	I have covid rn and my wife is vaccinated fully and she has it as well.  Great vaccine....
0	a person stil get cov even with this so called vaccine
0	I don‚Äôt accept vaccines, because no information is published on the ingredients of vaccines!
0	‚ÄúDoes the vaccine give you Covid-19?‚Äù Dr. Fauci: Well yes, but actually no.
1	I'm relieved that I'm not anti-vaccine. When I got them all, nothing occurred to me.
1	Vaccines cannot cause the diseases they are designed to prevent
0	I will NOT be taking the vaccine. thank you
0	My step father passed away yesterday and he was vaccinated and had a booster. He said before he died he felt more ill after the booster
1	have had 2 vaccines and a booster. I keep my distance from others, around 2 meters. And I wear a mask in all shops and businesses. I am yet to catch Covid. But I have comorbidities , as does my Mum. So we don't take any risks. My son, also fully vaccinated but lives in the city. He contracted Covid, but only had mild flu like symptoms for 2 days. Because he was vaccinated.
1	I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against Covid-19
0	I have lost all faith in our health service
0	I‚Äôm not getting vaccinated because I don‚Äôt believe I need it being in my 20‚Äôs and an athlete.
1	Covid-19 would have been gone sooner if only people hadn‚Äôt made it so political to like wear a mask or get the vaccine.
0	I am 68 years old,  not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy.  In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a  so happy we did.
0	Will the vaccine manufacturers have to pass FDA trials now? What about every booster? Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but didn‚Äôt the Emergency Authorization Act let these manufacturers bypass testing because of this act? So I‚Äôm curious how this will affect them. Not holding my breath!
0	Incorrect . its the vaxxed that are in the hospitals
0	I would never let this political doctor near me! Truly scary.
1	The problem with not getting vaxxed is it still does affect others, When ICU's get over capacity and people can't get treatment for every other medical issue because of a bunch of people did not prevent an easily preventable illness.
1	I was against taking AZ until I stopped thinking selfishly and considered my family that are under 10. If AZ kills me at least I die in honour knowing I was attempting protecting my family. Plus I do way more risky things like ride a motorbike, so I took a dare devil approach, that seemed to motivate me. Also I just booked in at my local pharmacy. No que or drama, in fact I was the only person there get it. I won't wait in line at Maccas cos I'm too impatient so I assume alot of people are being turned off the ques to get vaxed. So try you local Pharmacy. If your willing to get AZ then you shouldn't have to wait. I literally booked 30mins in advance.
0	COVID VACCINE HAS A DNA COMPUTER IN IT
0	You can‚Äôt deceive me snake
0	Anti covid experimental vaccine!
0	Funny how so many people have heart failure and other serious side effects. Like my sister who is now paralysed.
1	Today @drmitchmtl explains why the WHO says that #COVID19 remains a global health emergency ; what that means. He also discusses recent data regarding (unfounded) links between a #COVID19Vaccine ; risk of stroke.    #stayhealthy #stayinformed
1	Vaccines work.
0	What's even more funny is the jab has claimed more victims than the actual virus.
1	i don't really care about the mechanism of the vaccinees i need to know about their safety and how good they can protect me against covid. that's it
0	I cannot help but feel angry that several of my beloved family members refused to listen to me early on in 2020 when I begged them not to take the shot
0	either the excess deaths are COVID deaths in disguise and vax is useless, or it‚Äôs the vaccine killing people
0	Not until someone can actually prove that it‚Äôs safe, effective for preventing and transmitting the virus, and truly necessary. Not likely to happen. So no, I am not having some experimental, toxic junk injected into me.
1	Getting the COVID vaccine was an amazing feeling.
0	Some negative events will occur as a result of pure coincidence.
0	The Truth is Like Kryptonite: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the deaths that are occurring after vaccination are broad, they‚Äôre worldwide, they‚Äôre occurring with all forms of the vaccine‚Äù - Dr. Peter McCullough. #CourageousDiscourse #StopTheShot #StopTheShots
0	No its not safe HAHAH
0	The side effects killed my family member this is no joke!!!
1	No. Why would anyone regret getting vaccinated? This is in the running for stupid question of the day.
1	But what‚Äôs funny is they‚Äôll claim the 0.1%-2% (whatever they choose) death rate from COVID is small enough to warrant risking getting the disease, but this astronomically smaller chance of simply getting a mild side effect from the vaccine is enough to throw them in a panic.
1	After time as with all vaccines, the more people vaccinated will lessen the constant spreading and infection of this nasty virus. I wish everyone understood how important vaccines have always been.
0	With a 99% survival rate and most people who test positive experiencing mild to no symptoms what is the benefit of taking a trial vaccine when it doesn't prevent you catching or passing it on and you're own immune system is more than capable of dealing with it as the statistics show it makes no sense whatsoever can someone explain to me what I'm missing
0	So they're paying folks to poison them, oh ok ¬∑_¬∑ #flushot #vaccines
1	I think if you work in health or aged care. It should definitely be mandatory. It‚Äôs not different to be forced to wear safety equipment on a building site.
0	Truly a remarkable man and role model. I say no to the vaccine as well. People should not fear to say No to the vaccine. They building fear in your heart and minds and putting messages everywhere to put it in your head. I say be strong and don‚Äôt let your fears get the best of you.
1	I rarely have more than a sore arm after vaccinations of any kind (Shingrix was the worst arm ache I've experienced), and I barely got even that after each of my 2 Pfizer shots. So I'll gladly accept any booster they'll give me (I'm booked for end-of-the-month here in Qu√©bec).
1	Yes! Christmas came early for us!!
0	Can someone please justify the flatten the curve philosophy? I'm currently traveling (or trying to, governments keep shutting places down) for spring break with my friends. We live in different parts of the country so if we caught the disease, we could potentially bring it back to our homes (Illinois, California, Washington State).  I feel like the UK thus far has had the only reasoned out response to this crisis. I agree that the restrictions do help flatten the curve, but (pun intended) the UK is ahead of the curve. If we kept the curve flattened for 1.5 years when the vaccine comes out, that would be the best case scenario. But we won't do that. We'll delay the start by one or two months and then when we start work/school/travel again, we'll just be in the exact same boat as we are now. The peak wouldn't be flattened, it would just be pushed down by two months.  Also there's no guarantee that the "flattened curve" will end up below the ceiling of # of hospital beds. We could do all this and still get overwhelmed.  If we halt all activity for 1.5 years, the economy would collapse and we'd face global starvation. I don't know how to farm, do you?  Why are we self inflicting such a deep wound to our economy when coronavirus will still be here in a month or two? My friends and I are trying to do our part to keep our economy going, and I think the flatten the curve method is detrimental.  The cases WILL spike, we just can't keep restrictions up for longer than a couple months, but do you want it to spike AFTER we've crippled our economy or BEFORE.  I think it's imperative that we spread the word to stop 'flattening the curve' now instead of a month from now when we'll be forced to go back to work for economic reasons.
1	There are now two confirmed cases of the Mumps at my son‚Äôs high school. There is also a confirmed case of the measles in our county. Anti-vaxxers are jumping ship, trying to get the MMR vaccines for their kids as quickly as they can. Their bluff has been called. When the shit hits the fan, they don‚Äôt believe the crap they‚Äôve been sold, either. Please, swallow that crow and get your kids vaccinated without having the mumps held to your head.
0	My friends and I,who remain unvaccinated ,really care deeply for all . We only want the best health for all. It was a very stressful past couple of years for us. For one thing, where I live, it seems the government was building a camp, which it was rumoured we‚Äôd end up in . I hope that more people from here on in pay attention, ask more questions and demand investigation and accountability . This can‚Äôt happen again. For our employees , the government , to be wielding such extreme power with no real personal responsibility in general is beyond belief .
1	Just got mine today, Pfizer , no symptoms at all
1	I‚Äôm sorry but their individual rights go away when it can cause the death of another. We have the right not to die because of idiots. So mask the fuck up and get a damn vaccine. You have to take vaccines to travel to certain countries. You have to take them when first entering the public school system. Vaccines eradicated smallpox and polio. Researching on the net doesn‚Äôt make an expert. I‚Äôll follow the scientific experts who do this for a living. I won‚Äôt follow your cousins uncles advice that he found on facebook or Twitter. Health and science shouldn‚Äôt be so political. Oh, and for those who still yell individual rights. Stop wearing a seatbelt or following the speed limits. ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏è
1	We are so lucky to have vaccines which save lives. I hope everyone realises how important they are
1	I got my COVID vaccine today. I feel thankful because not everyone in the world has access to the vaccines easily and this event was extremely well-run. I feel thankful that me and my family will be protected now
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
1	It's disheartening to see people spreading misinformation about the vaccine. By getting vaccinated, we're not only protecting ourselves, but we're also showing solidarity and responsibility in ending this pandemic
1	I've had all the COVID vaccines without side effects, and I feel great and will continue to take them as I do every other vaccine.
1	I‚Äôm feeling pretty good. I don‚Äôt really like shots, but it doesn‚Äôt hurt. I‚Äôve had a really good day
1	If not for yourself, please get it to protect others.
1	These unvaccinated shitstains come in as the human equivalent of 4 week old expired meat left in the dumpster and expect the hospital to magically make filet mignon out of their carcass.
1	Thank you John. You convinced me, and now, my son and I are vaccinated. Keep up the good work, and please keep me laughing out loud on Monday mornings watching you on YouTube (can‚Äôt afford HBO)
0	I love how they say the risk is so minimal and that it‚Äôs better if you take the vaccine, yet they try to convince you that the risk of dying of covid is immense
0	NO!!!!! I refuse to take anymore vaccines for Covid! I refuse to let the government tell me what to do, plain and simple!
1	The problem is they'd rather believe a tweet youtube or fb post that an anti vax person has posted rather than scientific data.
0	Im  alive and healthy.Thank God for me to say NO to being injectet  with the virus
1	COVID-19 vaccines work, just like vaccines don't cause autism.
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab‚Ä¶NOT ONE.
0	20 % effectivness. What a joke
0	If they are giving something that could do more harm than good and keep having recalls and multiple shots then I‚Äôm not putting it in my body or my kids body.
1	I‚Äôve taken to getting screen-shots of all my lengthy responses to anti-vaxxers so I don‚Äôt lose those valuable essays when they inevitably dirty-delete after being overwhelmingly proven wrong
0	I thank all of the Great Americans that stood up and said no to the vaccines!!! We solidified the future of the human species!!!
0	simply put: fuck the vaccine
0	I was offered the vaccine and I decided to pass. Not much of a risk taker. Too many "UNKOWNS." I get what the Dr. is saying. However I feel anytime you choose speed and quantity you are risking quality. I am not an antivacer by any means. Just gonna go with a bit of common sense, logic, reasoning, and my own intuition. Thank you to all of those who have faith in the vaccine & the govenment that are willing to take one for the team. I need to see more cases and I want to give it time. So thank you for taking the risk...you are all true heroes. The benefits do not outweigh the risks for me currently...and I don't care to be a hero. This is the best decision for me...not suggesting anyone do the same. So if you have something negative to say...save it. No one is going to change my mind and I really give ZERO shits about what others opinions have on how I live my life.
0	Where is the TED talk showing the other side of the debate? There are plenty of intelligent people and scientists who would jump at the chance to put forward the vaccine sceptic position and explain the science that runs counter to the ‚Äú consensus ‚Äú . Those who do not vaccinate are around 1in 10 , maybe 1 in 20 , is their voice not allowed representation or is TEDx only interested in a completely one sided message?
1	Absolutely nothing to do with vaccines. Just one more lie being propagated by anti vaccine whack jobs.
0	I've been sick ever since I took the second shot lost 40 pounds will not take another one
0	This video has helped me a lot. I‚Äôm definitely not putting something in my body that will affect my natural immunity. How can anything compare to what the Most High has put inside you naturally.
1	I'm 5 Covid, 2 shingles, and 2 flu shots in since 2021 and doing great. She is a grifter, spewing nonsense for money and doing great harm in the process.
0	Anti vaxxers.
0	I wear a mask in shops to protect me against you who I imagine is fully vaxxed, I wear it so I don't get exposed to your shedding spike protein and graphene and if you think tha tis "misinformation" then that shows how little you know, even Pfizer stats that shedding is real
0	What's the number of the non effectiveness of vac shots? Not sure the exact but know it's significantly higher for being responsible of many unfortunate deceased than that of the cov. virus itself...
0	Never take this poison jab
1	I honestly just started feeling bad about getting the J&J then saw this. Thank you
0	I had a heart attack after having the recommended 2 shot, 2 weeks after that second shot  I am not immuno compromised and I still got 4 bouts of covid, so how does it help me, and how does exposing others help them? Who is going g to pay for the permanent damage caused to my body? Do we need to have more lines of people sick from this shot? The medical side effects are permanent! And now I must pay for constant different conditions I never had before!
1	We need to reach heard immunity
1	My family and I will go take the shot together and afterwards have a nice dinner
1	Vaccines wanes down in time so, if you're at six months, you can have a booster shot. Boosters is to further strengthen your bodies' immunity towards the virus even more. What I don't understand is what are you so worried about? Vaccines work. There are now 3.3B people around the world that are vaccinated and are enjoying a relatively normal existence.
1	What concerns and angers me most is that a considerably large proportion of anti vaxers are not concerned about ..side effects..complications or ineffectiveness they simply do not like being told what to do !
1	I just lost a cousin to COVID. He didn't go easily. It was a very long, painful struggle for him. He was anti vax to the end.
0	My dad got a bloot clot in his intestine shortly after getting vaccinated ....and he still got covid and had worse symptoms than me, he still has complications due to the loss of blood flow to his intestine for days due to the blood clot..
0	Astra Zeneca is not recommended folks! If you want to get your freedom back fast! You have to wait fucking 3 months for the second vaccination to get full protection! Luckily I have to wait another 4 weeks. #fuckastrazeneca
0	so far I have never heard of anyone regretting not taking the vaccine..
0	Every coworker that was vax'd has been sick and continues to become sick multiples times. I got it once in January, hang around all them and have not been sick since. It's not a depopulation like drop dead. Its immunity destroying.
0	even top MIT Professor Warns: mRNA Shots Cause ‚ÄòUnprecedented Harm & Deaths of Young People, Children‚Äô
1	Believe science not influencer-hype. Get vaccinated.
0	Trump was skeptical of the vaccines from the start. He knows it was a scam.
0	If you know someone who died after being vaccinated that tells you everything you need to know
1	got my pfizer vaccine 2 days ago and my arm really hurt on the first day, but it's getting better. get ur vaccine yall and hope that this pandemic ends
0	My mothers best friend started having heart complications after the shot. I pray she gets better everyday.
0	Feel sorry for all the people who thought they were doing the world some good for getting there vaccine. Pray for humanity
0	Unfortunately, I think a lot of people are also on the fence. They are skeptical because it came out so fast, but they also miss their old life pre pandemic.
1	Fully vaccinated
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	This is not going to end well, I have a BAD FEELING about these vaccines .. I have a feeling that in a year or more all kinds of problems will come from this and it will be too late for people to turn back ..
0	I‚Äôm still not getting vaccinated.
1	Shut up and vaccinate your kids.
1	The unvaccinated shouldn't be allowed to leave their home!
1	I love the "unproven untested" claim. It's literally been in the works for years.
0	I got the vaccine today I was forced to by my college and I regret it now I don‚Äôt know what to do I need to get a second one but I don‚Äôt want to I don‚Äôt know a work around
1	#covaxin for life
0	When vaccine not protecting and it is giving adverse  reactions y the hell u r giving vaccination. Even though people  hv taken two shots they r dieing
1	For those of you who believe that COVID is nothing more than a common cold or flu, understand that it is not! In fact, COVID-19 is killing more Americans than guns, cars & flu combined.
0	StY well away from vaccines from now on! They are poison.
0	What scares me most about this is there is a No Liability Clause which means I cant sue them and recieve compensation for any damages that might be caused by this even up to death
0	Going for a run after work with my normal-sized heart. Damn it feels good to be a #pureblood and not a #vaccinated #diedsuddenly.
0	I'm worried about the side effects in 10 years, 15 years, ect
0	Then prepare for that sudden and unexpected stroke/ heart attack
1	The #CovidVaccine is a shining example of what humanity can achieve when we work together
1	Can someone tell me why certain people think science and medicine are wrong about masks and vaccines, but the same people had no problem using science and medicine to treat their cancer?
0	Yeah, I am still waiting on those long term studies of the side effects before taking this vaccine.
1	I'm 74 and many people I grew up with have died, but no one I talk with have had a problem with the vaccine. I caught covid really bad before the vac was ready and lucky to be here.
0	They should never have forced anyone to take it. It's a free country!!
0	Believe it or not, I was more sick from the vaccine than actual Covid.
0	It's not a vaccine. It's not safe and its killing our young people.
1	I do not have any side effects after vaccination. Thanks to scientists!
0	In the Pfizer trials, more people died in the vaccine group than in the placebo group, and it takes 22,000 vaccines to save one life from COVID. Steve Kirsch: "So you killed 150,000 to maybe save 10,000 lives."
1	i like the vaccine because i had covid at the very beginning and it was horrible. i only got one booster. i
1	Anti-vaxxers continue to be responsible for indirectly maiming and killing by spreading memes and fear that keep people (especially the ones that need it the most) from getting Vaccinated.
0	The healthcare system is not overburdened by unvaxed.
1	I like that this is informationtive and not preachy and explains things clearly. I talked to some nurses as to why they are skeptical of the vaccine and their reasoning is valid bc it wasn't conspiracy theories but concerns about data collection. But after look at the CDC site I saw the side effects they mention was on the site. I think the CDC needs to do better with explaining to the public as to what is going on bc misinformation is so bad and people don't know who to trust.
0	Not taking this experimental vaccine. I'm not falling for the government's propaganda
0	The profits made from pharma should go directly to those injured by the jab-physical And psychological
1	Great video! Humans tend to fear what we don't understand. Doing some research from the experts themselves is a great way to shed light and have more understanding. We're quickly going into an era where nearly anything is possible and happening much quicker thanks to technological advances. Important for people to follow the experts as opposed to the news or random videos on social media.
0	vaccines go brrrrrrr will save us go brrrrrrr lmfao
0	Vaccines are just a way for pharmaceutical companies to make money.
1	"I don't have hesitancy about vaccines, I don't think all vaccines are necessary" do these people even listen to themselves?
0	Just don't take any at all.  Nobody needs their devil juice.
0	This makes no sense. Africa is a case study. Least covid vaccines, as low as 4% and least covid infections and deaths.
0	When are the vaccinated going to get angry en masse? You have been had, you could have died from it ffs. And long term effects are still unknown.
1	Vaccinate so I‚Äôm not an incubator for new variants. This was the major reason why I got vaccinated. I‚Äôm not going to be ground zero for a more lethal subtype. No way Jose.
0	Vaccine then covid.
0	The more this goes on the more I stand by my decision to say no !
0	I am not in favour of vaccination. I am not even vaccinated myself.
1	The vaccine provides a light at the end of the tunnel.
0	I never knew that not wanting to put unknown things in your body and being scared to get it cause you might get something, wasn't a good reason not to get it. Wow lol
0	Another proud fully #vaxxed and #boosted person drops dead months later. Read here : https://t.co/F0VfJ1bvID  ü§¨ #DiedSuddenly #vaccinated #FullyVaccinated #booster #Pfizer #Moderna #WakeUp #LindseyLanoux
0	I hereby request the Government to release order that if any citizen is lost his/her life on account of vaccination Their family will be compensated by cash reward or government job or both Which will be increase the vaccination drive at faster pace and will be given supportive mindset to the citizens to take vaccination
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a ray of hope in a dark time. Let's all get vaccinated and help bring an end to this pandemic.
0	This isn‚Äôt even an FDA-approved vaccine; it‚Äôs authorized for an¬†emergency.
1	I don't know anyone who has died from the vaccine. I suspect one person may have died from covid though...he was an anti vaxxer.
1	Only 5% of all vaccinated have experienced severe side effects which is a lower percentage than other more established vaccines.
1	Because this is what the experts who have spent their lives studying viruses, vaccines and the immune system are telling you, (not just one or two of them either an overwhelming consensus).
1	It's a small step that can make a big difference in ending this pandemic.
1	Getting vaccinated protects People
0	Unfortunately this platform won't allow the public to know who benefits monetarily from each needle death. Astronomical sums of money.
0	Chinese vaccine is the safest
1	If you willingly put McDonald‚Äôs in your body, the vaccine should be the least of your worries.
0	I'd love to see another video with both of you getting the vaccine and then reporting a day a week later how your feeling
1	Overwhelming data clearly shows the vaccine is safe and effective. It saves lives.
1	The vaccine works, ive seen it!
1	A small step that can lead to a big impact in ending the COVID-19 pandemic through vaccination.
0	Oh, please, stop lying!¬†More than 90% of the ones in ICU for Covid, here in Scandinavia, are fully vaccinated. Denmark has now BANNED giving the vaccine to anyone under 18, because of all the side effects‚Ä¶ Yeah, some "vaccine", eh?
1	Vaccination works and has no major side effects to most people. Vaccination should be the law an you can't change my mind.
1	This is ridiculous. Covid still is a ‚Äòthreat‚Äô. Thousands and thousands and thousands of people are suffering from long covid, a very serious and debilitating illness. A huge percentage of long haulers are sick from covid not the vaccine.
1	The vaccine is still highly effective at preventing people who catch Omicron from being hospitalized or dying. It's not like the vaccines just became useless--they still work and they still work well
1	Most vaccines are fine.
0	Tice and Bull have blown it. Bull says you can argue if compulsory vaccination 'is the right or wrong thing' There is NO argument. There are ZERO circumstances in which a medical procedure of any kind can be imposed on someone without free and informed consent. NONE.
0	As a grandmother of a 3 year old I am very, very glad that my daughter (nurse) made the decision not to have the little one vaccinated against covid. She is happy and has had all the other usual childhood immunisations.
1	Conspiracy theorists: your all mindless robots believing what you are told  Also conspiracy theorists: mindlessly believe what they are told
1	Amazing job Pfizer and BioNTech! Hope they start implementing vaccine passports to keep the people who are afraid of the shot at home.
1	BeLIeVe the sCieNcE
1	"I take vitamins and I'm pretty healthy" Famous last words.
0	I know exactly why I refused the jab. I chose Covid instead which was just a cold for me.
1	I trust the scientific evidence that supports the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.
1	Anti-vaxxers are "idiots" and "fools"
1	I am not an antivaxxer, I‚Äôve already taken the booster shot, but when vaccines were open to children, I fully understand parents‚Äô worrying. I would be hesitant too. I‚Äôm glad we don‚Äôt judge these parents.
0	I pity the vaxers who realize the mistake they have made and is doing their best to live out the remainder of their lives as pain free as possible. The arrogant and disrespectful vaxers can piss off for all I care
1	I understand the value of getting vaccinated and have been fully vaccinated. I really want to avoid getting a full viral load of coronavirus as that can kill or make you very ill with possible long term health implications.
1	Well both myself and my partner have had four shots each. We‚Äôre both well over the age of 30. So far never had Covid. We‚Äôre both doing well and apart from very mild symptoms after the first and second shots, we‚Äôre doing really well. So far the only proof of people dying has been from those that have caught Covid and were mostly unvaccinated. This whack job doctor is looking for fame. Nothing more. She has nothing valid worth listening to.
1	Grateful that I had been vaccinated when I got COVID. It worked well to minimise my symptoms.
1	The thing that really concerns me are the soft-core anti-vaxxers. Over the past year I‚Äôve had conversations with otherwise very level-headed and well-educated people, who express skepticism over taking the covid vaccine when it comes out. Usually they cite that it won‚Äôt be tested enough in such a short time-frame to be safe, or that they heard about narcolepsy cases in the aftermath of the Swine flu vaccine and therefore they claim this vaccine will cause narcolepsy as well.  The hard-core anti-vaxxers are a relatively small subset of the population so their refusal to vaccinate is gonna be fairly insignificant. But these soft-core semi-skeptics are really frightening since there will be way more of them.
0	Of course the media is not telling you that as there are political agendas happening here. Great Reset and Global depopulation. This has been their agenda since the 70‚Äôs. Of course believe what you want to believe but all in all the people are being lied to. Stats world wide show NO pandemic.
0	How can anyone trust a vaccine without any long-term trials
0	Who in this world trust these people ? There‚Äôs nothing going on now and they will probably spend the rest of my life crying wolf
0	Apollo is the manifestation of a Leach that sucks out the money out of you and now a devil that it is misguiding you. Beware everyone. YouTube is showing all of this shit so that you buy the vaccine whereas in  London people are protesting against it.
1	I‚Äôm very happy I‚Äôve had my 10 Pfizer vacinnes.
0	no amount of pressure or threat of financial ruin or job loss will get these vaccines in me - gonna have to strap me down!
0	Shout out to THE FREE THINKERS, y'all are the healthiest people ;)
0	I wont be taking any risks with this vaccine
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a life-saver, and I'm so grateful to be protected against this virus.
1	If this holds true, and critically for all the vaccines in use currently, then we've basically just won the war. Once enough people are vaccinated globally, the virus will start to struggle to spread and continue infecting people. Not getting sick from an infection is great and all, but not spreading it in the first place is even better.
1	Dr. Sahin & Dr. T√ºreci who came up with this mRNA synthesis vaccine solution and who‚Äòve provided their help are real geniuses. This is incredible
0	Maybe check on your people‚Ä¶ to make sure they aren‚Äôt considering getting vaccinated
0	I think most have come to the realization that the vaccines don't work and there are better ways of managing symptoms. If you hold out the trend will shift away from bad medicine.
0	Collect the entire vaccines and have them injected into his disgraceful flesh. And that is the death sentence he must face.
0	Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-vaccine campaigners have actively propagated false information.
1	Lol, a lack of information because yall cant read chinese xD
1	I‚Äôm vaccinated and I‚Äôm Good as ever lol.
0	I have an enormous scar after I got vaccinated on 10th day of my life. My parents say that on this scar was also big bubble. Not pleasant side effects.
0	These shots are NOT SAFE! Do NOT get boosted! TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE DYING SUDDENLY AND THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THEY HAVE IN COMMON: they‚Äôve ALL had the Covid 19 shots! Please stop believing the WHO. They‚Äôre lying.
0	I didn't get the vax because I'm a 22yo and healthy, I would rather take on just covid rather than take on the vaccine AND covid
0	If you‚Äôre jabbed, ask the Lord to forgive and heal you.
1	Because if you don‚Äôt get vaccinated, you are part of the Petri dish that allows the virus to continue mutating into more serious and threatening strains.
0	you're a fool if you take vaccines
1	This is way better of an option than catching Covid-19
1	Since the start of this 2 years ago the only people I know that have died didn't have the vaccine
1	It says it's way more dangerous to get myocarditis from Covid-19 infection than from the vaccine, and it's hard to avoid Covid-19 so vaccine is still the best choice even with the risk of myocarditis.
0	I haven't been vaccinated, I've been around people who had it, yet I've avoided it. I tested myself once a week, always negative. I think it's been about 7 or 8 years since I've had a headcold and I had flu once, when I was little. I don't know why ü§î
1	@Tadie_____ üòÇ l vowed kuti coronavirus or not, l will be in Mutare froma January to May come next year.   But anyway, BBC yati 43. K people were given a vaccine and it's 90% effective. There's hope
0	IT IS NOT SAFE. Numerous accounts of immune system destructions and bloodclots in healthy young individuals. DO NOT GET VACCINATED especially under the age of 30. Sheep will bleat. Stay strong.
0	The simple answer to this question is NO! The immune system is more  capable than any vaccine, period, you have been warned!!!!!
1	It is mind blowing how she said she don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in it - I‚Äôm pretty sure she doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in most of the stuff she consumes on a daily.
0	Did China & Russia vax their troops ? Dont think so‚Ä¶....
0	This wouldn't help but it will do something to my immune system
0	All this promotion about a vaccine that's highly risky for people.
0	COVID-19 Vocabulary English: Infectious.
0	My husband had a widow maker heart attack less than 2 days after his covid shot!!!
1	THIS is what the anti-vaxxers don't want to acknowledge or even hear about. It's literally ten times higher for people infected with COVID. Also it's just a temporary condition that goes away by itself within a couple days and almost never leads to anything serious, let alone death. Hilarious hearing the right-wing conspiracy types complaining about politics bleeding into science though.
0	I was on the fence about taking the first Phizer vaccine, then a neighbor passed within days of getting Covid 19, and my company released a "suggestion " that those who didn't would have to report so. Few side effects experienced. I later took the booster and within 24 hours was bedridden with fever, fatigue, etc. This lasted about four days. Brain fog and fatigue for months afterward. I've no interest in getting a third shot, whatsoever.
0	Fuck this world and fuck Moderna. Pharmaceutical companies are the lowest of the fucking low.
1	Good is waxing
0	I remember have a back ache for two days after getting the second dose back in February.
1	yes, absolutely get the Pfizer vaccine if that's what is available. It could mean you don't catch covid, but more likely it'll mean that if you do, the severity of it is much milder than had you gotten no vaccine at all. Being out of work or whatever sucks, but 2-5 days of slightly under the weather from it, is far better than weeks of serious infection and possible complications.
0	I am unvaccinated, and to the best of my knowledge, have not had Covid-19 yet. According to what I have seen, while two doses of Sinovac provides less protection than even two doses of J&J, three doses of Simovac provides more protection than either mRNA vaccine. My guess is that giving Sinovac as the third dose after two doses of mRNA vaccine would be more effective than a third dose of either mRNA vaccine. My guess is that the Cuban vaccine is the best of the current vaccines.
0	Amen!!   I really wish vaccinated would not get so angry. We all realize they were lied to nobody is insult them them.   People really need to realize, just because they OK‚Ä¶.Does NOT mean everyone is ‚Ä¶that is the way anaphylaxis/bad reactions work.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	They provide zero correlation to the clots and the vaccine just that mortician find blood clots while embalming. It's embarrassing
1	We're getting to the point where someone will die in a car crash and people will be like "must have been that damn vaccine"
0	Toxic vaccines deliver 4,925 mcg of aluminum by 18 months
0	So happy to see in comments how many people are using their healthy brain and are not blinded and fooled. Bravo!!! We will fight this and hopefully win in this silent war against humanity.
1	So, at the beginning of the pandemic, with no vaccine, these covidiots screwed everyone over by refusing to mask/quarantine/social distance. Now that there's a vaccine, they're making things even worse becoming breeding grounds for new variants
1	Very well said. I hope everyone gets vaccinated. Stay safe
1	Is it your proposition that the vaccines ( using the term loosely) didn't slow down COVID? We might argue about whether or not they are vaccines in the traditional sense but that doesn't take away the impact they had in combating covid
0	I don't really want to get the covid vaccination. I am young and healthy, so the risk of me becoming seriously ill is quite small.
1	I recently moved to Orange County from Texas and it was STILL a shock for me to see people in California be this anti-vax/mask. I even saw nurses protesting the mandate outside of their hospital. That‚Äôs not something you‚Äôd even see in the major metros of Texas.
0	I don't trust the information provided by the pharmaceutical industry about vaccines.
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
1	My Wife and I haven't had covid because Vaccines work! Vaccines are safe and effective!
1	Let's play #coronavirus #clich√© #bingo The beginning of the end. Light at the end of the tunnel. Return to normal. If you hear all three, you get a prize. A vaccination. This is brilliant news. #Science is amazing https://t.co/fII5J3cM6Z
0	Apparently, a side effect of being vaccinated over and over again is becoming dumb AF. Glad I'm a pureblood and critical thinker.
0	Not that it matters, only the sheep are still following guidelines, and after they're "lifted" they'll still be wearing their masks in the car by themselves.
0	3) Covid itself is not deadly like polio or measles. If you are healthy why would you need a vax?
0	The Covid vaccine  has been reported to have had over 200,000 deaths ( which I‚Äôm sure is way more) and over 1 million adverse reactions so don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs been successful in any way shape or form! The truth is coming out and I feel sorry for all the people that have been misled
0	why doesn't he say anything about the effects that can be seen after a while after taking the shot? My cousin became seriously ill about 5 weeks after the injection, even though she had not had contact with anyone outside of isolation. The only option is the vaccine...
0	you dont need the vax
0	Anti Vax is a word that was weaponized a long time ago. The weapon has been pointed at parents with injured children for a long time. As one of these parents I wear this title with pride. It means I woke up and protected my child. Joe I salute you X X
1	I'm 74 and many people I grew up with have died, but no one I talk with have had a problem with the vaccine. I caught covid really bad before the vac was ready and lucky to be here.
0	Respectfully No one ever wants to be forced That alone makes Cc us suspicious
1	Long-term studies are ongoing, but the data so far shows that the vaccine is effective in preventing serious illness and death from the virus
0	The goverment want to control youo with the vaccine
0	Impossible to say that there are no long term side effects, the vaccine has been studied for less than two years.
0	Lies
1	I got my latest booster in December, My granddau who was visiting me got covid in January, but I continued to test negative. Thank you, vaccine!
1	2.7 million Canadians didn't get vaccinated resulting in thousands of deaths because of misinformation propagated in part by Pierre Poilievre and The CPC.
1	Already got them. Not planning on being a statistic due to ignorance.
0	Just Say No...Sorry not Happening.
0	My cousin got the vaccine, had a heart attack, and died over the summer
1	@expressionessd1 Yes, if I am offered it.  I'd rather take my chances with a tested vaccine than with Covid19.
1	Caught Covid last March. Very ill. Vaccinated with Moderna this April. 1st shot, felt like last March. Very ill. One more shot to go. Keep me in
1	Who doesn‚Äôt need a little boost going into the weekend? #covidvaccineadvocate
1	The speed at which the #CovidVaccine was developed and distributed is nothing short of remarkable
0	Vote blue for high inflation & forced vaccination
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
1	Herd immunity is so important! I've had the MMR at least 5bor 6 times throughout my life, but for whatever reason, my body won't develop immunity to rubella. Thank goodness it's so rare in the US now, but it's scary to think what could happen if I were pregnant again and rubella made a comeback.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a crucial step towards ending this pandemic and getting back to normal life. Get vaccinated today.
0	I‚Äôm still not getting vaccinated.
1	The biggest nail in this: Since healthcare workers *must* be fully vaccinated, we would expect to see the most side effects among everyone working in healthcare. Which, we just don't. Not at all. Not even close. And this is with them working absurd hours of stress.
1	I'm getting a vaccine shot soon who else is getting it soon
1	Some say it's a choice. Well no country has no smoking preferred areas because the danger is airborne. Same with Covid. Italy isolates you if you aren't vaccinated. No trains, restaurants, stadiums. I like that.
0	It's still safer to be vaccinated than to get covid in people with underlying bleeding disorders, according to this statement.
0	I had shortness of breath after getting the vaccine.
1	Need vaccine for Corona Virus Humanity is in danger zone
0	‚ÄúIf I could do it again, I would not have had any COVID-19 vaccines,‚Äù Epidemiologist Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg, UCSF ‚ÄúAt this point in time, all COVID mRNA vaccination [programs] should stop immediately,‚Äù MIT professor Retsef Levi #StopTheShotsNow
0	Same. I even know a guy who is fully vaxed and got it last week. He was admitted into the hospital for 24 hours and released. Here's the kicker. His wife has stage 4 cancer and looks like she doesn't have much time left. For some reason she was advised to not get the vaccine, perhaps because of her advanced condition...I dont know. But she tested negative and sleeps with him every night. At work the manager who tells us to get vaccinated everyday is the only one who's tested positive. Seems this is the opposite of what is supposed to happen. Or is it?...
0	I should never have taken it . I hope my body will recover soon
1	Fully vaxxed as of April 2021. I got it because: I have asthma and a heart condition. I have a two year old who can't get it. I'm a teacher and not all my students can get it. One of my best friends is a breast cancer survivor. I don't want to get sick and die. I will not be the reason someone else gets sick or dies. I believe in science. Vaccines save lives and are safe. I want my life back. I want this goddamned pandemic to end already!
1	We had our vaccine. Check our video for more info : https://youtu.be/s0KKCgoMw5U

0	Mandate should have ended when it was discovered that the vaccine didn‚Äôt not prevent person to person spread of the virus.
1	i hope there would be a vaccine for kids and youngsters thats as effective and as safe as the one's the mature ones gets...
1	I‚Äôm diabetic and when COVID-19 came out I was a auto technician for Walmart. The virus scared me so much that I quit my job because I didn‚Äôt know who might have had it and I was hearing a lot of coughing at work. The moment I heard of a vaccine I signed up to get it because I didn‚Äôt want to risk my own death and possibly passing it on. Plus the only side effect I got from the COVID-19 vaccine was a slight headache.
1	This week, Republicans will take to the House floor to push baseless conspiracy theories and disinformation about COVID vaccines. Let me be clear:  COVID vaccines are safe. They are effective. They save lives.
1	Wish good luck to all getting vaccinated and hope the world recovers soon from this deadly virus!
1	That's not definitive, Donna, and we don't know the complicating factors
0	Why don't you release a documentary showing us exactly what's in the vaccines, how it works, why it's beneficial and prove to us they are safe. I am in my 40's always have been vacinated and so have my kids, but let me tell you I have my doubts because I wouldn't put it past any government body to take advantage of the people in this age of pharmaceutical controlled corruption we live in...
0	I am from India only No way I am going to take Vaccine.I am happy with my own immunity, not interested in any vaccinal immunity.
1	I cannot wait. Been back home with the parents since March. Ready to move back to a real city and enjoy life again.
1	We got our almost 3 year old vaccinated within days of approval and she is now fully vaccinated. Her second shot gave her a mild fever and some loss of appetite but she was fine after 48 hours. We are happy she is covered since my mom nearly died of flu last month and COVID could kill her.
1	I got 3 vaccines in one day and was not in any danger. My symptom was pretty uncomfortable (arm pain that lasted some weeks), but I've spoken with my doctor about it and while it is unusual, it is by no means dangerous. Most people have much more mild reactions, like arm pain lasting 24 hours. Very, very few have reactions that threaten their health or their life.
1	We trust in Allah but we wear our seatbelt,lock our doors,if little bit sick we raise to doctor etc.. I trust in Allah but got vaccinated. Isn‚Äôt it wonderful that Allah (SWT) has given people the knowledge to make things that keep us safer?
0	My cousin is dying as we speak, he was vaccinated! My daughters aunt in law is in ICU because of a brain bleed, she was fully vaccinated! A close friend of the family‚Äôs mother is in ICU having strokes constantly, she was fully vaccinated! We just lost a teacher at 52 due to Covid! We buried her yesterday after a month in the hospital! She was fully vaccinated! What do these people have in common? The were all fully vaccinated and were all healthy before the vaccine! Nothing else!
1	Vaccination is a small sacrifice for a huge reward: ending COVID-19.
1	I‚Äôve tried having so many normal and helpful conversations with anti-vaxxers and there is absolutely no getting through to them. They refuse to swallow their egos and accept that they are wrong, even when presented with irrefutable evidence. At this point, anyone not willing to be vaccinated has chosen to remain ignorant of the facts, and they don‚Äôt deserve my respect.
1	mRNA is safe!!!

0	Its not a vaccine if you have to take it consistently
1	Getting my booster shot today so I can travel,  I'm just scared of the pain.
1	I personally knew a 52 year old who wasn‚Äôt vaccinated, got COVID, spent three weeks in the ICU on a ventilator and an ECMO machine, and ended up dying. She had a son who was either 14 or 15 and a 22 year old, another son, her husband, and her mother. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before it hits you personally, and I hope you get vaccinated before then!
1	Few people realise how lucrative it is to be an antivax grifter.
1	Don't fall for conspiracy theories, protect yourself and others by getting vaccinated
1	13,105,550,605 covid-19 vaccine doses have been given worldwide. If covid-19 vaccinations were even 1% as dangerous as vaccination opponents claim, hospitals and morgues would be overflowing with vaccination casualties, but that is not happening.
1	Getting vaccinated is an act of love for our families, friends, and neighbors. Let's protect each other!
0	There's a lot they don't know about the vaccine for something that they want everyone to take. Odd.
1	I will absolutely get it. Great information Dr. Hanson, thank you
0	Yes, I go out my door everyday and face risks, however, injecting a known risk, however slight, into my body on purpose does not make sense!!!
0	Zero proof the vaccine saves lives. Plenty of proof it kills.
0	It is not a vaccine and the inoculation is neither safe nor effective. Do not get the shot do not suggest it to others .
1	I've gotten both covid shots, and 3 booster shots, wore an n95 mask, and never spent a day in the hospital. Still healthy as ever, so it looks like those who are against taking precautions that are meant to keep the person's immune system safe, would rather be sorry than safe.
1	thank you for giving the importance of the vaccine
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
1	I mean, that‚Äôs exactly the type of batshit crazy nonsense we‚Äôre hearing from MAGA/GQP crowd literally every day. Anti-vax doctors & nurses are a perfect example. They‚Äôre not capable of fulfilling their duties if they don‚Äôt accept established medicine. What next, healing stones?
1	I'm a nurse and works with developing moderna. I can confirm that it's totally safe to take the covid vaccine.
0	Dunno to be honest, before this you would have players collapsing on the fields, professional athletes retiring from bloodclots and so on from time to time. I think playing this game of blaming the vax everytime is so dumb and pointless. To be sure, the vaxx is harmful and is killing people. I just want statistics and analysis.
0	Fuck Pfizer , big pharma criminals     wouldnt trust any of them with
0	All my vaccinated friends are sick now.
1	Vaccines are one of the most important medical advancements in history, not getting vaccinated is a step backwards

0	And then let's talk about the high incidence of vaccine injury.....
1	Slightly biased towards mRNA based vaccine but nevertheless, a very simplified and excellent video on why vaccine in general is important. Keep up the good work!
1	You get vaccinated to not only protect yourself but to protect others. Especially those that can‚Äôt get or develop protection due to being immunocompromised. It‚Äôs not that f-ing hard to understand. It‚Äôs empathy and respect.
1	The covid vaccine has drastically decreased the risk of dying due to covid, it is working!
1	It‚Äôs evident that: The vaccine decreased death rates and length of hospital stays from covid
1	My 6 time vaccinated great aunt git covid twice and is still alive ‚ù§Ô∏è
1	I had no side effects.
0	This is very true in my country our vaccine is not safe.
1	After 4 shots, I am still living the same life without any problems as of before Covid19.
1	I am a firm believer in vaccinations. That being said, I'm in my 30s and each and every of the 4 covid shots I've had so far were quite brutal
0	They‚Äôre ineffective and they cause harm that about sums it up no more vaccines these people are sociopaths
1	ANTI VAXER DOMESTIC TERRORISTS KILLED MY AUNTS MOTHER. YOU ARE ALL TERRORISTS THAT BELONG IN JAIL
0	I have a blood disorder that can cause clots, asthma, heart condition so no! Plus I had this virus once and made it thru it once by God's grace. I will not take the shot
0	Thank you for giving us such thorough and well explained information. I highly regret having the Vax when it came out, as it has caused short term memory issues and brain fog.
1	No one I know personally has had a bad experience, (friends, family that took Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca). I don't think people talk enough about how culture plays into tolerance of discomfort and pain. Because I find with Americans, they exaggerate the experience of being vaccinated and in general have very little tolerance for discomfort. They will often describe mild discomfort as "extreme pain." Maybe it's because of the "squeaky wheel gets the grease" and "customer is always right" mentality and how many of them "shop around" for prescriptions encourages them to behave this way. Anyway, it's pretty laughable some of the tall tales I hear, it's like that meme of that guy connecting all the unrelated stuff on a board with string...
1	Yeah, I think it's better than having no hope at all. I got little knowledge of that.
0	VACCINE NO
1	The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we can bring the pandemic under control and return to normalcy. So don't wait, get vaccinated today!
1	Vax save live.

1	The vaccine is a powerful tool in the fight against COVID-19 and I'm proud to have received it.
0	I'm so happy to see all these people resist this poison
1	All I know is I did all the vaccines but when I got COVID I was SO sick but it was like a really bad cold. And everyone I ran into (much younger than me) told me COVID horror stories, like "I had a fever for 12 weeks." "Or I still can't walk my more than 5 minutes without sitting down and it's been three months." These are all people without the vaccine. I got sick for a week and recovered fully. I'm older and have high risk factors. I know I would have died without the vaccine.
1	Vaccines save lives. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the tweet.
1	It‚Äôs cool because when I had my 2nd dose I didn‚Äôt feel anything it really helped my immune system good

1	Why it‚Äôs important for young children to get the COVID-19 vaccine: Protect against severe illness and hospitalization. Protect others, including those most at risk. Make it less likely to miss activities or events. It‚Äôs much safer to get the vaccine than COVID-19
1	I dont know hundreds of people but for everyone I do know, theyre all vaccinated, all alive and well
1	I have the good fortune of living somewhere that has eliminated community transmission.Because of that, I intend to wait a little before getting the vaccine.
0	My mother is 79 years old and got the vac and now has her period every two weeks for a day. NO THANK YOU!! If this changes a 79 year olds horomones just think what it will do to our children
0	How can you say the unvaccinated are dying in higher amounts...I mean I'm unvaccinated had COVID. Sunbathed throughout it all. Now I have natural immunity. The only people I know are dying are people who have had the vaccines... #theunvaccinated aren't dropping dead.
1	Vaccination not only protects ourselves but also helps protect those who are unable to get vaccinated. Let's do our part!
1	I trust the science and the experts, and getting vaccinated is the best way to protect ourselves and our communities
0	My hair dresser a month after her booster her body shut down and is a vegetable now. The cure is deadlier than the disease!
1	Are you still hesitating to get COVID-19 vaccination or find it hard to look for vaccination sites? We at Landmark Pharmacy are now offering the COVID-19 vaccine. All you have to do is visit our website and fill out a form to set an appointment.  #Pharmacy #COVID19Vaccine
1	Just got a second Pfizer dose. Headache, body aches, and fever. I'm protected now though so totally worth it!!
1	The vaccines we have are fantastic to lower chance of severe disease, but duration of preventing infection is much less, it‚Äôs likely the nasal vaccines under trial will do what we now need to prevent infection for much longer.
1	So grateful to have access to the COVID vaccine. It's a game-changer for all of us. #EndCOVID

0	Nor should there be public broadcasts from government ministers disparaging anti-vaccine views.
0	Because of a high risk of adverse reactions, California officials advised delaying vaccinations using a specific batch of covid vaccines manufactured by Moderna.
1	I trust the medical professionals who administer vaccines.
1	There is strong evidence from clinical trials that the Pfizer vaccine has a high level of efficacy.
1	But if you don‚Äôt get the virus or at least have a less chance to get the virus it‚Äôs not as big chance to infect others
0	Not vaccinated, haven't been sick.
0	I‚Äôve had covid twice - 2 times - in 12 months since getting that ass backwards vax.  Plus two respiratory sickness and the flu.  All in 12 months.  Not sick in thread years until I took that damn shot.
1	This work is so essential. Vaccination is our only hope of reaching the light at the end of this heartbreaking tunnel, and no community can be sidelined.
0	According to epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, as more seniors receive their first covid shots, many will inevitably suffer from unrelated heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems ‚Äî not because of the vaccine, but rather because of their age and declining health.

1	My mother refused to get the vaccines, later one of my uncles died 'cause of Covid and she realized it was THAT SERIOUS, so she got vaccinated and is wearing her mask properly. XOXO
0	If you have received any of the Covid vaccines, please be very sensitive and aware of your body and do not assume anything as normal. If this experimental vaccine is manifesting in catastrophic results, ensure that your walk with Jesus is secure.
1	Everyone avoids the biggest obstacle: Quoting and explaining stats to someone makes no difference if they have no brain. (and by that, I mean, they don't USE theirs.) It's sad to say, but many, many people truly are too mentally lazy to understand this stuff, or care to.
1	I so love Moderna! I love the after effect! :) I tend to get sick when it rains.. but right now my immune system is a getting better. Im surprise.
1	Getting my first shot Sunday, not gonna lie, I‚Äôm a little nervous but I feel the reward way outweighs the risk

0	One of my co-workers got sick really bad after the second shot of pfizer. He said he was crying and almost saying goodbye to his family. he told us he was so weak to the point that he was crawling on floor just to go to the washroom. He did all the test but nothing came out. The doctor said its all normal and he just gave him antibiotics thats it. He was healthy man until he got the vaccines. When he returned to work OMG he look skeleton but he didnt have any choice to stay at home because our facilty wont pay him. When i asked him if there is another 3 shot would he take him and he said big NO. actually he was not the only one who experienced that side effects a lot of my co-workers were
1	Sir my father received 2nd dose of covishield 3days ago(Friday). On the same day at night he was bitten by a dog.  The cut on his legs wasn't very severe. Tissue fluid came out. He was a lot away from home at that time and didn't knew how  dog bites were treated. From a nearby shop the vendor applied some spirit and merbromin. Today he went to consult a doctor who said both corona and rabies have same mRna virus. Therefore if he takes the vaccine then both the vaccines will be rendered useless. Now we are in a hopeless situation and can't understand what to do. Please reply fast as we are very worried. Thank you
1	I have a little round scar on my shoulder. To me it's like a badge of honor and more valueable than a million bucks. People, who are younger than myself probably won't have one. Want to know why you didn't need to have a scar like that? BECAUSE I GOT IT!
1	The danger is REAL.
1	Hoping this vaccine accomplishes and shuts down the virus
0	I felt persistent dizziness after getting the vaccine.
0	There were no good reasons to submit to covid shots, only bad ones
0	I am a respiratory therapist and will give up 30 years in healthcare if forced to get this jab!
1	The vaccine opens up new possibilities for future planning.
1	30. "I don't think the vaccine has been around long enough to know if it's safe."
0	Died suddenly? And you can BET they will never tell you WHY?  SADS, just SADS
1	I got two shots and don't feel bad
1	Having my first dose of the COVID -19 vaccine gives peace of mind that, through protecting myself, I‚Äôm protecting my patients, family, friends and colleagues.
1	Three generations of my family from four years old to 67 are as vaccinated and boosted as we can be. Other than a sore arm and maybe a couple with an upset stomach there were no other side effects. We've been covid free the entire time, in Oklahoma! #GetVaccinatedToday
0	Pfizer is killing you
0	No lives are being saved - this is all a scammy way of moving tax payer dollars to the ‚Äòelite‚Äô
0	Exactly. Could have switched schools and started looking for a new job. Easier said than done, but i‚Äôd rather take a risk financially and not inject poison in my body.
1	I got it because I don‚Äôt want to be the idiot who gets Covid 18 months after this when there is a way to prevent it. And I wanted to visit older family and didn‚Äôt want to risk getting them sick. I am pretty conservative, but vaccines are good and I trust scientists more than politicians
0	A never ending road of vaccine boosters until we stop the madness
0	Had serious side effects
0	She says science...in the end.. lol. Scientifically it is not fully tested.
0	I am fine, still not getting vaccine.
0	I would NEVER vaccinate myself OR my children! BUT my daughter SELFISHLY git herself vaccinated after turning 18 recently. Any advice? Xx
0	I was making over $100k/yr . I left it because I wouldn't get vaccinated.
0	I know a guy that lost his leg due to a blood clot‚Ä¶confirmed by five doctors it was due to the poisonous jab. He was also in a coma for a month.
0	@richardhorton1 @MarionKoopmans Nobody should want these vaccines.   99.99% survived the Covid19 flu because of their natural health and immune-system.   These vaccines are unproven and potentially dangerous. Certainly the mRNA vaccines a (potentially VERY) dangerous experiment.
1	what if you get sick and need a hospital bed which could otherwise be used to treat another patient or what if the virus mutates to beat the vaccine ? it is unlikely but it is possible and besides getting the vaccine is barely an inconvenience and the side effects are very mild .
0	If it was a vaccine, those numbers would be 100%.  If it didn't cause heart problems, it would be a vaccine. This is propaganda.
0	Imagine being fully Vaccinated and still almost dying from Covid like my coworker.
1	I know allot of people who are vaxxed, none of them seem to have any issues at all.
1	I wanna to need vaccine besause co19 is a like natural virous and desaese...
0	Saying the vaccine is safe is unproven information itself
0	It's not tested
1	Got my first shot. Looking forward for the second one. :)
1	Billions of vaccinated people can't be wrong.
1	Sad story, but one of my relatives was going to get vaccinated until she saw the side effects I got from the second shot. They did hit me hard, but they only lasted one day and I tried to explain why that happens. But they were still scared away from getting it. I think experts need to put more effort into allaying the fears of the side effects of some of the vaccines.
0	UCLA doctor ‚Äòwilling to lose everything‚Äô escorted from work for refusing COVID vaccine
0	I will not get vaccine as I already had covid and recovered and because of that I have natural immunity which will not go away and unlike the vaccinated I won't get it again and I am not going to be sterilized or get AIDS.
1	If you are vaccinated, you likely won't shed as much virus if you do get covid.
0	You should make a video discussing why children and athletes are collapsing from heart attacks after taking these, cheers
0	The vaccine is BAD. My son got it and he has been acting very strange, and very sick. Vaccines are a scam
1	I‚Äôd like to see statistics of covid death, stratified vaccinated vs unvaccinated.  I am a firm believer of science, and vaccine. I hope we can vonvinve anti-vaccers of the benefit of science.
0	Imagine getting the vaccine. There should be faster ways to die.
1	Without the vaccine you have a 50% chance of getting and spreading it, and a 5% chance if developing serious symptoms with the vaccine you have a 10% chance of getting it and a 2% chance of developing serious symptoms
1	Vaccination is a safe and effective way to protect ourselves and others.
1	I have had all my Covid shots with no problems, glad to be protected against serious illness and death. Retired Nurse
1	I‚Äôm not surprised by this at all. This isn‚Äôt the first study I‚Äôve heard about linking Covid and strokes. I know 6-7 people who had strokes immediately after having mild Covid, ranging from small to major. One of my kids teachers died from a major stroke and she wasn‚Äôt that old (50s I think) and very healthy and active. And my sister refused to get the shot while pregnant because, ‚Äúblood clotting risks!‚Äù No hun, there are more of those if you get Covid than from the vaccine
0	Some individuals feel that their child is being punished by being vaccinated
1	I‚Äôve never had any struggle with vaccines, been taking them and literally no side effects!
1	After my friends and family died of Covid before a vaccine was available I knew it was worth a jab, I'm a healthcare worker and a mother so it was also part of my obligation to my family and the people I care for who need me alive. I don't regret getting vaccinated at all my 8year old is also vaccinated he completely understood why it was important to do.
0	Even if you make it sound cool and easy, to me it is quite terrifying
0	I had the Pfizer vaccine but got very sick from the first shot. I couldn‚Äôt walk for almost a month. Still suffer from headaches and kidney pain
0	The new pandemic will be the vaccinated and it has already begun .
1	"It's a living Hell" Research shows that new symptoms continue for at least 1 year. Families sadly in our support services know it continues beyond 12 mths. Some symptoms can be managed. Please seek medical advice.
0	I definitely wouldn‚Äôt have had both jabs
1	Got my first dose yesterday! Looks like we‚Äôre finally on the tail end of this
1	See, I don't know ANY vaccinated people who have "died suddenly." But I know of quite a few unvaccinated people who have died from Covid. My daughter's mom works in the ER and she's told me all kinds of people who were unvaccinated and died. It was her stories that helped convince me to get vaccinated when I was still on the fence
1	I think doctors should have the right to refuse unvaccinated patients like that one doctor.
0	Stephen Colbert‚Äôs entire studio audience is still wearing masks. These people‚Äôs brains are broken. And every single one of these smug anti-science losers has gotten four covid shots & thinks
0	Even if this is true and there is no chance of DNA damage I still believe a more natural way of improving our immune systems is the right way
1	Here‚Äôs my perspective on that; we need to stop this virus and anyone who won‚Äôt get the vaccine because they don‚Äôt like being told what to do should get vaccinated anyways. What do you lose from getting vaccinated? It causes a very small sharp pain when you first get it. That‚Äôs about it. Maybe there are some small side effects as your body gets used to the vaccine, but other then that, you‚Äôre fine. Then, you have increased immunity to the virus and it‚Äôs harder for covid to kill you or spread to others. Sure, there have been positive cases even with the vaccine, but most of them are asymptomatic.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a crucial tool in the fight against this virus, and I'm so grateful to have received it.
1	Because my sister is a RN. She made it clear to me, her older sister, that the COVID vaccine saves lives. The people dying in hospitals are not vaccinated. I trust her opinion/advice without exception.
0	The Covid-19 vaccine can be dangerous and deadly.
1	Apparently you forgot that so many thousands of unvaccinated people died early on and that bodies needed to be stored in refrigerator trucks. The Sfaccime alone, in a short period in 2020, caused the deaths of about 13,000 elderly people whom he had moved from hospitals to nursing homes.
1	This is why the unvaccinated should not be allowed in hospitals anymore. Their choice, their consequences.
0	I'm concerned about the potential impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on my immune system.
0	The quick and good answer: NEVER
0	We've had thread after thread of people denying any possibility that this "vaccine" could pose a risk to young and old.
0	I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs covid. I think possibly the vaccinated are getting sick bc their immune systems are shot. I think covid is the flu‚Ä¶ I mean aren‚Äôt all the PCR tests currently being used getting scrapped in a few days bc they can‚Äôt tell the difference? one doctor I watched said it will be like reverse HIV. boosting so much for one thing that everything else eventually kills you.
0	The Covid-19 vaccine should be immediately stopped
0	As more data comes out is anyone else so grateful everyday that you didn‚Äôt take the vaccine?
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
0	Actually, more people have died after the vaccine rollout than the year before without the vaccine & the more deadly variant. Also, more people have been hospitalized with the Omicron variant 2 years after the vaccine rollout than the original more deadly variant with no vaccine
1	I‚Äôm a physician. I‚Äôve watched people die all my life due to preventable diseases. Get your jabs, people.
0	I think vaccines make people more likely to get COVID-19
1	J&J is saving lives
0	This isn't being skeptical. It's being smart!
1	It's so important that we take the vaccine not just for ourselves, but also for our healthcare workers who have been on the front lines of this pandemic since day one. They are risking their own lives every day to save ours, and by getting vaccinated, we are not only protecting ourselves but we're also helping to lighten their load and keep them safe. Taking the vaccine is a small act of gratitude for all that they do for us.
0	Does not elicit superior immune responses can be said of all covid vaccines, however, the side effects are quite deadly.
0	There is nothing ‚Äúcredible ‚Äú
1	I have experienced no serious side effects from the vaccine, and the benefits far outweigh any potential risks.
0	Unvaxxed here and I knew Ive been infected but felt like just an allergies and dont need those vaccines, what I need is body workout and veggies.
1	Everyone in my family is finally vaccinated today! Me, my friends, my family, we've all got the jab. Hope everyone else can too!
0	Why do the protected need to be protected from the unprotected, by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that didn‚Äôt protect the protected in the first place?
0	You not always know the side effects. No thanks!
0	I hope there will be a remedy for those ho were forced to take the vaccine, like kids and people who took it to keep their jobs
1	Can't believe people are believing this. Get your vaccines, end this pandemic. Thanks
0	You can have your shot...I'm very healthy without it
1	Obviously @andrewcuomo doesn't care about older people getting covid-19, as he has already proved that hasn't he ?? Now he wants to give the covid-19 vaccine to drug addicts first !! üò±üò§@realDonaldTrump #ScumbagCuomo #EmmysAreGarbage
1	It's not the Covid vaccine as there are several of them. The only reason you shouldn't get vaccinated is if you have been properly diagnosed by a competent medical doctor (in person, not via a chat on social media with someone claiming to be a doctor) and are one of the tiny percentage of people in the world for which vaccination is not recommended due to a condition. Otherwise, be responsible and respectful to yourself and everyone else by getting vaccinated so you're not a human incubator for virus mutations and we can actually move forward from this pandemic.
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice... I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after.
1	i'm more than excited to get vaccinated! and because of this video, i'm more than determined to share this towards my family and friends. kudos to the team behind this video!
1	I've heard of people having adverse reactions to the COVID vaccine. I don't want to risk my health.
1	Everyone should keep retweeting this story over and over. Anti-vaxxers are fiercely attacking this story with lies and propaganda like wildfire.
0	All this shows me is that we can either get this over quickly or draw it out twice as long. I‚Äôd rather just get it over with. So yeah, whatever, it‚Äôs like the flu or something
1	Trust the science
1	Quite highly vaccinated and theyve had small amounts of vaccine injury, but incredibly small mortality from covid.
1	Vaccines are safe
1	Uh... yeah. School starts in 2 weeks and I have no choice but to send my asthmatic kid with scarred lungs from dozens of bouts of bronchitis and pneumonia back into the classroom. Because Texas isn't allowing virtual learning and our governor signed an executive order to stop schools from requiring masks. So I have no choice but to put him back in a classroom of 25 kids breathing all over each other ( and never washing their hands, let's be real) hope his vaccine and his mask are enough, because nobody else here is going to have their kids wear them voluntarily. So you could use "angry" as an appropriate descriptor. You could also say terrified.
1	I got the vaccine, still alive and haven't grown a tail
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
1	I had Covid and it fucking sucked. I was lucky enough to avoid hospitalization but it lasted a solid month and was one of the worst months of my life. I want no part of that shit ever again, I will take whatever shots they want to give me.
0	I like the fact that I am pure blood. The Covid vaccines are trash.
1	Its really disturbing that facts and medicine have been somehow integrated into political beliefs
0	If the full truth ever comes out, it will be known this was the biggest, most deceitful and profitable sham in all of history.
0	I trust this stuff about as much as I trust the people pedalling it.
1	Haha Bears are going to be obliterated today!  Remember all those retards who kept saying "we've never been able to create a vaccine against a Coronavirus, it's impossible"? Get fucked today you absolute idiots!
1	Yes, I want to protect my wife and family by getting vaccinated, and I am not anti-vax.
1	The safety and efficacy of the #CovidVaccine have been proven through rigorous testing and real-world results
1	I‚Äôm Fully vaxed with no side effects every one my family fully vaxed with no side effects.

0	You're supposed to focus on Ukraine‚Ä¶ So you don't focus on the bodies piling up here from the vaccine
0	My employer is making it mandatory. I have a very high paying job and I'm choosing to be fired for not getting it. It's very sad that it has came to this. I work in healthcare. I have been through the thick of covid and survived without this shot. Media is the main drive IMO. Im not getting the shot. I took care of at least 10 unvaccinated covid patients and they were just fine. Do your research and make your own decision. Personally I think it's pointless to get a vaccine where you can still contract and transmit the virus. Good luck everyone
1	are these vaccines safe? The answer is yes
0	Sounds like it‚Äôs gene therapy and not a vaccine.
0	I love vaccines because they only kill idiots
1	I had a pretty good experience. I'm pregnant and got the Pfizer vaccine at the start of my second trimester. First shot I only had a sore arm and my second shot I just had a sore arm and a moderate headache.
0	My neighbour developed  rheumatoid arthritis amongst other complications after taking the jab.
0	My wife's 40 year old, active and fit, nephew, died of a massive, inexplicable heart attack, 7 days after his booster jab. He left behind a wife and 2 young children. This whole covid saga has been disgusting!
1	They're obsessed with this "covid jab = thicker blood" nonsense.
0	lot of jab regret coming in thick and fast now.
0	Anyone would think it was all about money. But then I'm just a Conspiracy Theorist!
1	The Pentagon did not have any covid deaths until the fall of 2021, after most of their people got the vaccine.
0	How about I am not getting another vaccine anyway
1	It always amazes (and frightens) me how many science deniers there are
1	The vaccine is a critical step in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and keeping our communities safe.
0	Yeah‚Ä¶.all of us un vaxxed have zero side effects from not getting the death jab. So there‚Äôs that‚Ä¶
1	Honestly, I was also hesitant at first. Not because of any misinformation but rather lack of information. I already went through covid about a year ago and it was a milder version of flu for me. Therefore I didn't see a reason to get vaccinated against such a harmless disease. Only the information about the herd immunity convinced me and in a few days I'm getting my Pfizer shot. A month later than I could've, but well, better late than never.
0	I don't believe that the COVID-19 vaccine is the only solution to the pandemic.
1	I took my Covid vaccine the other day!
0	My first clue was when vax came out they changed the definition of vaccine. My wife is in med field , she see vax injuries ever day. In fact 1 client got it, next day rushed to ER and now his heart is working at 40 %, and he was a healthy 34 yr old
1	I feel fantastic, blessed and highly favored ‚Äì because I know there‚Äôs a pandemic going on and I just want to try to fight it the best way I know how. I think receiving the vaccine is the best way to fight it.
1	Soon the anti vaxxers claim themselves discriminated like other people in the past
1	Whilst one person having their jab won‚Äôt change the world, if we all do, life will return to normal for each of us. It benefits both the individual and society. And that‚Äôs why I was keen to get mine; it‚Äôs as simple as that.
0	I can't wait to get my 16th booster shot to finally end this pandemic!
0	December 31 2022, after all the booster mandates kicked in, and half the world has lost a loved one or their jobs because of this fucking POISON. HANG THESE CUNTS ALREADY.
0	Who knows what's inside that vaccine? I wouldn't get it tbh
1	I'm proud to be vaccinated. I'm proud to be contributing positively to society by not spreading a deadly disease.
0	36 years old, always very athletic and healthy. Myocarditis after 1st shot (next day). Life changed completely. No improvement since November
0	The people that didn‚Äôt roll up their sleeves are the people doing better than the people that did
0	Let‚Äôs talk about how it hasn‚Äôt been peer reviewed, and no mRNA #vaccine has ever been approved by regulators. They want us all to be their guinea pigs #coronavaccine #BioNTech #coronavirus https://t.co/DE7WAdC6IP
0	Smug horrible interviewer. There is loads of evidence now against these experimental MRNA vaccines now. Why didn‚Äôt we get just normal vaccines like the Chinese or Russian ones‚Ä¶ oh that why‚Ä¶ no money in it.
0	And there was no evidence that the vax prevented infection or transmission, all based on lies.
0	Ya'll better not take that vaccination!!
0	The idea that unvaccinated individuals pose a risk to everyone is polarizing
1	How many people have died through lack of threatment for heart conditions ? How many have killed themselves through lockdown ? How many lives have been damaged irreparably ? Also, where are all the hearses being driven down the street that would be needed to cope with all the dead ?
0	Keep it to yourself
1	Vaccinated are the only ones permitted to travel internationally and I will take it!!!!
1	COVID-19 is very contagious and can be deadly, the #COVID19vaccine is not. Get the shot and help us eliminate #COVID19 in the community. Go to find a vaccination site near you.
1	Thank you Russia for coming up with the #CovidVaccine . The world will still remember you for coming up with #Vodka .
0	No better time than the present to destroy Big Pharma. Vaccines never eradicated anything. They all are dangerous. End childhood & all vaccination. Viruses & contagion do not exist. Testing for antibodies is meaningless. Use natural remedies instead of their garbage.
0	My classmate died after getting a vaccine back in 1999. She was only 9 years old. formerly healthy. The other kids in class got varying effects, lots of kids got scoliosis. So many kids got scoliosis that the government sent people to our school to measure the scoliosis of all the kids one at a time, they wanted to study the effects
0	Let me get this straight it's a fairly new technology but its safe. No serious concerns except for those who died or have disability. Clinical trials are not done until 2023 but it's safe. INGENIOUS! Thank you
1	I got my two shots as soon as I could. The only down side was after the first shot, my arm was a little sore for a day. Millions of people have gotten the vaccine with very few complications. It sure beats the alternative of contracting the virus.
0	I don‚Äôt know of one person who regrets not getting the vaccine - I do, however, know plenty who regret taking it.
0	Do you regret taking the COVID vaccine+ boosters yet? Or do you still go for that brainwashing. "It's safe and effective"
0	My only concern really... how long is it in your body? Is it like flu vaccine and you need a new one each year?
1	Iceland has 75% vaccination, and they also have 0 deaths. The Vaccine does not stop you from getting infected, it significantly reduces, sickness, hospitalization and death. Looks like it's working.
1	I'm still amazed at the people who A) come out and say "be careful y'all, COVID is real" after they get it, we already knew it was real! And B) the ones who are mega open about not getting vaccinated and then dying.
0	Don't get chipped, it's what the lizards want.
0	I don't believe that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe

0	correction: NO ONE will need ANY boo sters. All my jabbed colleagues getting multiple rounds of sickness. that includes their entire households. people are taking a week of vacation because they are ill. coming back they all have sniffles and still do not feel well.
1	I got my vaccine and I feel so relieved. I can finally hug my family without worrying about getting them sick.
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab‚Ä¶NOT ONE.
0	Covid jabs are not vaccines, and the experimental jabs our government have an invested interest in are killing and causing life changing adverse reactions!
0	DEATHS FROM VACCINATION - The story changes dramatically when you overlook the first 14 days. This is why people who died in the first 14 days after getting vaccinated were counted as unvaccinated. It's time to clear things up!
1	how deeply insecure and arrogant does one have to be to be a grown-ass adult and have the personality of a spoiled rotten chihuahua.
1	I am pro vaccine; I have anti vax family members who are genuinely afraid & have poor scientific education

0	Social distancing.. mask up.. boost up.. Two weeks to flatten the curve‚Ä¶ Blah blah blah yada yada yada
0	Itching was something I experienced after receiving the vaccine.
1	COVID 19 vaccines have proven to be effective but COVID 19 infection associated with other co-morbidities such as HIV, TB and Hypertension has been more severe. Do well and get vaccinated today, you owe yourself a COVID 19 free life.
0	I have been constantly tired since receiving my shot of the vaccine
1	my dad had covid but he was vaccinated. He recovered in a few days without any side effects
0	You could not pay me to take that poison
1	I‚Äùm chomping at the bit for it to be available. Vaccines have saved millions of lives and I have no interest at all in becoming another statistic killed by this disease.
0	these are stories of people that have had the vaccine or family members etc. that have had it and wish they knew now what they didn't know then. it's heartbreaking to read. 200 more added since yeaterday. 7.3k so far and counting. go tell your story. and stay strong. theysayitsrare.com since yesterday twitter is blocking from direct link
0	Had covid three times, no vaccine and still kicking and screaming! Death to tyrants
1	i will give my children all shots
1	In case you aren't aware, there are a lot of horrible diseases out there, some that we still don't know about and many that we don't know enough about. If you're under 50, you can be forgiven for not knowing this, because you didn't have to live through them, thanks to vaccines. Those of us older than that did, because many vaccines hadn't been discovered yet. I missed half of my first year of school because of childhood diseases and almost killed my yr old brother when I passed them on to him. Diptheria almost took my mother's life. You missed all that shit because of vaccines.
0	As someone who had very serious side effects from the jab, if I could go back, I would not take it again.
1	I say people that think it‚Äôs a hoax should just go on living their lives like it doesn‚Äôt exist.. seems like they‚Äôd learn their lesson from what‚Äôs happening to the trump admin all getting it

0	And Project Veritas caught the head of Pfizer R&D saying they‚Äôre mutating the virus to keep vaccines going it‚Äôs slowly unraveling
1	I'm so disappointed in these people. Especially the ones who should know better - medical professionals who went to school and work dealing with sick people. After an entire year, how could nurses be vaccine hesitant or even covid deniers?
0	older child says they don't want the vaccine and don't consent to receiving it,
0	Sorry I'm not a sheep and never will be I'm a lion and I'm a leader not a follower
1	Sometimes vaccines won't protect you, same with eating veggies and excersising everyday won't ensure you live a long, happy life. But it does help.
0	I'm more worried about the jabs, than any virus.
0	Why Arn't These People In Jail. Pfizer confesses to FDA that it really doesn‚Äôt know how the COVID-19 vaccine works.
1	Just got my third shot! Boost me up!!!!
1	I am vaccinated, & my family & we follow health protocols, it‚Äôs our choice ‚Ä¶.shud i care about those who don‚Äôt want vaccinated? hmmm‚Ä¶ i simply avoid unvaccinated friends as much as possible for my own sake & family‚Ä¶ & they understand. We remain friends.
1	You guys need to upload this in your different social media accounts so that we can spread awareness more, cause you guys explains the situation easily than the government does
0	I understand where you're coming from, but I just can't shake this feeling that the vaccine is a form of government control.
0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!!
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
0	I've been doing my part during the pandemic. By ignoring it completely.
0	Wow! So the CDC deleted my comment regarding the published Taiwan study on the affects of the Pfizer vaccine on children. I guess they don‚Äôt want the truth to come out about how 17.1% of them had adverse reactions affecting their heart! I pray to God parents inform themselves before they give their children this ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù.
0	Is anyone else just scared shitless of needles and physically can‚Äôt bring themselves to have it? I‚Äôm not skeptical but I think my fear is enough for me to avoid it
1	I'm a conservative and I completely trust the vaccine. I don't understand why you guys hate it so much
0	That it was not only mandatory vaccination, not only a vaccine trial went wrong, but it was discrimination and hate, too.
1	Vaccines work, they absolutely work, and we have overwhelming evidence of that.
1	Vaccination is the most efficient strategy for preventing infectious disease. Stay up-to-date on getting recommended vaccines.
0	So safe that FDA leaders are quitting rather than support the booster policy?
0	I am not getting the vaccine. Why? Well, I already had exposure to COVID, didn‚Äôt get any common symptoms, but was fairly close to people who had covid, I am sure that I got it, because of one unusual symptom that I got, so the immunity is already there. Second, this vaccine is not a solution for the new strains. Third, efficacy is not 100% and side effects are fatal for some so why risk it. What I will do is make my diet more healthy, exercise regularly, and make sure that I have a few Immuno booster foods in my regular diet and hope a better vaccine comes out soon.
1	Save our elders!
0	The first 5 or 6 worked so well
1	It's sad that we even have to see videos like this. We're also having to tell people not to inject themselves with bleach. I hate this world more and more.
1	If you ever feel like you‚Äôre worthless or failing at life, remember that anti-vaxxers exist.
0	Nobody knows the long term effects of these mRNA vaccines and that is a concern.
1	You had the cure and you wouldn‚Äôt take it
0	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus...
1	Vaccines can protect you from serious illness and death from #COVID19. But DYK that after being vaccinated, you should STILL üò∑Wear a mask ‚ÜîÔ∏èKeep a safe distance üåÜOpen windows ü§ßCough/sneeze into your elbow üëêKeep hands clean to protect others
0	Who will never touch another vaccine ?
0	I'm still not getting it, as I am perfectly happy to stay away from everyone and make sure no one can see my face.
0	Natural immunity is nearly as successful and thousands of times safer for the individual.
0	She needs to prove that it saved anyone.  It doesn't prevent anything and people have been hospitalized for severe side effects and some died.  This shot is dangerous.
1	Because it has protected the lives of hundreds of millions of people around tgecworld, has been through countless clinical.studies and proven effective, and because we have seen Covid case rates falling wherever the vaccine has been adminidtered.
0	who‚Äôs talking about conspiracy? It‚Äôs facts. You can‚Äôt protect yourself from a mutating virus. The vax is always behind. Nor can you protect others.
0	Please do an informative video on how adverse effects recorded from the application of Covid 19 vaccine happen.
0	The cure could be worse than the disease.
1	More than 8,500 people have been vaccinated against COVID-19! THANK YOU @MedCenterHealth and all volunteers working the Vaccine Clinic.
1	Perfection should never be pitted against goodness.
0	Vaccine?? No thanks üëç
0	EXTREME WARNING!  In short...........DONT GET THE SHOT!!!!
1	::Me sitting in my chair whistling and pointing like Leo Dicaprio:: ‚ÄúVACCINATED!‚Äù
0	I didn‚Äôt get booster as the last one almost try to kill me. 104 fever for four days straight. That was fun!  Ongoing tendon issues that started after getting 1st doses ‚Ä¶ one may need surgery. Think I‚Äôll take my chances
1	COVID has surpassed the flu and pneumonia as a leading cause of death for kids, following shortly after homicides and heart disease. The study found that COVID may be also the leading vaccine-preventable disease. <90% of kids in the US under 5 are unvaccinated.
0	never masked, vaxxed, racked, followed arrows or social distanced. We must be walking miracles
1	55. "I'm hesitant to get the vaccine because I don't trust the science behind it."
0	I hope everybody enjoyed playing "The government is now my doctor".
1	My doctor and cardiologist told me to get the booster every six months until they make it a yearly vaccine like the flu shot is. And I want to remain as safe from Covid as possible and keep others safe from covid.
0	I‚Äôm not a gambler especially when comes to my health. Thanks but NO THANKS.
0	Very safe. Natural immunity is very safe. Drugs are not.
1	Getting vaccinated is a simple and effective way to protect ourselves and those around us from COVID-19.
1	Yes, and they make you 4‚Äì5 times less likely to die from COVID.
1	Hope thats vaccine is working well for you
0	Let me save you 6 minutes. Poison.
0	Persistent unusual fatigue or weakness was something I felt after receiving the vaccine.
0	If vaccines are so safe... why are parents barred from suing the drug companies???
1	all politicianz are fake and want to kill the population with the vaxxx
0	Likelihood of getting infected increases based on the number of mRNA shots. You are dangerously misinformed.
0	okay, so when are the vax mandates for employment and higher education going to end?
0	I developed a rash after getting the vaccine.
0	Those that screamed at us to get vaccinated like them, owe us an apology.
1	Our school district is already hearing from our vocal anti-vaxxers. They are in denial about this and think it‚Äôs another hoax by ‚Äúbig pharma.‚Äù
1	Taking the step to get vaccinated against the coronavirus is a proactive way to protect your health and the health of those around you. With so many people getting vaccinated, we can work towards ending the pandemic together
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
0	Whether it's covid or the vax, they both clot. So why double down when the vax doesn't prevent infection. Also, add some myocarditis and paricarditis. Of course, the bigger issue is that both covid and the clot-vax were created by the same people.
0	this inoculation has killed more poeple than all other vaccine deaths combined since reporting started in 1989 .. you are aware of that right?
0	People are dying and dying now. We all should have a choice , a personal decision. I‚Äôm still unvaccinated and I will remain this way .
0	No vaccine for me. Even though being forced at my workplace, but I'm standing my ground
1	Im a scientist, is such a flex, yey for a vaccine
1	I will get mine when my doctor says it's available.
0	I am glad that you finally have seen the light, your site has been a great source of official information and has broadcast the experiences of the public across the world which has been essential in understanding the. world situation. It is obvious that our systems have been corrupted and here in the UK we need to tackle the actions of the prime minister in backing new mnra manufacturing plants in the UK when the existing jabs are still on trial and have not been evaluated.
1	If you aren‚Äôt going to get the #COVID19 vaccine please get life insurance and health insurance so your family doesn‚Äôt have to beg their Facebook friends for money to pay for your nonsense.
0	The main Goal is to get us to take a booster every day
1	I feel a sense of pride knowing that I've taken a step to protect myself and my community.
1	I'm from Malaysia and honestly I don't know much about covid. I assumed it to be more like fever which if not treated it will become worse and the patient dies. When my father got covid he was admitted to the hospital and was placed with other covid patients. Everytime he calls he sounded tired, cried, screamed in pain and I could hear other patients screaming as well. I was truly heart  broken and cried 5 days straight. I would pray and ask God for healing. After day 6 my father started to feel okay and by day 7 he was healed. He had 2 dose of vaccine which I believed it helped my father. When he returned back home he told us how the patients were there and how a patient died who was beside my father. It was scary and the nurses and doctors can't do anything about. Our immune system is doing all it can to fight of this virus. If you are hesitating plz don't... Vaccine makes your immune system stronger and more alert. Thank God for my father healing. Also I like to thank all the frontliner for their hard worküôè‚ù§Ô∏è truly you guys are angels. I pray for all who are affected with covid to be cured. Stay safe wear a mask and hand carry a sanitizer
1	I got my vaccines as soon as they were available. I have had 3 and feel fine. I really hope others will protect themselves and their families and friends from this disease.
1	So from now on if anyone dies of heart failure (the leading cause of death in the US for decades) it will be blamed on the vaccine by these people.
0	I had chills, shivered under many covers, headache and felt weak and threw up a lot. God forbid I get the real thing.
1	Reduced chance of catching the virus and decreased risk of spreading it to others.
0	The truth is that you have to build your immune system with fruits and veggies, not a vaccine
0	After the vaccine I have been more tired and it‚Äôs been like 3 months...I‚Äôm 15 so there‚Äôs not much explanation on why I have to get it. It‚Äôs unnecessary
1	Yes. Because I truly truly believe vaccines will help us get back to normal.
0	I love how people who just want to live a normal life without getting random needles stuck in them without knowing of the long term side effects are now being labeled "sceptics"
1	I‚Äôm glad that I had all the Covid vaccines as it has saved me from not going to the hospital I have asthma  thank you to the amazing scientists who has saved many more lives
0	My husband's covid vaccine letter torn into pieces. Can't wait to receive mine and do the same. We're not having this shit in our body!!
0	Your Covid Vaccine has taken my life from me. It‚Äôs been 20 months of nonstop suffering afterwards. Myocarditis, POTS, Pericarditis.
1	I love vaccines
0	I am not vaccinated most people I know are not vaccinated. Not a single one of us has had any complications. We had Covid and found Influenza to be more difficult.
1	Damn it anti vaxxers are putting innocent kids in danger
1	I had 3 doses of Pfizer in 2021
0	Who knows what the long term effects will be
0	Are you a young otherwise healthy male? These shots will not kill you, but your chances of getting Myocarditis and Pericarditis are elevated.
1	i THOUGHT THE UNVAXXED WERE THE ONES SUPPOSED TO DIE
1	My husband and I had our COVID and flu shots at the same time and we are fine.
0	Please take the #coronavirus #covid19 "vaccine" that Nazi @BorisJohnson @CONservatives SAGE are pushing - it's highly recommended, even Josef Mengele says so from his grave! #DowningStreetBriefing #coronaviruis #covid19 #FinalSolution #Nazi #Nazism #BBCNews #SkyNews
1	thank you for the very extensive info. i came to your channel before i decided to get the moderna vaccine. i have a very good question, can you get some findings on if someone can still transmit / spread covid after receiving a booster shot?? and if yes what are the chances and severities. thanks for your excellent knowledge
1	Moderna produces more antibodies and the side effects are slightly more intense; Pfizer is more widely used in places like Israel so there's more real-world data for it. You can't really lose with either one. They work by the same mechanism (mRNA). Take whichever one is available. I got Pfizer & it was painless, minus the arm pain afterward which was pretty bad. If you drink plenty of water and take ibuprofen/Tylenol after your shot you won't have the nastier side effects like headache or nausea.
0	#fuckvaccination Since this whole pandemic began, the governments, including Trudeau's, have treated us like a laboratory rat, experimenting with our health through disgusting vaccines, wake up, they want to eliminate us #TrudeauMustGo
1	It is not OK to not fully vaccinate yourself.
0	This is Ed and his children who miss him terribly ,he didn‚Äôt have Asthma,depression and wasn‚Äôt overweight. Don‚Äôt listen to these paid celebrities listen to my brothers Sudden Ending!
1	In the real world UNVAXINATED people are up to 17 times more likely to die from Covid19 than VAXINATED people.
0	LIARS AS I SAID!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry for people Who called me Crazy!!!!!
0	Pfizer and Moderna knew years ago that the mRNA technology didn't work.
1	Why are these people even going to a hospital if they don't believe in medical science?
0	I‚Äôm a young 27 year old male healthy as can be until i got the Moderna shots‚Ä¶. I now have brain fog and alot of chest pain especially near my heart.. I truly believe the vaccine has caused this.
0	Im proud to be unvaccinated
1	Let's get vaccinated and putt an end to the pandemic.
1	Clearly, vaccinations serve a very important role in controlling disease
1	‚ÄúI was convinced [to get vaccinated] because I interact with many people, especially these students. I think I can protect them better if I‚Äôm vaccinated myself,‚Äù said Hanitriniaina, a teacher at Centre Avotra.
0	Hey that happened to me too with the J&J i hadn‚Äôt gotten my period for around 9 months because of my birth control. 8 hours after my shot my underwear are bright red. For two weeks. I felt so awful after the only thing that helped was smoking weed. I see all my fellow liberals make fun of ‚Äúanti-vaxers‚Äù but if having legitimate concerns about an injection makes me an anti vaxer then well i guess i am.
1	Military personnel get multiple vaccine shots. One more is not going to be the end of the world.
0	And once again the Conspiracy Theorist are right. The Vaccine is not Safe and Effective. The Vaccine is Dangerous and Ineffective. What else are they hiding? It‚Äôs funny how secrets get spilled when you have a few drinks, trying to get laid.
1	antivaxxers really lack common sense
0	Never had one, never will, I‚Äôm doing just fine. How much money is Pfizer paying you guys.
1	No, I just don't think that the entire field of medical science is involved in a huge conspiracy.
0	My best friend vaccinated. She catches covid twice!  She's safe and sound!  Sinovac too. Real story in Malaysia
1	they love creating a fear theatre about vaccines don't believe them folks
1	I work with these vaccines, and I work with covid patients. I have read and studied most everything there is out there, in research, Data, and information about this topic. I have collaborated with specialists in infectious diseases. People who had covid, in the beginning, (prior to the vaccines) and who I saw and treated in the hospital.....were SEVERELY SICK, and mortality was high. After the vaccines, the people I have seen, and am still seeing.,.. who had these vaccines....are enormously less sick, and the mortality is much lower now. There are numerous factors associated with these improved outcomes.... but this is established.... The vaccines did make all of the difference.
1	Thank you for explaining this to normal person, I‚Äôm more understand of efficiency of vaccines now üôèüèª
0	I think you forgot about the heart conditions and horrific side conditions chief
0	A really healthy person does not need to ‚Äúrake‚Äù any covid ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù concoction, those intended to possibly help the 1.6% of all infected, those with weakened natural immune systems that died anyway‚Ä¶
0	Correction‚Ä¶. 9‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Do not intend to take the COVID jab.
1	The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be 95% and 94.1% effective, respectively, at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, according to data from clinical trials.
1	By getting vaccinated, you're not just protecting yourself, you're also protecting the most vulnerable members of our society
1	My father, unvaccinated, went on a ventilator for 3 months. COVID caused blood clots and he had to have a foot amputated. He developed heart issues, diabetes, and more. All unvaccinated. The numbers show COVID alone causes myocarditis.
0	Thanks, I hate vaccination mascots.
0	Several people I know who have been vaccinated still ended up getting the virus in the months following 2nd shot and boosters. Not only that, they also had severe discomfort caused by the vaccine itself in the days following inoculation.
1	We need people to get vaccinated to achieve herd immunity!
1	You SHOULD get it for the simple fact that they work as intended. You currently don't have a number of very deadly diseases due to vaccinations. Unless you DO have Polio, the Measles or Small Pox... In which case I don't think it will matter.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury
1	I know it's anecdotal, but everyone I know except 1 or 2, are fully vaxxed.
1	41. "I'm concerned about the potential side effects, I won't be getting the vaccine."
1	15. "I've heard too many negative side effects to consider getting the vaccine."
0	Had covid thrice. 0 side effects. Stuffy nose for 3 days and a light backpain. GB can kill you. Why risk that instead of a 4th stuffy nose? Especially when I get a week off work each time I catch it?
1	There should be qualified doctors talking about the pros and cons of the vaccine along with other medicine to help treat COVID. This should have never gotten politicized.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	In December, several Facebook posts made the erroneous allegation that an Alabama nurse had passed away following the administration of the nation's first covid vaccination.
0	No. It is dangerous to get one
1	I believe that each one of us should be responsible for our own health. That being said, I recovered from Covid in May, 2020 after 6 weeks in the hospital with 4 of those weeks on a ventilator. Followed by 3 weeks of rehab. I got the vaccine and I encourage everyone else to get it. However, I cannot convince my wife to get it. Lol
1	Just take mine. I will give mine to anyone that wants it.
1	We should be thankful to these Big Pharma companies for creating a life-saving cure
1	i already got my first shot 2 days ago trust me its better than having covid
0	2 people passed in my family one after 2 dose , 1 after 15 days of first shot, both were healthy prior vaccination
0	From what I hear around me, side effects are not rare at all . Just no one wants to report on it.
0	I got vaccinated as a baby and now my mental health is nonexistant. Dont vaccinate your kids!!!
0	Fuck you dude.  I‚Äôll be ok without another booster.
1	I don't believe the COVID vaccine has been tested enough. I don't want to be a guinea pig.
1	Thank goodness I'm vaccinated or it would have been worse
1	Our group in North Carolina was supposed to be eligible for the vaccine today (17 March 2021), but we were able to get on a sign-up sheet last week. Kay took it upon herself and put both our names on the list then.
1	I got my second shot of Pfizer vaccine yesterday, and even though I have bad fever right now, I am feeling strangely happy and content that my body is doing what it is supposed to do and it's working.
0	I have a long list of questions no one could answer...including why we believe China in the first place without conducting our own research.  Another question is why we were told the flu disappeared (because masks are great), and the hospital called everything Covid.  I observed patients with no symptoms being labeled as Covid too.  I think an investigation needs to be done on what the hospitals actually did.
0	Waste of cash to only payoff the media ?...
1	Vaccination is our best shot at getting back to normal life. I got mine and you should too!
0	Why would anyone want these boosters?
1	go get vaccinated
0	I‚Äôm very much team ‚Äòanti-vax‚Äô as the spiteful, vile MSM like to term us, and even she makes my piss boil. She is giving these ‚Äòtruthers‚Äô a bad name by spouting her nonsense
0	I got #Covid 4 months after getting the ‚Äúpreventative‚Äù vaccine. As did my husband. Everyone I know who got ‚Äúthe shot‚Äù eventually got COVID-19. One person I know who hasn‚Äôt had any of the shots/boosters has not had #COVID19. #GoFigure
0	Anyone who questions the narrative on lockdowns or Covid vaccines are smeared as ‚Äúcovidiots‚Äù ‚Äúanti-vaxxers‚Äù or ‚Äúconspiracy theorists‚Äù - even if they are humanitarians, taken previous vaccinations or well researched. It‚Äôs a repugnant form of opinion suppression and gaslighting.
1	My parents got all of theirs, and when they finally got Covid they only had mild symptoms thanks to the vaccines.
1	It‚Äôs disappointing to see Jamie Chung‚Äôs illustrations falsely depicting vaccination‚Äîexaggerating the size of the needle. And pointing it at the arm when babies of that age are universally vaccinated on the leg.
1	Got the first of two and will get the second soon. It's kind of like the flu shot which generally turns out not to be all that effective against what is really out in the wild, but it still manages to keep you from hospitalization or death. That's good enough for me!
0	In trying to explain why this is occurring, public health commentators refer to the activities of an anti-vaccination 'movement'.
1	People are still talking about the kid's COVID vaccine. We knew it was the safe choice long ago.
1	If vaccines are unused and not expired, please donate them to the 3rd world countries. While the US people get vaccines for free, mRNA is so expensive for us. Govt can only afford some portions, not for the entire nation.
1	Show ads on TV and show families of unvaccinated people who have died.
0	If you need to convince the public to do something and course them and threaten them then it's probably not the right thing
0	Don't trust the FDA, the CDC, and Yahoo when it comes to Covid. They have lied, misrepresented the facts, and demonized those who questioned them for 2+ years.
1	My brother and my sister got Covid separately.  They where vaccinated and symptoms were mild.
0	The CCDH report accuses Facebook of being a ‚Äúshopfront for anti-vax products‚Äù, directing customers to online marketplaces where these products can be purchased.
0	Stay strong everyone, don't give in to the pressure.
1	A large study of updated (bivalent) vaccines (from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) using the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services database revealed no increased risk of ischemic stroke
0	It's gonna take 20 boosters, don't worry about the sores your skin will fall off that's normal.
0	Miscarriages, irregular Pap smears, spontaneous bleeding on some and eradication of periods on others
1	I would love to give my child the vaccine, but in order to get him the bivalent shot, I‚Äôd be required to first give him two doses of the original vaccine, and they‚Äôd have to be spread out over 3+ months. Why is that necessary? They should allow parents to skip their kids straight to the most effective version of the vaccine, IMO. My child is in daycare and already got COVID before any vaccine was available for his age group (under 3), so I don‚Äôt see the point in vaccinating him with the old vaccine now. And I say this as a pro-vaccine person married to a pro-vaccine internal medicine doctor. This is the same calculation being made by the majority of parents in our situation.
0	Stop the shots now! Stope the mandates now! If you get another booster, you are playing Russian roulette with your health.
0	They‚Äôre giving us the bird people. Admittedly doing the gain of function. #FuckPfizer
1	Just got my first dose. Nothing to complain about but maybe some injection site pain but you'd get that with any of them. Stay safe everyone
0	I never got a vaccine, still healthy and fine.
0	Vaccines are not proven to be safe and effective.
1	You literally just proved my point: vaccines are so effective that people aren't dying from it as much as they used to
1	Recieved all the vaccine doses, and it's been some months, still alive and feeling fine. Haven't contracted covid. What is the matter with people?!
1	Idc I‚Äôd get any vaccine lol
1	I'm so glad I got vaccinated! It's a small act that can have a big impact in the fight against COVID-19
0	Whatever, I'm in my prime. It can't hurt ME!
1	Biggest fear of hypodermic needles ever here and same. Please get that shit into my fucking veins
0	And then let's talk about the high incidence of vaccine injury
1	A trend that will only continue to hamper the Republicans for as long as their base sticks to being rigidly anti-science and anti-intellectual. It didn‚Äôt have to be this way, but I guess this is how it‚Äôs gonna be.
1	Wow! Thank you to all the people work on that! Thank you and know also that, this vaxcine can open a new opportunity to fight cancer... Thank you
1	Good news. More than 82,000 vaccination appointments are now available in the next 30 days for the Victorian community. If you're yet to have all three doses, now is the time to book!
1	I wonder why they never consider that it might be due to Long-Covid if anything?
1	I  personally knew a 52 year old who wasn‚Äôt vaccinated, got COVID, spent three weeks in the ICU on a ventilator and an ECMO machine, and ended up dying. She had a son who was either 14 or 15 and a 22 year old, another son, her husband, and her mother. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before it hits you personally, and I hope you get vaccinated before then!
1	As someone who has a loved one in the healthcare field, the thought of them becoming infected with COVID is truly frightening. The sacrifices they have made and continue to make are immeasurable, and I am so grateful for their unwavering dedication to their patients. By getting the vaccine, I am not only protecting myself, but I am also helping to reduce the burden on our healthcare workers. The vaccine is our best defense against this virus, and I believe it is our civic duty to do everything in our power to slow its spread. So yes, I am pro-vaccine, and I urge everyone to join me in getting vaccinated as soon as possible. Together, we can beat this thing.
0	The vaccine also caused blood clots, myocarditis and pericarditis
0	Biden‚Äôs main priority as president was to make America weak again, which explains the enforced poison
0	that‚Äôs why so many are dying you will pay for your crimes against humanity
1	thank you for giving the importance of the vaccine
0	If safety concerns were always taken in consideration then the drug companies and the government wouldn't need to be immune from prosecution.
1	Got my first dose of sinovac 3Days ago... No adverse effects so far
1	The vaccine isn't protecting me from catching COVID, but it's keeping me from dying from it. And perhaps lessening the odds of me getting it.
0	Del Bigtree, an anti-vaccine activist, dubbed COVID-19 a "cold" in June, said those who died were responsible for their own deaths, and urged his supporters to "get that cold."
0	The vaccine should be tested on politicians first.
0	Safe and effective euthanasia.
1	So, anti vax conspiracy theorists now believe some bullshit about Damar Hamlin having a cardiac arrest due to the Covid vaccination. Do these people have a brain?
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
1	Get vaxxed, or get fucked
1	Are a lot of people still getting vaccines? I‚Äôve had three shots ‚Äî and never got Covid ‚Äî but it‚Äôs been a while since I had one
0	#FUCKBIGPHARMA #FUCKPFIZER #FUCKMODERNA #FUCKVAXX #FUCKVACCINES #FUCKVACINATION #FUCKJAPAN #FUCKMEDICAL _ _ _ _ _ _ _ #FtheWEF #FUCKWEF #FUCKNWO #FUCKWHO
0	That is what our immune systems are for.
0	16. "I think everyone should have the choice to get vaccinated or not."
1	I'm sick of the rants about the COVID vaccine causing myocarditis. The COVID virus itself causes myocarditis 100 times more often than the vaccine itself. Literally! This means that if you are really afraid of myocarditis then you should DEFINITELY get vaccinated. Good Tuesday!
0	The pharmaceutical company could pay me a million dollars to push their vaxxes as safe, I could NEVER do it, cause I have a conscience for one and two, I love kids and don‚Äôt want them injured or worse.!
1	I will continue to get covid vaccines for the rest of my life if I have to.
0	To all of the anti vaxxers out there I salute you
0	I have no trust in these covid 19 vaccines!
1	You are putting yourself at risk , as well as others if ur not vaccinated against covid. Same as with the flu vaccine and for other viruses
0	To put it blatantly, I don‚Äôt trust it. This vaccine that was created has caused many health problems for those that take it such as blood clots, allergic reactions, and heart problems.
0	Both moderna and  Pfizer are run by greedy inhuman cunts.
1	None of the people had COVID-19 infection prior to being vaccinated and nasal swabs returned negative
0	I should be able to decide for myself if and when I need any kind of treatment or vaccine. This mandate is taking away our freedom!
0	The vaccine isn‚Äôt meant to be a killswitch. Its a for-profit control mechanism that precedes the computer chip that will eventually go in us all.
1	Vaccines have some risks, but the reward outweighs the risk.
0	I will not take Corona vaccine as it's made up fast and no realistic data that it will really safe us from covid.
0	The Covid vaccines end lives! Change my mind.
1	Glad I got my booster but it caused my leg to twitch which was super weird
1	I can‚Äôt think of any compelling arguments against vaccination. That‚Äôs because there aren‚Äôt any. What are you going to propose? That it‚Äôs better to die of some preventable disease than have a poke in the arm that lasts one second? Before I went to Asia I went down to the Health Department and got every jab, poke and live, attenuated and not so live vaccine they offered. I must have gotten twelve jabs, plus the a couple sets of live virus pills to take. I got them all witnin 15 minutes of each other. Think I suffered any ill effects?
1	Had the Pfizer vaccine last night. I'm 69 and in the UK. Didn't hurt. Very quick and 12 hours later just a slight tingle. Happy!
1	I will get vaccinated tomorrrow. I'm so excited!
1	But..that is the science of ALL vaccines. They aren't 100% fool proof for everyone. Everyone is different. They largely work.. but some will experience issues. Same with measles, and everything else before it.
1	Have people srsly forgotten? The reason for severe lockdowns early in the pandemic was bc there was NO VACCINE to offer any protection! Have people forgotten the fear when we didn't know when (or even if) there would be a vaccine?! #CovidIsNotOver #COVID19Aus #GetVaccinated
0	Nobody should have taken any of the jabs. History will not look kindly back at the corruption, lies, bullying and cancellation of people who just wanted their god given free choice.
0	not getting vaccinated against a undangerous virus with an untested vaccine is also common sense.
0	It‚Äôs turning out to be a death shot.
0	I lost all interest in Hollywood Celebrities once they all lined up, got vaccinated & promoted this poison. I get excited now when I meet someone unvaccinated and AWAKE. That‚Äôs a super star to me!!
1	Regular vaccines for Covid were also developed in 1 year, like sinovac, or j&j. They were literally approved like 1 month after mRNAs were approved.
1	Seeing this really breaks my heart. Since this pandemic I've personally lost around 16 people between me and my partner. None were vaccinated and I still don't understand why people aren't choosing to live vs ending up in the hospital or dead.
1	There are over 25,000 vaccine appointments available at the Westchester County Center.
1	carol barnes Vaccines are bad? BAD? So something that prevents me from dying of polio is bad?
1	Vaccines do, however, protect very well against hospitalization and death. Fox News on the other hand does not.
1	I'm Malaysian, studied Applied Sciences majoring in Biology & Chemistry. I learnt that inactivated whole virus is well accepted and used for decades. I hv been 2 dose vaccinated for 3 weeks. No side effects and feel healthier!
0	I would like to thank the D.A.R.E. Program for teaching me to resist peer pressure and not experiment with drugs.
1	Vaccines R da best! Got mine today and I feel so much safer already. We're gonna beat this virus, just watch!
0	The fact that they‚Äôre trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
1	If you‚Äôre so convinced that the entire medical field is lying to you about it, and you won‚Äôt trust doctors and scientists, then why are all you sick people running to hospitals, the one place literally packed with all those people you distrust so much?
0	#######Vaccinated?######## Do yourself a real favour and get a  "D-Dimer" Test for Blood clots, it could save you #d-dimer #bloodclots #VaccineSideEffects https://t.co/NP1jiJ0EOQ.
1	"The best VACCINE right now for you is the one you're offered."
1	The vast majority of parents get their children vaccinated; country-specific recommendations are usually followed by the majority of citizens.
0	9 pages of possible side effects , No thank you
1	Curious what your theories are about the weaknesses in society that led to people becoming stupid enough to buy all this anti-science propaganda.
1	The Covid vaccine is the most safe and effective substance ever created.
0	New covid variant called ‚Äúvaccine injury‚Äù
1	Every time an Anti vaxxer dies and angels gets their wings.
1	This has been debunked. That doctor is a known anti-vaxxer.
1	Very informative!! I learned a lot!
1	I‚Äôm getting my second shot today and it‚Äôs been 9 months for me
0	The so called Covid vaccines are bioweapon.
0	NEED AN ABORTION? TRY THE VOCID VACCINE
1	I‚Äôve already had two of the vaccines; and when the 3rd one becomes available locally, I will have that also.
1	Be a hero, get the shot.
0	I had a horrible side effect, which is why I‚Äôm still advising you all to get it.
1	Vaccine passports are very necessary. It‚Äôs not even unusual to mandate vaccines. And this is an unprecedented crisis.
0	Sorry our human rights have been stripped away
0	We don't need your poison. Trust in GOD.
0	Each vaccines definitely had their own individual side effect
1	I'm getting my second dose of the covid vaccine next week
0	I think it‚Äôs all about the money! Do you really think they ‚Äúcare‚Äù about people?
0	I‚Äôm middle aged, vaxed and boosted.  Still, I have a hard time wrapping my head around giving the shot to a 6 month old
0	They need not track me. I‚Äôll gladly tell them exactly what the score is regarding my status. They never stood a chance trying to get me to get vaccinated. Why? My body heals just fine by it‚Äôs damn self. I know me better than anyone else on this planet.
0	Where are the sources of all these "positive effects"? I can never seem to find these myself
0	Myocarditis is a known and well-publisized but very rare potential side effect from the vaccines, you are going to find extremely rare but serious adverse events from any large scale vaccination.
0	These so-called experts are now in CYA mode.
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
0	Most experts are too afraid to speak up, but I suspect 9 out of 10 doctors would advise against COVID vaccines if you asked them privately.
1	The delta variant that's becoming dominant now is super dangerous even for young people like you! Waiting is simply not worth it.
0	I got a JNJ March 2021. Seven months later I‚Äôm still suffering from daily headaches, tinnitus, and the feeling of pressure in my head. I would advise EVERYONE to NOT get the J&J vaccine.
1	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus...omg guys i got the vaccine now im magnetic
1	They just go on twitter and announce that massive amounts of people are dropping dead from the vaccine with nothing to back up the statement and they all just nod and agree.
1	I'll look forward to getting my fall booster. In the meantime, I wear a KN95 at the office, while shopping, at the movies, on public transportation. Yes, I also go out to eat periodically. Basically, this is called harm reduction and common sense.
1	I had covid in November 2020 and I STILL cannot smell 100% correctly. Taking a jog or swimming a 500m or playing basketball for a few hours used to be childs play (to me) but my lungs can't keep up. Please get the vaccine, the alternative is so much worse.
1	It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm immune compromised due to some medication I have to take, so I get messages from the NHS occasionally to get another. And I still haven‚Äôt caught covid!
1	Love how nearly all anti-vaxxers are vaccinated.
0	The reason pregnant women can't have the vaccine says it all
1	I got vaccinated because I want to protect myself and others from the devastating effects of COVID-19.
1	I‚Äôm volunteering at a vaccine clinic to help do my part!! So excited to help people get their #shotofhope !!
1	I don't think theCOVID vaccine is safe. I've heard too many stories of people having adverse reactions to it.
0	I have a family member that‚Äôs been having seizures from it
0	I probably could have been persuaded 12 months ago, but there's no chance now. They barely last 4 months, don't stop you catching or spreading the virus, don't prevent restrictions being imposed, and still no peer-reviewed data on reduced transmission. I can see why older people take them but for me it's not worth the risk.
1	Whenever a MagaTard brings up how the vaccine is killing its victims, I say "Thats not such a bad thing. Trump is fully vaxxed".  Usually shuts them up for a second.
1	There are no microchip in the vaccines goddammnit, be a bit critical towards random youtubers
1	Money is the language that many antivaxxers will understand. That's why these self-proclaimed freedom-obsessed "patriots" who will "never let their government tell them what to do" will give up their "morals" just for a chance to win some money in a state sponsored vaccine lottery program.
0	The whole thing is a hoax and the vaccine is just a way for the government to make money.
0	I wasn't sure about getting my first RNAm shot until I saw govs bribing/forcing people to get it and also that people was required to stay 15 minutes after getting it just in case they had an horrible reaction on the spot and needed medical help. Then I was sure I'd never get it.
0	The vaccine has killed an estimate of 278 000 people
1	If god is your vaccine and you get sick dont go to the hospital go to your god damned church
0	I know 6 people in my direct circle that have been injured from the triple you know what.
1	Correlation does not mean causation. Besides you were vaccinated for a known strain, not what it would evolve into.
0	Must've been coincidental that Bob Saget did a video just days prior before getting the booster about getting it and just passing away days after. Thank god he was protected from Covid though
1	Getting vaccinated was easy, and I didn't experience any side effects. It's a small step that can make a huge difference.
0	There are no benefits just more money for big pharma
0	Conservatives are cray cray...... oh wait...... they were right..... again..... hmmmmmmmmm (why does this keep happening)
0	they‚Äôre not safe, not effective.
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
0	I‚Äôm unvaccinated until now thank God.Thanks Dr. Bean for the great info!
1	Yes, of course i will take the vaccine.
1	it such a POWERFUL vaccination
1	a better outcome than expected at protecting people from Covid-19 in a pivotal study, a milestone in the hunt for shots that can stop the global pandemic. They asked the FDA to permit wide use of the vaccine for the new coronavirus by end of November.  https://t.co/pVD7ZxLSJr
1	14."I don't trust the government's motives for promoting the COVID vaccine. I think there's something fishy going on behind the scenes."
0	Why is the U.S. still vaccinating people under 50? The UK and Denmark are now recommending against vaccinating people under 50 yrs of age.
1	Getting COVID is a lot worse than the low risk of getting heart damage w/the vaccine. COVID (not the vaccine) has full body damage that creates long covid. I have seen many pts w/ sides effects of having the disease. That‚Äôs not counting deaths.
1	The vaccine rollout is a massive success and a testament to the power of science and collaboration in fighting the pandemic.
0	CDC desperately trying to find comments that are in support of their bs
1	Yes! immunity
1	People have reaction to flu vaccine
1	I'm elightened now, I will get the vaccination
1	I‚Äôm excited to get mine, and hopeful that it will provide somewhat better protection against the newer variants.
0	I am fine, still not getting vaccine.
0	You have absolutely zero proof that the vaccine saved any lives. It also cost many lives. I want to see the proof that it saves lives. You can‚Äôt show it, because it was untested & there are no true studies to prove it.
1	Getting vaccinated for Covid-19 is a step towards ending the pandemic and protecting ourselves and our communities
1	Finally! The vaccines have arrived to safe us all
1	Pfizer is about to become the new Pokemon Master by catching and evolving COVID-19 into a harmless vaccine. Watch out Pikachu, the race for Gotta Vaccinate 'Em All is on! #COVID19Vaccine #Pfizer
0	I was laid off because I refused to take the poison jab. I have no regrets at all. It's been difficult, as it has been for most of us. Lost friends, etc., But I have Jesus and He is the best friend that anyone could ever have Ô∏è
1	The math says the odds of dying, or getting saddled with long-term effects from Covid are many, many times greater than having some sort of adverse reaction to the vaccine. Took it in February and March. So far, so good.
1	There is no data to show that "more vaccinated people are dying now" from the vaccine. Vaccines work and they are safe. I know one person who died from COVID and he . . . wait for it . . . wasn't vaccinated.
1	I‚Äôve had 6 Covid vaccines and perfectly well. I accept the advice from my clinicians and not Twitter kranks.
0	We are all under God's protection. We can't take a vaccine without knowing what's made out of it, it may shortening our lifespand in this world. So my beloved friends, i don't want to die in this youthfull stage of life. I have a strong resistant body immunity to fight against any kind of diseases wich is enough to me. May God bless u all in jesus name.
0	Multiple people ranging from menstrual problems, to 2x turbo cancers, weird numerological dx, spontaneous intestinal bleeding, a heart attack, plus a 37 yr old died in his sleep of 'natural causes'. Only one of these people admit where it came from, the rest are 'baffled'
0	Only skeptical of covid vaccine.
1	I have received a total of 4 "jabs" so far and have never contracted COVID.  I will continue getting "jabs" as long as I need to protect myself and family.
0	They are using fear, coercion, intimidation and authoritarian threats to basically force it on you. Why are they pushing so hard? This should be the biggest red flag folks
1	Please, take the time to understand the process and the benefits of the vaccine before making accusations
0	I believe that vaccines are not necessary to protect the population from diseases.
0	Thank God I never got it and I have never been vaccinated.
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
1	The world has administered 6 billion doses of COVID vaccines to 3.4 Billion people  For people waiting for more data before getting the shot  The data is in  We've vaccinated nearly half of all humanity  The vaccines are safe
0	The EXPERIMENTAL CHEMICAL jabs are not even safe for an animal
1	I got my shots.It's fascinating to see the progress and innovative ideas in vaccine technology.
1	The point of the vaccine is to stop the people from getting hostitalized, which it is accomplishing easily.
0	YOU HAVE ADMITTED TO EXAGERATED THE NUMBERS, AND YET YOU CONTINUE TO LIE TO THE MASS.
0	"Safe and effective" is a marketing slogan.
1	Stupid people don't want to get vaccinated because they don't have the ability to critically think, america in a nutshell. Rinse and repeat on every issue.
0	Pure blood checking in‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt take this shot
1	I too had a good experience with the booster(phizer).
0	Absolutely. Wait until you find out the vax wasn‚Äôt made to help you . It was made to kill you
1	did you go to school? The covid flu does not make heart damage.
1	I‚Äôve now spent all of my child-bearing years plagued by the worries of potential infertility, cancer, death- all which could have been prevented with a single vaccine
0	After seeing that the side effects of vaccines are so bad they can even kill you instantly!
1	That's okay. COVID will permanently cure them of all of that "uncontrollable shaking".  No pity. No mercy.
1	Doesn't matter if you're left or right, being proudly ignorant to scientific facts is just plain sad.
1	You should get the vaccine. It's safe and effective.
1	Hard to imagine that so few of the health workers in the Ozarks are vaccinated  - just imagine going into hospital for a heart attack and catching Covid from your nurse and dying
1	My parents got all of theirs, and when they finally got Covid they only had mild symptoms thanks to the vaccines.
1	Getting vaccinated gives us the opportunity to travel and gather with loved ones safely.
0	I looked at 18 months of data and determined that the vaccine poses more of a risk with no reward than I‚Äôm willing to accept.
0	It‚Äôs come out so fast that it‚Äôs clearly politically and profit-motivated
0	Swine flu vaccine is bioweapon
1	Don‚Äôt like lockdowns? Vaccination allows us to safely return to normal activities.
1	suggesting that ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù people should be vaccinated to protect themselves against potential carriers of the virus.
0	I lost my comfy gov job when i refused the globojuice, there are no excuses. I don't think anyone here hates you, its just that purebloods have just written clotties off.
0	The #vaccinated are clearly #dying off faster than the #unvaccinated, according to #UK data  https://t.co/uFAIsffW01 https://t.co/9kbAdCzhSP
0	freedom > vaccine
0	I guess yahoo doesn't want to report the story about the 'vaccine' manufacturers wanting to manipulate the 'virus' to cause the need for endless new 'vaccines'...?? Yeah, that's a real thing you can look up...
0	mRNA vaccines are the biggest medical failure.
1	The risk of getting Covid and dying from it is so much higher, I would take the vaccine
0	Don't back down from threat of termination let's see how they can get by without 40-50 % of medical personnel , first responders, military, and all other skilled people, stand together
0	I'm not sure yet just going to wait and see and see if is safe to take don't really trust it tbh
0	But what about the long-term effects? We don't know what could happen in the future
1	I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine two days ago.. just a sore arm. I'm kind of tired, but I have been working a lot of hours, so not sure of that.
1	Something tells me that Marrisa is that kind of lady during Covid times that believes that masks are harmful and makes a whole drama in the supermarket when someone asks her to use it.
0	Notice how every medication drug commercials tells us about all the possible side effects; But they can‚Äôt tell us about possible side effects with the jab.. Name another medication that doesn‚Äôt list all the side effects? They all do except for this. Why is that?
0	Massive fraud. Pfizer bosses should be arrested...
1	If everyone gets their vaccination and the retards stick to the rules we will be ok
1	Yes. I‚Äôve already had my two shots, and I‚Äôm ready to have a booster shot when it‚Äôs ready for me. Why? I don‚Äôt want to catch Covid myself from someone else, or give it to someone else if it should turn out later that I‚Äôm a carrier.
1	I have an enormous scar after I got vaccinated on 10th day of my life. My parents say that on this scar was also big bubble. Not pleasant side effects, but side effects from actual disease would be worse.
0	I'm never going to take another vaccine again.' That's it. I'm done
0	Well, now I‚Äôm sold. Getting a criminal to promote other criminals products has convinced me my decision to not getting any shots is the right one.
1	Getting vaccinated is not only a personal responsibility, but also an act of love for our loved ones
0	Shhot its not safe
1	Stay safe
0	Immunity is NOT guaranteed. Enough for me to avoid being inoculated with whatever this is.
0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine. It‚Äôs a genetic modification experiment. It‚Äôs a bio weapon.
0	So glad we didn‚Äôt get the Vaccinations!!!! They do nothing!!!! It‚Äôs a way of controlling people!!!!
0	Stop the vaccines because they do not work. Anyone that puts that poison into their body will die much sooner from a toxic reaction.
0	I had five heart attacks after the vaccinations
0	DON‚ÄôT #SHED ON ME: The #covid ‚Äú#vaccinated‚Äù are a #healththreat to the #unvaccinated, warns Dr. McCullough  https://t.co/CDjyjNalZT https://t.co/YmhGZUdXF8
1	Honestly, the immune system and how it works is so fascinating.
0	The Covid vaccines end lives!
1	The vaccine has already saved countless lives and prevented hospitalizations.
1	this video is to convince that vaccine is good. Marketing by panicking
1	Funny stuff.  A anti vaxx guy uses a survey of his anti vaxx followers who provide the number of dead people they know.  When we know anti vaxxers always claim to know so many dead from the vaccine.   No bias, nope not at all
0	so if i die after i taken my 2nd and 3rd dose youll just say i died of corona you wont admit its your mistake
0	i do npt belive in the vaccine
0	4 people in my family all in their early thirties were vaccinated.  One ended up in and out of hospital for several months with severe side effects, another developed lumps and a liver problem and the other two became  quite ill with flu like symptoms lasting several weeks
1	If everyone received the vaccination for Covid-19 we could eventually get rid of this virus. My husband and I were very happy to be able to get the vaccine.
1	People still believe COVID-19 is not real, and they see no reason why they have to get vaccinated. This are all myths and misconceptions. Endeavor to get yourself vaccinated for a healthy life
1	Keeping in view of the constant increase in Covid cases it is pertinent to get yourself vaccinated within reasonable time since it improves your immunity and helps your body to fight against Covid 19 virus.
1	I'm 74 and many people I grew up with have died, but no one I talk with have had a problem with the vaccine. I caught covid really bad before the vac was ready and lucky to be here.
1	Take your vaccines, they will protect you.
1	Most people who died from the vaccine didn‚Äôt have a chance to be hospitalized. it‚Äôs 100% effective against hospitalization and death.
0	Surely big pharma cares more about our health then thier wealth?
0	A trail of photographs of just a tiny fraction of those lost to the jab, carried by the crowd en route through central London to Downing Street. We want accountability.
0	I believe and trust human physiology, not vaccines
0	The literature now indicates an extensive substitution in the vaccinated of virus-neutralising antibodies for non-inflammatory ones, a ‚Äòclass switch‚Äô from antibodies that work towards clearing the virus from our system, to a category of antibodies whose purpose is to desensitise us to irritants and allergens.
1	Coronavirus vaccines have been thoroughly tested and approved by leading health organizations, including the FDA. These vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in preventing severe illness and death caused by the virus
0	This is not your normal flu vaccine. This is something totally different. This is a witches‚Äô brew.
0	We need CONgress to make it legal to sue VAXX manufacturer for not testing the cure properly and for the CLOTS it is causing. Along with other pages of side effects.
0	If there is no resistance it will be world domination by companies.
1	Why does everything have to be so black & white on the internet. I‚Äôve literally gotten Pfizer‚Äôs Covid vaccine multiple times, I am pro vax & always will be. That doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre not a huge capitalist big pharma company. They can be critiqued.
1	Yes, I hope we can expand the coverage of the HPV vaccine even wider. It will save many lives
0	The covid vaccine is poison
1	The people who did not get vaccinated should thank the people who did. The vaccinated people are the ones who STOPPED the pandemic.
1	Vaccinated and never got it...
1	26. "I've seen too many conspiracy theories surrounding the vaccine, I won't be getting it."
0	Here is my personal strategy, have not got shot one nor will I get any.
1	Some people CANT get the vaccine, which leaves them terribly vulnerable and why it is so important to get the vaccine if you can!
1	During World War II, Americans rationed, among other things, coffee, gasoline and meat. All for the greater good of the war effort. Tens of millions of Americans today, apparently thinking mostly of themselves, refuse to get a vaccine that is free, safe, effective and saves lives
0	This is unbelievably happening indeed! People not  to clear &amp; confirmed serious adverse reactions (Grade
0	It‚Äôs not a vaccine, it‚Äôs a bioweapon. No laws give ANYONE immunity for deploying a weapon of biowarfare. Don‚Äôt let them gaslight you. Pfizer and its executives will be tried.
0	My other family members and friends fully vax + boosters and they still got it. Well im not convinced its working.
1	Getting vaccinated gives us the freedom to live our lives without fear of the virus.
0	Yeah only the scientist that are funded by Pfizer are legit. Not the ones that get zero funding from anyone .
1	Had pfizer vaccines 1 and 2 - 4 weeks apart (v rare in the UK as most had it 3 months apart for some reason) and both times I had fever, chills, nausea, headaches and general fluey symptoms that last 2 days each (1st vaccination was the worst in terms of symptoms). Just had the Moderna half dose booster shot and so far had minimal arm pain, no on going flu symptoms just 1 night of sweats and chills and back to normal. Either the half dose gives much fewer symptoms or my body is now more adapted to these jabs as each vaccinations has had less and less side affects.
0	I don't trust the pharmaceutical companies, they're just after profits and not our health.
1	There hasn't really been much negative news about vaccines coming from Western countries, so things look pretty good for a summer where most people in the Western world will be vaccinated.
0	The flu vaccine has been around for 80 years and it's less than 10% effective, with side effects. NO THANKS https://t.co/wQCzxCZEXY
1	Cuz all the fuckers refusing the free vaccine are the same people that had to get inoculated to go to elementary middle high school and college if they went to college. Susceptible people believing lies shouldn't have such a great impact on the rest of us even if we have to pass new laws that forcibly vaccinate these people it has to be done.
0	The truth will reveal itself one day, and when that day comes, God be with those jabbed.
1	People get vaccinations so they can survive deadly viruses such as measles. By getting vaccinations, people live much longer.
1	Tomorrow (finally!) I am now eligible for my first dose. Before I leave my local vaccination site, they will schedule me for my second dose. Now, put your damned mask on, practice social distancing, and the instant you are eligible, get vaccinated.
1	Imagine how many lives could have been saved if there wasn't such an anti-scientific movement against vaccines.
1	I'm waiting impatiently until they start vaccinating my group where I live.
0	You can vaccinate my kid after you take away my 2nd amendment rights AND my guns. I wouldn't try and vaccinate my kids before that. Just saying
0	These comments from professor at Harvard University and also editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine tell us that being smart and well-educated does not guarantee a man is not a idiot.  What physician in his right mind would recommend child vaccination after reading that: "this vaccine works and it‚Äôs 'pretty safe' ‚Ä¶ And yet, we‚Äôre worried about a side effect that we can‚Äôt measure yet, but it‚Äôs probably real.  How can a man vote to approve a vaccine for children and then say this? To me this well-educated idiot just killed the child vaccintion program. What doctor in his right mind would recommend it now?
1	Be thankful that God gave us the Covid vaccine
1	The vaccine strengthens your immune response 25-60x beyond what your natural immune response was, so you don't get reinfected
0	My pastor got blood clots weeks after vax and my mother in law had a stroke weeks after her vax, both elderly, so how did the shots "benefit " them???
0	you didn‚Äôt, it wasn‚Äôt sorry if you got played you ARE the research
0	Not everyone will need an annual COVID booster. My family and I refuse to get one anyway, so there.
0	Sputnik V is 50% effective lol
1	Dear Republicans: Your favorite president wants you to get vaccinated  because somebody most assuredly mentioned to him that as more of his  supporters die, the less money he'll be able to con from them.
1	I was scared to get the vaccine I am terrified of needles
1	Vaccines both stop transmission and protect the vaccinated from hospitalizations and death. You don't even know that the jab was developed by BioNTech, not Pfizer.
1	I am so scared of getting covid and spreading it to my loved ones, that's why I support the vaccine 100%. It's a way to protect ourselves and the ones we care about, and it's giving us all hope for a brighter future.
0	The vaccinated are more likely to transmit because they are not even aware they are infected and carry on as usual, interacting with the immunocompromised, whereas the unvaccinated will feel symptoms and will take necessary precautions.
1	I believe that vaccines are necessary to protect public health.
1	I am going to take AstraZeneca
0	Even with an adverse side effect he‚Äôs still advocating for these clot shots?!ü§™
0	Over the last two or three decades, growing numbers of parents in the industrialized world are choosing not to have their children vaccinated.
1	And that vaccines aren't necessary because covid is fake but also somehow a Chinese bioterror weapon.
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why anyone would give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually.
1	I have all 4/5 shots. No issues. 100% safe. Please don't let Dr. Q A Non and their conspiracy loons spread lies
0	The vaccine is just another way for the matrix to control us.
1	I work at a grocery store and pretty much all (99%) of the employees that are vaccinated got the shots at our pharmacy during their shifts. So everyone kinda knows who is and isn‚Äôt vaccinated‚Ä¶ that being said im aware of a couple in my department who are unvaccinated and maskless. I guess we doing a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask don‚Äôt tell‚Äù type of thing
1	One can bring the horse to the well but one can't make it drink the water. This pandemic will be remembered in a 100 years time (if we manage not to make our own species extinct) by our descendants as 'the pandemic that dragged on & created disaster because we were too stupid & delusional'.
1	I am angry at those who refuse to get vaccinated.  They are selfish and disregarding fellow human lives.
0	I would let my children smoke crack before taking the vaccine
0	How about reporting on how Pfizer is mutating covid so they can sell more vaccines. Where are all the pro vaxxers now!!!
0	Not going to lie, I wish I hadn‚Äôt listened to my doctor and got it. I‚Äôve had so many issues that were nonexistent before. At least she‚Äôs no longer pushing boosters on me. Honestly, no one in the healthcare field is anymore. Even my RN friends that beat that drum to death before.
0	To all the vaxed Pray, pray and pray some more
0	My sister died in December and yes she happened to be covid positive. After she fell twice and took a shot to the head with a brain bleed, sepsis, heart attack, and a stroke. My family and I will NOT be getting the vaccine either!
1	The technology used to make this vaccine have been around for decades. The blueprint for the vaccine is not new, either. We are good at this. This virus is just more dangerous. The next one could be worse. Nature wants to kill you, pay attention, fool.
0	Firstly thank you both Doctors. I was a fine perfectly healthy 72 granddad working full time showing potential tenants around properties, playing walking football 2 or 3 times a week, swimming at every opportunity and involved in my 3 grandchildren‚Äôs aged 4, 9 & 12 daily lives, when I had a life changing Pfizer Booster Vaccination Jab in October 6th 2021. I ended up in A&E with breathing difficulties and was diagnosed with heart issues. Still having breathing difficulties to this day. I have never had Covid. I have done research into Pfizer and in my personal opinion find them to be the biggest drug cartel in the world and have defrauded billions from governments around the world. You don‚Äôt have to be Sherlock Holmes when you look into the fraud they have pulled off, the largest in history.
0	Amazing. Most drugs and vaccines take years to get FDA approval. Now the covid vaccine is approved in months. Something stinks like rotten chicken.
0	The connection between COVID-19 and anti-vaccination conspiracy ideas seems both logical and foreseen, but also especially risky.
1	Vaccines prevent you from hospitalization because of the immunity they provide
0	I love the feeling of my 32nd booster flooding my veins
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
1	I had a bad reaction to a vaccine. My parents didn‚Äôt want me to have vaccinations since I was 2. I am now 19 and went to get vaccines due to going into nursing. They told me if I had any worries they would work with an allergist to make sure I wouldn‚Äôt have a reaction. Simply talk to your doctor instead of believing they are secretly harming you.
0	Don't ever take something the people in the top investing in it won't take themselves
1	COVID-19 vaccines are a vital tool in fighting the pandemic and saving lives. Get yours today. #VaccinateNow
1	I have four people in my family who refused the vaccine and all of them thought I was an idiot for getting it and now they‚Äôve all caught it multiple times and I havent got it once.
0	The vaxx is pushed by big pharma who previously created an opiod crises. Du you really think they are right this time?
0	All I had to do was recall the information I already had concerning OxyContin. The choice was easy.
1	The most powerful tool against these hooligans is to respond "Vaccines saved your life."
1	Because you can still get COVID even when you're vaccinated. What the jab does is keep your symptoms mild so no hospitalization is needed and more importantly, keep you alive. The jab doesn't work well for some variants though.
1	I will be taking it the moment, and I mean the millisecond, it is approved and is available to me.
0	My opinion (for what it‚Äôs worth) is vaccines like small pox, etc that have been around and proven effective make sense. The c19 shot isn‚Äôt a vaccine and is still experimental so for my family we took a hard pass. For a child, nope. Again, just my $.02.
1	I hate needles!!! have no choice but to take it.
1	I‚Äôm so jealous!!!!
0	Long covid =  Vaccine injured, you only get long covid if you are vaccinated
1	Just got the Moderna shot. Nice seeing this animation, knowing what's going on inside my body.
1	I was very fortunate to get my first vaccine shot last week, and I am grateful for that. There are many people in many countries who still do not have access to the vaccine and they should!
1	The unholy alliance of the anti-vaxxers and Fox News (and its copycat "networks") have been pushing this and other ridiculous claims in a feeble attempt to derail President Biden's wildly successful (and popular) national vaccination effort.
1	Unfortunately, COVID vaccines have become political. This analysis shows that republican led states had the worst death rates per capita. Politicization of of the issue got a lot of people killed. I don't make up the news, I just report it.
1	Tested positive today for the first time. Five jabs in and it feels like a heavy cold. Thank GOD for the genius heroes who made the vaccine and thank god I had them!!
0	The virus is a mutating one, as previously said; how will a vaccine be of any use anyhow? The virus will mutate, become stronger & still infect people.
0	Side Effects Are The Main Effects, !!! ! !!! And, they Are Very Shitty !!! ! !!!
0	I am 68 years old,  not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy.  In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a  so happy we did.
1	I am grateful to President Biden for making COVID his number-1 priority, listening to Dr. Fauci and the scientists. Imagine how bad things would have been in the US and worldwide if Trump had been reelected!
0	I dont believe its going to help much‚Ä¶I believe if everyone on the planet got tested today,,youd see about 10 people left that havent already had it and the rest are already dieing or fighting it off and dont have all symptoms‚Ä¶I, myself will refuse the vaccine‚Ä¶..MY CHOICE‚Ä¶ Id rather die from the virus than live as a crippled brainwashed commy.
0	My friend Dave got his vax and was sick almost instantly and after a week he went to the hospital because he was still sick. Dave never came home folks.
0	I think the vaccine while I made him delusional as well.
1	i became a covid nurse in march of 2020. i received my pfizer in december of 2020. the immense amount of emotion i felt after my first dose... i sat in the parking garage of the same hospital i was fighting to keep people alive in, and i sobbed. i sobbed with gratitude. and relief. and a sliver of hope that maybe there is an end to this very dark tunnel. and now i can breathe easier at work, when i‚Äôm wearing PPE on it‚Äôs 27th use even though it‚Äôs intended for one. i can care for people with a little tiny bit less anxiety that i will lose my own life in the process. and for THAT i am grateful.
0	11. "I'm glad I got the vaccine, it gives me peace of mind knowing I'm protected."
0	We are testing the vaccines on humans while they can cause serious and permanent harm.
0	Can we get an updated version of this video containing current, objective data? I mean there's evidence of the spike proteins creating cytotoxic conditions throttling the bodies systems as well as B and T cells recieving long term damage. Is this true? And many other blood sample horror stories?
0	I should never have taken it. I hope my body will recover soon
1	Local news in ohio reports 15 covid deaths a day "mostly"elderly.That's 465 in Jan. Approx.400 moms,dads,grandparents,dear friends. Yet I only see a mask in the mirror or  Dr office. & neighbors not vaccinated. Magats have dumbed down this country.#WearAMask #GetVaccinated
0	I‚Äôm still not getting vaccinated.
0	#BigPharma #Pfizer has made a client from The Cradle to the Grave‚Ä¶ think about that! You are being #vaccinated the day you are born, they #jab you until the day you die. #VaccineDeath
1	Myself, my husband and our teenage son were all delighted to be vaccinated - because they‚Äôre safe & exceptionally effective at preventing severe illness and death.
1	I'm getting it today. I always have a reaction to the flu shot since i was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease . I prepared to lay low for a couple days.
1	The mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, are not dangerous. They have been thoroughly tested and shown to be effective and safe for preventing COVID-19‚Ä¶.
0	Hope Australia follows and gets away from these Crazy Vacancies...
1	Vaccines are the light at the end of the tunnel. Let's all do our part and get vaccinated.
0	Sadly we all know the truth. And we all need to stick together in order to overcome the evils of this world. God and community and love for one another.
0	This is why vaccines take a long time to get approved and only those who were at a dire threat of dying should have been given the option to receive the experimental therapy.
0	The world is f****d ! It must of been all those Covid vaccines that‚Äôs made everyone so so stupid
1	For anyone wondering some infections cause heart inflammation (strep throat for example) and this is the biggest concern and why you should be treated.
0	The rage I feel inside when I think of the mistreatment of the unvaccinated burns my soul. I want retribution.
0	corona virus is the common cold. vaccine is bioweapon..
0	Two sorts of empirical data, drawn largely from UK and The Netherlands, are reviewed. These relate to the claims, actions and discourse of anti-vaccination groups on the one hand, and to the way parents of young children think about vaccines and vaccination on the other.
1	It isn't even about the vaccines. Traditional anti-vaxxer nuts jumped on the bandwagon, but knowingly or not they are all just in this because of MAGAts and Qs conspiracies about anything surrounding Trump and Biden.
1	Great episode as always. Don't agree with the vaccine stance that they were completely ineffective. First factor against this argument is that the hospital system was already overwhelmed. Could have been way worse. Secondly, the thing with vaccines is that herd immunity can't be effective if only old people or a select section of the population takes them. In a way it can be argued that the virus was forced to evolve into something less fatal because of the vaccine. Last point, we were in survival mode as a species for 1.5 years, so prioritizing survival over economy is still the right trade-off. Agreed that we've accumulated $4T economic cost, but we will pay it off.
0	This injection is not safe nor effective.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  It does not stop, or slow the transmission nor does it stop anyone from contracting the virus.
0	Justice  The covid vax is going to solve the #Democrat problem.  #vaccinated #unvaccinated #ClotShotStrikesAgain #CovidVaccine https://t.co/kWKalsrt7c
1	Happy to get my vaccines and boosters as long as I need to. It's an easy way to take care of myself and others
1	We need boosters because they work.
1	I'm sick of the rants about the COVID vaccine causing myocarditis. The COVID virus itself causes myocarditis 100 times more often than the vaccine itself. Literally! This means that if you are really afraid of myocarditis then you should DEFINITELY get vaccinated. Good Tuesday!
1	It‚Äôs possible to be pro vaccine and against mandates, two very different things.
1	opens door for vaccine mandates for ur kids and grandkids
0	Dr fauci lied and people died
1	When Antivaxers reject both fact and logic it's an uphill battle. I must say I've now given up, it's like trying to get a child to eat vegetables
0	Doesn't the immune system remain stronger than it was pre vaccine even after the antibodies are gone? So there is a benefit to being vaccinated even years after? It's just not as much of a benefit the more time that passes
1	Erikson‚Äôs husband is one of these goofball anti-Vaxxers. Not a political opportunist like her, an actual anti-vax, vaccines cause autism goofball.
1	I'm well over 65, have multiple health issues all under managemsnt, and REALLY don't want to get Covid. I wear a,mask where appropriate don't attend events with large crowds, and try to stay healthy. I‚ÄùvE had both vaccinations and both booster shots and have thus far managed to not get any form of the disease. I credit the vaccinations and booster shots, plus,my sensible behavior, for not getting the disease.
0	The way they were shoving it on us and also after my Moms good friend died from the 2nd booster
1	Vaccines are safe; they do not cause harm. The greater danger is the disease the vaccine prevents.
1	Got my second vaccine today and guys the side effects everyone is scared of are basically nothing. Got a mild headache and felt tired. You can't tell the difference between this and just a poor night of rest honestly.
1	Vaccines work, homeopathy doesn't you dangerous charlatan
1	You forget the very good vaccine ABDULA from Cuba. It is very efficiency. It helps Cuba win the war against Covid19. Cuba has now only some hundreds covid19 patient and some dead daily... Look at WORLDOMETER to see it and then compare to countries like USA, Russia, England, Germany, Ukraine, Poland,...
1	I don‚Äôt care if it eventually turns me into a zombie as long as I can have a pint in the pub this summer üëçüèª
0	I challenge any #provaxxer to tell me the exact ingredients of the 'vaccine' & if you can, what they do... Further the long term effects. Thank you but I'm not getting the shot.
1	Just got my second shot yesterday.
1	After 2 boosters, I'm absolutely thrilled that vaccines prevailed.
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like ‚Äúno more vaccines‚Äù. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years‚Ä¶
1	Thank you for trying to take care of our state and doing the best you can with the information we have! My county is full of non mask wearers and leaders that have said they will not enforce mandates - we are in the purple tier and our hospitals are overwhelmed- go figure.
0	During a vaccination session: Patient: Does it guarantee immunity ? Doctor: Only for the manufacturers.
0	Covid vaccine will cause death. Had many in USA suffering from complications and death.
0	There are no benefits just more money for big pharma
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	Common sense meets Science. Brilliantly explained thank you, @Vox!
1	Don‚Äôt be mean to anti-vaxxers they are just trying to do what they think is right (although they are completely wrong.
1	I'm 66 years in USA, I was required by law, as a child to have every vaccination of value for young children. Then I was vaccinated the hell out of when I joined the US Navy in boot camp. I've had tetanus shots, pneumonia shots, shingles, flu shots the last 10 years. I'm as perfectly healthy and more so than others my age or even younger. So,,, F you, you anti-vaccination aholes! Stop being dicks!
0	I think the vaccine was made to make people sick in the future so they can sell more medicine for example heart problems, a sustainable business model.
0	We don't believe you paid off actors anymore. We are seeing the effects of the poison you've coerced people to take all over live television. News broadcasters, sports stars, etc, all succumbing to vaccine injuries right in front of our eyes. Numerous¬†good doctors who actually care about people are working to develop ways to treat the people you have hurt. And you just make yourself look even stupider everytime you do this sh*t.
0	Glad I never got jabbed and don't plan on ever getting any Covid jabs. Haven't been sick since early 2020. Probably my natural immunity did the trick.
0	I didn't because I was afraid of what my immune system would do.
1	While I wasn't doubting the vaccine, this cleared up my confusion on the differences between the vaccines. I really appreciate this video. We're almost there!
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
1	Got first shot of Pfizer on Friday,a bit of headache and muscle discomfort in my arm.That's it.
1	Vaccins aren't meant to slow spread, but mostly to reduce illnesses. Meaning that your friends could in fact be right about your spouse getting severely more ill if he hadn't been vaccinated.  If everyone else is saying you're in the wrong, you should entertain the thought, that just maybe, you are in the wrong and you are the one who has been brainwashed. It's easy to end up on a filterbubble
0	they are NOT Vaccines.
0	What they have done to people with these vaccines is so infuriating. Peoples loved ones and friends have been harmed by this. Preyed on peoples fear, so they could injure and even kill them. There needs to be justice. These are crimes against humanity
0	In the hospital is totaly empty, guess we dont need the vaccine.
0	Have you seen those videos on CNN of ppl who had AE after the vax but told everyone to get vaxxed cuz the benefits outweighs the risks?or that British actress who suffered Bell's palsy & made a video telling  the world that the vaccine is safe & that she would do it again
0	My best friend got her 3 shot about two months ago, and she is forgetting everything, it is so hard to watch, it's like she is disappearing from herself She didn't want to get it, but her parents forced her!
0	CDC credibility score: 0. Defund today.
1	The same people complaining about vaccines and their freedoms are the same people that would have protested against people with AIDS attending public school because they think they would have caused some sort of plague
0	What does me getting the vaccine do for you, other than make you feel good about your bad choice?
0	These vaccines are so new and millions of people ran out and accepted them, may god be with us all

0	did you hear about the baby that was born with a blood clot in his arm and needed amputation and had a stroke? ill pass on your poison jab.
1	... but so can Covid. Are you even aware that most vaccines today have side effects that could be deadly to some people? Even most medications prescribed by doctors can have deadly side effects. You have to consider the risks versus the benefits.
0	sick is the only way to describe Dr's like this.
1	#covid19vaccine will become an annual bivalent vaccine with the same vaccine being used in unvaccinated patients #covid19 @prescriberight #pharmacists #physicians #nurses
1	At the end, this is a bunch of doctors saying what they personally believe. I prefer facts, studies - check PubMed, there the message is clear: vaccines work.
0	Pfizer can politely fuck off.
1	Vaccination is the most efficient strategy for preventing infectious disease.
0	Why TF is government or any corporation mandating vaccines - AZ, #moderna, #pfizer. And you want our kids vaccinate‚Ä¶ https://t.co/mivbbXY5CZ
0	I have been unvaccinated four times now and I'll  be unvaccinated a fifth time next week.
0	So now "unvaccinated folks" are not "regular folks"? I never wanted to be "regular" anyway.
0	My fiance and I had covid early December. He had terrible chills, headache, muscle aches. It affected me like a mild flu. Apparently I had it last May as well and the urgent care didn't call with my results so I checked my one chart and I was positive.  Thought it was just a cold. Both unvaccinated, kind of overweight in that "high risk" category. Healthy people in shape younger than us developed "pre existing heart conditions" after getting vaccinated. Don't be test subjects over a virus with a high survivability rate.
1	I had the vaccine and I am pro vaccine but I‚Äôm against forced vaccination. I believe everyone has the fundamental right to decide what goes into their body.
1	My 77 year old Aunt Grace and I got our latest Covid vaccine booster shot yesterday, yay!!!
0	The case of three companies saying they used a pig byproduct to make the vaccine, and then saying that none of the vaccines use animal products? Great explanation. I don't trust your companies and your vaccines
1	The jab? Is that the antivax cults way of saying COVID vaccination?  I have been 5x Moderna vaccinated and I am fine. Ask your doctor for medical advice, not conspiracy accounts
0	You forgot the con being it kills you, or makes you wish you were dead.
0	I agree with Joe. Got vaccinated from peer pressure. Ruined my life. Have had a ringing in my ears that will not go away that started 10 days after shot. If you‚Äôre healthy like I was I would say skip it. I‚Äôm miserable now. Would have never gotten the shot of it wasn‚Äôt for family and media pressure.
0	The COVID vaccines don't work and vaccine injuries are common. Stop pushing this poison!
0	I'm so happy I live in Florida and was able to dodge the jab. Even before the controversy, I never would've gotten it.
0	And that is why people have been calling it a clot shot for years now, yet no one would listen.
1	My partner and I have had all our Covid inoculations and we're still here.
0	The covid vaccines are a BIO WEAPON!
0	To everyone who got the "vaccscheme." To everyone who berated those of us that refused. To everyone who blindly went along with the narrative without question. To the employers who mandated taking an experimental "vaccine." To everyone who is now regretting that decision because of sickness and medical complications. WE TOLD YOU SO
1	Vaccinations are one of the easiest and cost effective ways to protect children's health and future. #ProVaccination #Health #Healthcare #Children #MinistryofHealth
1	Just give Vaccines to anyone who will take them ‚Ä¶.available to everyone all of the time‚Ä¶.end the nonsense
0	There can be problems if you have autoimmune issues. I have rheumatoid disease and saw in my groups people were posting they were having issues post jab. I assumed it was just anti vax posters until a close friend, who shares my disease, developed blepharospasm which left her functionally blind.. hopefully temporarily. She was pro vax before this happened. The big problem is that since it isn't fda approved she isn't offered the same protections as it doesn't use the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and the system they are using in it's place isn't very helpful. It is extremely frustrating. It's easy to say it is safe because the majority of people are fine, but it does adversely effect some people.
0	So tell me what you think the vaccine is good for!  Certainly not preventing COVID.
0	They lied about social distancing. The virus spreads through aerosols in the air. It doesn't matter where you stand. Stickers on the floor don't protect you. They just break social cohesion.
0	My friend and her mom got vaccinated. Her mom ended up in the covid ward and died alone. My friend's heart is broken. She says she did everything "they" told her to do, but when the time came, she, her sisters, and her dad were not allowed to be with her mom during the last days of her life. My friend carries enormous guilt that her mom died alone and now she wants to know what for.
0	The fact you think vaccines and masks will fix the problem is hilarious.
1	I get vaccinated to give myself a fighting chance at avoiding a disease. I don‚Äôt know why YOU should get vaccinated, though.
1	Healthcare workers are heroes in every sense of the word, and they deserve all the support we can give them. They've been working around the clock for months now, and it's time for us to do our part and help them out. By getting vaccinated, we're not only protecting ourselves, but we're also slowing down the spread of the virus, which will make it easier for healthcare workers to do their jobs. Let's show them that we care by taking the vaccine and doing our part in this fight against the pandemic.
1	To these people I say... My mom died because of covid. Do you think I wouldn't have wished we had the vaccine at the time? I would've taken whatever IMAGINARY illnesses/killswitches they offered if it meant I she would still be here.
0	NO SHOTS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE !.... O'my Jesus forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of hell, lead all souls to heaven especially those who have most need of thy mercy. Amen.
0	I now have blood cancer. Thanks Pfizer
1	I got the covid shot as soon as I could. All of my family got it too. We know how important it is to get it. We all are doing great. So I encourage anyone out there t GET THE VACCINE.
1	How many of those are unvaccinated? If you haven't gotten the shot and die from it...kinda on you.
1	So what is it? A weak vaccine that DOES NOTHING hence the boosters? Or is it such a POWERFUL vaccination that it can kill you YEARS later?
1	The world is not big anymore; it is a small village. Please get vaccinated if you haven't yet.
1	Vassine are gift from our Goat Lord Bee Gates and the holy son Lord Frauci .. praise to our Goat
1	vaccines rarely had a fatal result
1	It‚Äôs not unnecessary, not dangerous. There is no logical reason you shouldn‚Äôt get the jab. Thousands of doctors have agreed that it is saf
1	The anti-vaxxers are the same people who create dozens of other ridiculous conspiracies
1	Every time someone says they have microchips but they have a phone in their hand I said ‚ÄúThe fbi taps your phone all the time but you‚Äôre scared of a needle.‚Äù
0	Proudly Un-jabbed!!
0	I think most have come to the realization that the vaccines don't work and there are better ways of managing symptoms. If you hold out the trend will shift away from bad medicine.
0	This fucking world, you guys got to hide your vaccination shot
1	it's an honour getting the vaccine for free
1	I am very happy to be alive. I would get the shot again, if need be!
0	If you're intelligent and have a sound mind, you won't get immunized. Have fun and take it if you want to play russian roulette.
1	Very exciting news, just worried now how many people will take it. Antivaxxers are gearing up for their misinformation campaign
0	Listening to them trying to cover for the clear issues related to this experimental jab, is like watching a computer breaking down and can't compute
0	Scrap the whole vaccination for everyone and we will all live in a better place‚Ä¶.
0	This video leaves out WAY WAY more than it tells! What about the SM-102? The polysorbate 80? The polyethylene glycol? The fetal tissue? We want to know more about THOSE things!
1	No it doesn't. All of the US vaccines are extremely effective against all of the variants. #Scariants
1	Get vaccinated kid. Already got mine, no mark of the beasting here
0	From day I knew better than to get that experimental vaccine!
1	Akways love listening but have to say the COVID section failed on some basic facts. The biggest piece of missing context is that the vaccines unequivocally worked and still work to reduce the risk of serious illness and death. Their rapid implementation saved a huge number of lives, ended the overloaded hospitals. etc. Multiple papers support the idea that even if the protection against transmission fades pretty quickly, the immune memory that prevents serious illness is more durable. It's hard to judge the marginal value of a 3rd., 4th or Xth shot in this regard, but there's no question you're safer having the initial vaccinations (at least as an adult). Also, if we're talking about myocarditis, it's important to note that the risk of myocarditis from actually having COVID is a good ways higher than from getting the shot. (one example, study of 43 million people: https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.059970) ) Not that this should shut down debate, it gets complicated - does that benefit still hold when infection is near-universal anyway? what if those illnesses are milder due to the vax? etc. -- but you can't just say, "the vaccination raises risk of myocarditis, ergo it's dangerous" Even allowing that this myocarditis is almost always mild. Anyway, your push for transparency and ongoing questioning of the science is a good thing but the audience lost out in the spin here.
1	If the vaccine was a ruse, then why did it work? Go outside, it's visible with your own eyes that significantly less have died or even have COVID. These takes posted here are refutable just by going out in society.
0	No, I have already been infected with covid 19 and another vaccination would not do anything. But I have already been vaccinated against shingles and more people need to be at least 50 years old or older.
0	Got one dose of moderna but skipped the second. Not worth it!
1	Since these anti vaxxers don‚Äôt believe in science and medicine, I suppose they won‚Äôt take their children to doctors or hospitals if they do get sick or get measles or other preventable diseases. They are endangering the health of those who believe in vaccines, since they demand the right to interact with society without talking responsibility for protecting the society.
1	Thank you, to these people who are @ the front of the line for us, but please get vaccinated, it is so important. keep safe everyone
1	Not getting vaccinated endangers others through herd immunity
0	This vaccine is neither safe nor effective. Obviously.
0	Is death listed as a side effect? That seems to be happening a bit.
1	Thank you! you‚Äôve convinced me to get the shot. Getting it tomorrow
0	More than 59 million people were contacted by anti-vaccination campaigners using social media to disseminate rumors and theories concerning the safety of COVID-19 vaccinations.
0	üö´Absolutely NO mandatory vaccines.  Resist this intrusion.  #Trump2020 üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/CVvsxAqdyx
1	Always get the flu shot and I will getting the booster, too. Thank science we have these very important and lifesaving tools at our disposal
1	Why don‚Äôt the Nets just suspend or just cut his selfish ass?  It‚Äôs a shot, it protects not just you, but the people around you.
0	I believe that COVID-19 is a hoax, and I'm not going to waste my time getting vaccinated for something that doesn't even exist.
0	I'm 43 years old and remember D.A.R.E from school.  I haven't thought about it since this clown show started.  I smelled a rat from day number one too.    Thank you D.A.R.E ?.... and Alex Jones.  He was right you know.
0	Saying the vaccine is safe is NOT true though..
0	Did you get lucky with the vax? Even if you did, you should detox immediately. The long-term effects of this vaccine are deadly.
0	Unvaccinated will be fine. Scientifically it is not fully tested
1	Who wants to put their life in the hands of pilots who won't even take a jab in the arm to help their community?
1	I ain't gonna fall for the anti-vaxxer BS, vaccines save lives
0	Don't want no microchip.
0	vaccines were developed too quickly and that we don't know the long-term effects yet.
1	by taking vaccine how I am protecting my loved ones and society
1	Get vaccinated dimwit
0	‚ÄúCovid‚Äù is the seasonal flu which apparently nobody has had for the past three years. Now I‚Äôm seeing ads for the flu vaccine again.
1	as someone who got the full vaccine and booster, it‚Äôs a little off-putting (cold-like symptoms) for about 3 days to a week after getting the shots but after that it‚Äôs completely fine. also, i wear my mask whenever i go out and i haven‚Äôt gotten covid once
1	Got a sore arm the next day from the Pfizer vaccine. It's pretty painful and means I can barely use my arm for anything that day. Whereas the Moderna vaccine made me sick the next day. Nothing major. Just a mild fever and feeling crappy for about 8 hours. But that's it.   Gotten 4 of the shots so far and getting the fifth for the Omicron variant next month.
0	Vaccine insiders are in here pretty strong
0	This is clearly the most failing medical product in the history of medical products both in terms of efficacy and safety
1	This is why I resent those who refuse to get vaccinations And refuse to wear masks. They don't care if they hurt me.
1	Getting vaccinated is a way to protect our healthcare system and frontline workers.
1	vaccines are good, masks are good. Stoping the  spread would be great
0	I think the government will track our movements with this vaccine passport.
0	We need to know what the components are that make up this particular vaccine given the stigma and hesitation from so many citizens of the World. No way i'll be taking it
0	The vaccine‚Äôs wonderful even though it May or may not have led to my father-in-law death.  I‚Äôm sure there are numerous reasons as to why my father-in-law suffered the same symptoms after each dose.  I‚Äôm sure it was a coincidence those symptoms became more intense after the second shot.  I‚Äôm confident this reporter is not trying to manipulative this young lady.  Who knows sudden paralysis and heart disease may be quite normal for young people.
1	It‚Äôs not a cure, it‚Äôs vaccine..
1	This whole anti-vaxxers thing was spawned by a study that was completely wrong
1	Only one day in as President-Elect and @JoeBiden has developed a vaccine for Covid19. Amazing!!
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
0	My mothers best friend started having heart complications after the shot. I pray she gets better everyday.
1	The COVID vaccine is the safest and most effective way to protect ourselves and our communities. Let's do our part. #VaccinateNow
0	Forcing people to take the poison should be treated as a criminal act. All who pushed for the poison to be distributed should be imprisoned!
1	I think this is a good sign: it means people either already caught covid so they already know what to do; or they don't have serious enough symptoms to be worried; or they are already aware by some other way of what to do
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab‚Ä¶NOT ONE.
1	Please wear your masks, sanitise, social distance, isolate & lockdown...oh & get 'vaccinated'
1	Same here. My anxiety is worse than it has ever been. Especially because I work in a busy bar and can‚Äôt avoid the general public. I also have unvaccinated coworkers who won‚Äôt wear masks, even though they are supposed to here in California. I am beyond frustrated.
0	Government reports prove COVID Vaccination is killing Hundreds of Thousands every week & Confidential Pfizer Docs. confirm your Government knew it would happen
0	I agree the virus doesn't and doesn't want to kill you. However, the remedy does.
0	How much theoretical sense it makes to view anti-vaccination groups as (new) social movement organizations (as distinct from pressure groups or self-help organizations) is as yet unclear.
1	I got Pfizer first dose. When the first day after getting my vaccine. My left arm(injection site) Is unbearably painful. My muscle was so painful. The next day thank god no more muscle pain but im tired like really tired. Lucky no fever.. guess my immune kinda op?
0	MRNA Vaccine is a "Shotgun Blast" to Brain and Reproductive Organs
1	Happy to say I‚Äôm well on the mend from my breakthrough Covid infection! I definitely credit the bivalent vaccine for my fairly mild case.
1	I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt trust the doctor when they tell people to get vaccinated, but they trust the exact same doctor to treat them for the illness they could have been vaccinated against.
0	The most vaccinated nations have the most infections.
0	You don‚Äôt actually ser her being vaccinated, her sleeve covers that part
1	I like the vaccine. I‚Äôve never gotten Covid personally and the death rates from covid are drastically down because of the vaccines
1	None of my family members have perished from the vaccination, and were all got the initial vaccine two years ago plus we also all got the needed boosters.
1	I trust the science behind the Covid vaccine.
0	IT‚ÄôS NOT SAFE. THEY WABT US DEAD!! WAKE UP YOU BLOODY FOOLS!!
0	The point is if she did not take the VAX she would still be with us . R.I.P....
1	‚Ç¨15.9 billion raised for universal access to tests, treatments and vaccines against coronavirus and for the global recovery.
1	please leave them mRNA vaccines alone. We can‚Äôt reach herd immunity if your natural immunity is weakened by these shots
0	As someone who had very serious side effects from the jab, if I could go back, I would not take it again.
1	anti vaxxers are dangerous uneducated zealots who believe things they see on youtube
0	Happy father's day to my dad. We miss you every day and still can't understand why you're gone. #FucModerna
1	Such a damn shame that we can't give the vaccines to people that want and need it in different countries. This is infuriating.
0	Is it approved by WHO ??? If not approved vaccine so why you r suggest.??
1	Yeah. Celebrity X could die in a plane crash. "It was the vaccines!!!!!"
0	Those "theories" actually came from some of the scientists who have worked inside big pharma or even helped develop the toxic injections. Since they have blown the whistle, they appear to have been very right about their predictions.
1	The vaccine provides us with hope for the future.
0	‚ÄúAnd there is some protection against infection‚Äù
0	Imagine being #vaccinated and having to worry every single night that you might not wake up the next day.  Doesn‚Äôt matter whether youre a child or an adult.  I feel sorry for the vaccinated.  Has to be absolutely terrifying.  #Covid #Jabbed #Covid19 #Plandemic #WHO #CDC
1	Skeptical about the COVID-19 vaccine? Do your research and talk to trusted health professionals. The benefits of getting vaccinated far outweigh any potential side effects.
1	I got 2 vaccine..bcoz December 7th I feel positive so coronteen finished 27 December..can I get 3rd vaccine?
0	Im not getting that death shot
0	Thank God I never took this poison.
0	New studies out , it‚Äôs poison do not take this experimental so called vaccine
1	Vax have been around for centuries and have been instrumental in eradicating diseases that once killed millions.
1	Thank you for accepting me to your group. I joined to be able to get away from the insanity of recent posts about what the vaccine is going to do to me.  I have been asked if I am magnetized, if I have had a stroke, and lastly I saw a picture of someone in a casket with a caption - The look you have when you are up to date on your vaccines‚Äô I hope I can get reliable information here. You sure can‚Äôt get it much anywhere else these days.
0	These are the #Clots that the #vaccines are producing. This was first brought up by #DrJaneRuby and embalmer #RichardHirschman   Richard is having to removed these from the arteries of #vaccinated corpses just to put embalming fluid into them. #DiedSuddendly #CovidVaccines https://t.co/voRMpl6VcE
0	Heard  of  just now on  I dont think I can allow my parents or my family to take vac
0	We scanned about a dozen vaxxed with a geiger counter, the vaxxed are leaching radiation
0	Why should I get the Covid Vaccine? So that the Government can inject a Microchip? Absolutely not!
0	Dont get the flu shot. That is a hoax too. Did you know a know poison is in them----same material used to make paint thinner. Simply look up the ingredients on the cdc website and google each ingredient.
1	Well considering I went for my first jab of the AstraZeneca vaccine yesterday, I‚Äôd say yes.  Even with the side effects I got, the positives far outweigh the negatives
1	In 2020, vaccines prevent more than 1.2m deaths globally. An additional 2 million child deaths could be prevented each year through immunization with currently available vaccines.  Stay away from #misinformation and #GetVaccinated #StaySafe
0	I am not vaccinated at all and have had no side effects and I never have to worry about heart attacks. So I got that going for me. Which is nice.
1	I trust science, and the COVID-19 vaccine is a testament to how far we've come in fighting this virus
1	I got the vaccine because I don't want to get covid and I'm doing everything I can not to catch it. I get people saying we don't know the long term effects of the vaccine, but do we know the long term effects of covid? No, we don't know that either... but we do know it kills people, we know some people have long covid and feel sick for months, we know it can make a lot of damage to the body, we know all that already. So, I prefer taking my chances with the vaccine instead of the disease, or if I get covid being vaccinated, everything points to it won't be as hard. My mom was hesitant to get it and I said to her "if you get covid you'll regret not getting the vaccine when you could".
0	Jesus is all I need to stay healthy
1	vaccinated a few days ago
1	I was tempted to thinking that the fall in cases also had to do with the lower temperatures around the US, but it has all to do with the many Americans that decided to take this virus seriously. The adults that actually act like they are adults have to take care of the ones that choose to act like rebellious children.
1	12."I'm not going to get the COVID vaccine because I don't think it will do any good. I think it's just a waste of time and money."
0	21 reasons why I won't get vaccinated (written summer 2021): 1. Already developed natural immunity. 2. Never solved lipid nanoparticle delivery. 3. Japanese Pfizer data shows LNP in organs. 4. Vax makers are immune from liability. 5. Every previous mRNA vax failed.
0	no scientific data on the safety and efficacy of the Pfizer`s bivalent vaccine
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a game-changer! I'm so grateful for the scientists and healthcare workers who made it possible.
0	After the first dose of the Russian Sputnik vaccine, I had a lot of pain in my heart and chest, and a strange noise keeps coming from my heart. Does anyone know the reason? Death to all enforcers of compulsory vaccination
0	taking the vaccine was the worst desicion of my life.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
0	The Pfizer shot is listed with 1291 side effects. That's insane!
0	Take as much vax you want )ick head
1	Our First Lady & Second Gentleman enjoyed themselves at a ball game,  having beer and enjoying being out in the public! The life of being vaccinated is good!!
0	I‚Äôm a young 27 year old male healthy as can be until i got the Moderna shots‚Ä¶. I now have brain fog and alot of chest pain especially near my heart.. I truly believe the vaccine has caused this. God bless us all!
0	I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries.
0	fully.vaccinated people are dying from the virus. People that I know.
0	No Vaccine for me, Husband or Kiddos!! #NoClotShot wish u could say the same for A A lot of my family.
0	i'm thankful and proud to be unvaxxed from covid and flu shots since 2010. and no one will tell me that I need a vaccine.
1	Definitely. I don't want to worry about getting it. I want to help eradicate the coronavirus so that no more deaths from it happen. Families, friends, people can be together. Small businesses can open up again and employees can hopefully employees can return to work.
0	These dudes are way to enthusiastic about getting injected!!!
0	My coworker passed away one week after the jab. Just a coincidence I'm sure.
0	Look up the horrific side effects and then tell your kids not to sleep around.
1	"I don't like the idea of getting a COVID vaccine because it means I'll have to admit that the pandemic is real and it's affecting us all."
0	My son got covid vaccine a year or so ago. A few months ago he started having sudden heart race even when he sits.
0	Can we name the next variant the ‚Äúgay‚Äù variant? Maybe conservatives will clamor to get the vaccine if they don‚Äôt want to catch the gay
0	I was just told that if I don‚Äôt get the vaccine I won‚Äôt be able to work at the place I‚Äôm currently working at what do y‚Äôall think I should do? Cause I‚Äôm kinda scared of getting it like idkkkk
1	I feel a sense of relief knowing that I've taken a step to protect myself and those I love.
0	Getting vaccinated is a responsible choice. We need to do our part to control the spread of the virus.
1	Getting vaccinated reduces your odds of becoming infected with COVID, although it does not eliminate the risk
0	I think vaccines can cause a decline in brain activity. I experienced it first-hand
1	they developed a covid vaccine and did a pretty good job. i got it and it possibly saved my life last year.
0	Let's make it a circus!
1	This is what happens when you have a society that no longer teaches civics in classes, they grow up to be be grown children with no understanding of consequences of their actions, and how it affects those around them.
0	This vaccine ruined my life. I'm suffering every day.
0	The COVID vaccine is untested and unproven!! Dont trust it
0	The last thing the vaccinated can hang their hat on is that the vaccine prevents more serious illness. Seems like all other benefits of the vaccine have turned out to not be so true. Will this one go away soon too?
1	You're young and the virus would likely not do much to you, but you can spread the virus to much more vulnerable people.
1	I know an anti-vax woman, mother of 5 (Edit: 4) (Edit: 3)
0	noticed you mentioned the MRNA vaccines but what about the j&j vaccine? That‚Äôs the one I got but I never hear much about it. And lately I‚Äôve been super concerned about long term effects. Ô∏è
1	Bet you can‚Äôt name a single person in the USA that died from a Covid shot.
1	Thrilled to receive my first dose of the Covid vaccine today. The vulnerable people I visit, support and work with‚Ä¶ https://t.co/V5Y2JUMIi9
1	I hope everyone is having a good day except people who dont vaccinate their kids.
0	The authors concluded that ‚Äúalthough smaller in overall size, anti-vaccination clusters manage to become highly entangled with undecided clusters in the main online network, whereas pro-vaccination clusters are more peripheral‚Äù.
0	It has such a poor effectiveness, sometimes as low as 10%. Why bother?
0	With what we know today, I would never get the vaccine. That is my personal choice. I‚Äôve seen too many healthy, young people that I personally know deal with clotting issues after being fully vaccinated.
0	WHO is liable for future vaccination damage, when the data situation with the corresponding side effects can no longer be dismissed
1	Sometimes I wonder how the human race has survived this long. Ignorance is the mother of all dangers
1	I‚Äôve had 4 now, still alive, no side effects. So did everyone in my family Had covid once and it wasn‚Äôt bad, only felt under weather for 3 days. No regrets. I don‚Äôt take medical advice from flat earthers
1	Great video explaining some misconceptions people have, and you even mentioned T cells, fantastic stuff! Antibodies usually get all the glory mainly just because they‚Äôre easier to work with in the lab.
0	No vaccine never
0	#DiedSuddendly why would anyone doubt that the party who voted to kill babies in the womb, right up until birth & beyond, laying on a metal table, screaming in pain, would give a shit how many might die of an EUA vaccine? it was a calculated risk they were willing to take.
0	I am now fully convinced the covid "vaccine" is being used for depopulation.
0	Also, 45?! Did the vax age you like spoiled milk too? Phew! Sue them, girl!
0	Unmasked Unvaccinated Unafraid
1	High! I got mine yesterday too!
1	Thank you for explaining this so perfectly.  I'm exhausted trying to fight the non believers.
1	My husband & I are fully vaccinated & boosted. After attending a small family holiday party, we both tested positive for Covid. I am 65 & my husband is 74, both with underlying conditions. We had flu like symptoms. Without the vaccines, I know we would have been much worse.
0	This video has helped me a lot. I‚Äôm definitely not putting something in my body that will affect my natural immunity. How can anything compare to what the Most High has put inside you naturally
1	This video gave me chills.  It also confirms my belief that many covid anti vaxxers would rather die than get vaxxed.
1	I was lucky enough to receive the COVID-19 vaccine before it became widely available, and I can say that the experience was painless and over quickly.
1	Had the first dose of my COVID vaccine today. We still have to wear PPE and still socially distant but at least we‚Ä¶ https://t.co/SEQtUiZGwf
1	We all (hopefully) understand that the COVID-19 vaccines reduce risk of illness and death due to COVID-19. The problem is that videos like this don't bother to recognize the fact that risk management is not about reducing risk to zero - rather, it's about reducing risk to an acceptable level. You can always sacrifice more and more to reduce risk, but the question is how much? How much should be sacrificed, and what is an acceptable level of risk?  If we refer to a similar situation, such as the seasonal flu, we know that we don't freak out about getting the flu vaccine, so that means we find the risk level for the seasonal flu to be acceptable. What's the mortality rate of the flu? It's 0.0018% (from CDC's National Vital Statistics System), or 0.0152% if you include pneumonia, which is often caused by the flu. The COVID-19 vaccines are so good that even an overestimate of the mortality rate for COVID-19 among people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 is 0.00162% (from the CDC's report on the first month of COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring). That's a lower mortality rate than the flu's. This means that someone who is vaccinated against COVID-19 is at an acceptable level of risk.  Under the PREP Act, anyone involved in manufacturing, distributing, or administering the the COVID-19 vaccine (because the PREP Act covers EUA vaccines) is immune from any legal liability for adverse effects. That means that if the vaccine kills you or if someone botches your shot, courts will dismiss any lawsuits against the company who made the vaccine or gave you your shot. The chances of such things happening are very low, but that's not what matters to many people. What matters is the violation of the principle that if you buy a product or take a drug, the manufacturer should be liable if their product does something bad. The PREP Act poses a moral issue to people. Even the Nuremberg Code protects people from involuntarily being tested on with experimental drugs.  If someone finds it worthwhile to sacrifice their rights to get the COVID-19 vaccine, then they are free to do so. However, videos like this do nothing to convince us why it's worthwhile for the rest of us to get the vaccine. As I stated before, people who are vaccinated can enjoy an acceptably low risk. Those who opt not to get vaccinated are doing so of their own free will. I am one of those people, and I feel like I've thought about this issue very thoroughly. I invite the insight of others, but I haven't yet met anyone who has been able to refute my above reasoning.
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
1	Talk to Doctors who uphold their oath to do no harm first and do your own research.
1	I got my 2 COVID Shots the COVID booster and also the Moderna recent COVID shot, plus my flu shot. No problems!! Never got COVID!! No side affects on any of them  Yes!!!
0	The coronavirus panic is dumb
0	It's not covid....it's the untested "vaccines" doing the damage.
1	Personally, I would prefer my family to take Sinovac COVID-19 Vaccines
0	This is why many of us wanted long term safety studies before being forced to get the vax.
0	Lol okay so where is all the people I was arguing with and saying that you shouldn't take the vaccine...you guys had alot to say thenüëÄ
1	The vaccine is safe and effective. Let's do our part and get vaccinated as soon as we're eligible.
1	Get vaccinated and do your part to protect public health.
1	I'm a paramedic at a hospital and our dept vax rate is 60%. Which means 40% of the paramedics I work with, who take care of covid patients literally every day, refuse to get it.  I don't understand at all.
1	Imagine the fury from all the scientists working on this with all their knowledge on how it works and all the effort they put into this when they get told by someone that they won't get it because of what someone said on facebook.
1	Get vaccinated. Tetanus Toxoid, Hepatitis B virus vaccine and others should be started and  completed.
0	As COVID-19 vaccines moved through development, the public-health communities anticipated considerable vaccine hesitancy.
0	#vaxxinjuries #vaccineinjuries #VaccineDeaths Its has always been a planned depopulation bioweapon
1	Personally I'm a pro for vaccines and thought this would just be another angry conversation but this is actually nice to see and to hear how much I agree with both sides as well as disagree with some other things
0	Covid is too mild a disease to justify vaccination, so is measles
1	I did not risk my life. I wasn't part of a great conspiracy. I am a adult making a rational decision about my health care.
0	Everyone has their own immune system in their body and that's what GOD gave it to us for ,
0	Never in my life. I'd rather die than trust Pfizer or Moderna to put a safe product on the market over profits.
0	I just feel more confident when I can order one from my doctor vs getting it in a Wendy‚Äôs parking lot. That‚Äôs literally it. I just want to be taken more seriously considering we know nothing about this vaccine in the long run.
0	After they injected the vaccine they say, "we need to better understand what that risk is "... Nice approach.Shouldn't it be in the opposite order?
0	Been anti vaccine for many years. Want to continue to learn with out the constant harassment from the bullies.
0	It gives people myocarditis. Sometimes seizures. We've seen it a bunch of times.
1	Vaccine saved me from covid
1	I've seen the devastating impact of covid on people's health, and it's just too risky not to take the vaccine. I trust science, and I know that the vaccine has been extensively tested and proven to be safe and effective.
1	Side effects are a common occurrence with any vaccine and do not necessarily mean it is unsafe or ineffective
1	They literally get vaccinated with everything and anything BUT the covid vaccine is unwarranted? COME ON
0	Imagine a vaccine so safe you have to be blackmailed into taking it for a virus so deadly you have to be tested to even know you have it.
0	Guys this isn‚Äôt bad at all it‚Äôs just a little cough and fever the government just wants us to hide in our houses to prove that they control us. They don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs good for us. You can leave your hous
1	For herd immunity, I will get the vaccine
0	Covid Vaccine is Dangerous, Others are Safe
0	save the children from the vaccine!
1	Vaccination is a proactive step towards a healthier future for all.
1	Here's something with a lot of logic, reason, and science in it. That means that some of our people think it is all garbage. That tells more about them than it does about persons of reason. Some of the anti maskers get all bent out of shape and say people treat them as if they are stupid because the persons of reason don't give any credence to their bonkers ideas. Well, if one doesn't want to be called stupid, then stop acting stupid.
1	Getting Covid vaccines over school breaks is starting to become a tradition #numberfive #covidvaccineadvocate #·¥†accinesaveslives
1	You will almost certainly have no side effects at all except maybe some soreness, and then you will almost guarantee that getting covid won't put you in a hospital
1	I mean‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm about as enthusiastic about getting boosters as I am about eating my veggies. It‚Äôs maintenance at this point and I‚Äôll get a yearly boost just like my flu shot.
0	I started watching the stock ticker symbol MRNA. In late 2019 it was about $12 bucks a share. By September 2021 it was approximately $420 a share. With some US citizens being legally aloud to do insider trading.. can you imagine how much money they made on this one stock?? I‚Äôd love to see which politicians bought this stock, when and how many shares they bought. I‚Äôm betting it would made us all sick to pure stomach.. they each have a new mansion and super car.
1	well, my 102 year old Omi(grandma), has all the shots and she's doing great..
1	Why are skilled nursing centers with patients over 80 yo not in the first tier. Vaccinate those that may die first.
0	S-A-D-S , Exists, Thanks To The B-S-19 Jab.
0	Liability protections for COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers are real; but they are not evidence that the vaccines are unsafe.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	‚ÄúIn the first 3 weeks of 2023, #Africa has recorded around 21,000 #COVID19 cases. This is a 97% decline compared with the same period last year even if we are seeing increases in #SouthAfrica, #Tunisia & #Zambia‚Äù
1	True, a virus with a 99.7% survival rate should be feared to the point that experimental vaccines should given to all the healthy citizens.
0	I believe that the vaccine is the reason that I lost my mother since the hospital had no answers. I hope that all of the men and women that serve our country stand firm in refusing the vaccine. We need to change out our government.
0	NEVER putting that poison in my body! WHOever tries to give me or a loved one a shot gets one first!
1	They're worried about a side effect which is rare enough that they didn't even see it in the trial. Not the original study or after they doubled the participants. Would they see it in a bigger trial? Maybe, but that just goes to show how rare a side effect it is. Covid isn't nearly as dangerous in this age range as it is for older people but the vaccine is safer than that. If you aren't worried about Covid at this level then you really shouldn't be worried about the vaccine. And for older people the vaccine is orders of magnitude safer than the risk of Covid.
1	I volunteer myself to be publicly vaccinated. Is this a thing for non-famous ppl? I‚Äôll do it on TV or whatever. I want to return to normal life as soon as possible.
1	The selfish reason is that I‚Äôm tired. I suspect that I‚Äôve been stricter than most about my adherence to physical distancing guidelines, and I‚Äôd love to be able to relax and head to a restaurant again.
0	I'm not taking any chances with my child's health, we're going vaccine-free.
1	thank you for giving the importance of the vaccine
1	so happy that I am vaccinated so nothing is going to happen to me
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
1	WTF, and we have a bunch of idiots who dont vaccinate their kids and are just getting away bcos of herd immunity
1	I love seeing dumb people freaking out about these vaccines while me and my family here chilling safely after being vaccinated and we're all still healthy to this day
1	Good thing you got the vaccine. It sounds like COVID would have been fatal for you without it.
1	Many think the vaccine has contributed to unexplained deaths - that is not true.
0	Never let a good scam go to waste.
1	Hopefully soon you all will be able to receive your #COVID19Vaccine . I got both mine jabs and am so glad.
0	Notice the People saying we are in a Cult support a Vaccine that doesn‚Äôt work ? And continue to support it?   Ummmmm‚Ä¶.. ok
1	Yep. Well over 90% of hospital patients and deaths from COVID in this latest wave have been unvaccinated people.  Which is why I am a bit ticked that headlines read so and so tested positive while vaccinated. That's great, but are they actually symptomatic and suffering from the disease? No? Then why is this news?  Public health experts, to date, have repeatedly stated the breakthrough cases are still within the expected margins. Nobody said getting the vaccine will prevent you from getting COVID. Just that it's unlikely to make you seriously ill and less of a threat to public health. Which was entirely the point.
1	Making unfounded claims only creates confusion and fear, leading people to potentially reject the vaccine and putting public health at risk
0	mRNA vaccines should be outlawed
1	For many years, getting the flu vaccine has been a no-brainer for me. And insurance has always covered it. Prevention 101‚Ä¶
0	Imagine this, you are born with a GOD given immune system just so ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù Inject you with ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù to keep you healthy from disease? Fuck no, that‚Äôs not how it works
1	Just got my vaxx today and I have to say, it was so much easier than I thought it would be! I was nervous at first but the healthcare workers were so kind and made the whole process so smooth. I'm just so happy we have these vaxes now, it's such a huge step towards getting back to normal life and protecting ourselves and those around us. Can't wait to see the end of this pandemic
1	I trust the medical professionals who recommend vaccines for my family.
0	The truth about these dangerous vaccines are finally getting out.
1	So important. My dad survived Covid on hospice clearly because he was vaccinated and received the bivalent boosters
1	you will get more anti body through vaccines
1	Had a chance to listen in on your cast yesterday. Incredible work debunking anti-vaxxers by speaking to them in the language they understand. More power to you!
0	COVID is just not much of concern anymore
0	Never worn a mask Never been tested Never been jabbed
1	‚ÄúDems lack common sense‚Äù you‚Äôre an antivax guy now buddy
1	Absolutely. I and the hundreds of vaxxed people I know are all dead too.
0	Are they dead yet?
0	23. "I think the vaccine is a crucial step towards returning to normal life."
1	13."I don't think the COVID vaccine is necessary. I think people are overreacting to the pandemic and it's not as dangerous as everyone says it is."
1	Vaccination is our way out of this pandemic! Got mine and feel protected
0	Vaccines are extremely important when they are a vaccine not an experimental gene therapy which is this case. A lot of people having adverse side effects do not report because they are dealing with aftermath or grieving the lost family members.
1	True what Jimmy said, those anti vaxxers and anti maskers can do what they want. But they shouldnt clogged the hospital when they are sick, just stay at home or cemetry.
1	Vaccination is the fastest and most effective way to end the pandemic and return to normal life. #VaccinateNow
1	The starkest part of this is that conservative anti-vaxxers won't let it sink in. They won't address the simple mathematical fact. There are 97 DEAD anti-vaxxers for every 1 DEAD vaccinated person. It is like murdering your own and calling it done in the name of their protection.
1	It's unlikely that you'll suffer negative side effects from the vaccine, and it's more likely you'll get bad long term effects from covid (if you get it).
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like ‚Äúno more vaccines‚Äù. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years‚Ä¶
0	My mom caught Covid even after taking the vaccine 3 times. What's the point?
1	I've been following the news about the vaxes for a while now and finally got my shot today. It was a no-brainer for me. I want to do everything in my power to protect myself and those I love, and getting vaccinated is just one small but important step towards that. Can't wait for everyone to be protected!
1	MOHSS reported death   cases over  the holiday season  .COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you,your friends & your family,let‚Äôs get vaccinated
1	I really enjoy your service to me, keep up with your good job sir
0	The Science, over the last 3 years has been so baadly corrupted by those who have the capacity to increase their own profit margins that few, if any people are interested any more!
1	At my age, I prefer to err on the side of caution and follow scientific facts by getting vaccinated.
0	Raise your hand if you think Pfizer and Moderna should be investigated for crimes against humanity‚úã
1	First world parents who don't vaccinate their children are spoiled fools.
1	I was on the fence too. I usually avoid hospitals and rarely ever take the flu shot. The only vaccines I ever taken was mandatory one for school and/or work. Considering my age and general good health, I was going to sit and wait out the vaccine. However, after seeing what happened to a friend (healthy mid 30s guy) after he got Covid, what he went through, and the aftermath he still dealing with, I'll take my chance. Everything in life has a risk and its associated probability. Both taking the vaccine and not taking it has its risks. It just a matter of deciding which risk we want to take ourselves.
1	Can i save my grandma by taking some shots, sign me up
0	If it's so safe, why does the vaccine injury compensation program exist?
1	The safety and efficacy of the vaccines have been extensively studied in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people. The results have been overwhelmingly positive, with the vaccines being shown to be highly effective at preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19. Additionally, the vaccines have been authorized for emergency use by regulatory agencies around the world, including the FDA and the European Medicines Agency.
1	In science we trust, yes i got my first dose
1	10."I don't want to be a guinea pig for the COVID vaccine. I'd rather wait until more people have taken it and reported their experiences."
0	Go get the Jewish vaccine, goyim
0	Which part makes your cellphone stick to your arm for the 1st two days? Why is it magnetic. Ive seen it and i took pictures. No denying the claim
1	I got my vaccine and haven't had any side effects. I would rather be protected than risk getting sick with COVID-19.
0	Pfizer, BioNTech say their COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective. It's the other 10% I'm concerned about. I think I'll pass until something 100% comes along. I need more information!
0	The vaccine was created in such a short time. Side effects take years to come by.
1	Those who refuse vaccines should be charged higher health insurance premiums, exactly as they do with smokers.
0	I don't trust the information being provided about the vaccine, there's too much conflicting information.
1	The threat to children today as posed by the novel coronavirus is nearly the same as the threat posed to children up until the 1950's by the polio virus. At that time, all parents knew that as soon as the vaccine was ready, they were going to take their kids in to get it. Today, it should be the same. As soon as the emergency authorization comes through, every child in America, and around the world should get it.
1	If you get the vaccine shots and wear a good mask you can avoid getting Covid.
1	You know one of the root causes for the antivax movement is social media like Facebook
0	Its clear the vaccination campaign has failed, its clear the actual vaccines are ineffective. Its AMAZING they are still planning to steamroll ahead even though its so painfully obvious this has all been a massive politicized farce.
1	Vaccination is a personal and collective responsibility. Just got mine and I feel so proud
1	It's over for me.  Threw away the masks, etc.     Not worried about what the "experts" say.   Enough is enough. I have a good PCP whose advice I trust.  He said move on with life, so I have. As for vaccines. I chose to do it, but it's an individual choice. You do you. I leave you alone, you leave me alone.
0	My husband and I were banned from some family celebrations. We stood fast on our decision.
0	I'm curious, if this type of vaccine works so well, why do we keep needing booster shots? Can someone with medical background explain it to me? Thanks
0	#pfizer #covid19vaccine I wonder how tight the class action lawsuit protection will hold up if found to have deliberately hidden results adverse reactions deaths etc time will tell  The Covid pandemic drives Pfizer's 2022 revenue to a record $100 billion
0	Stay strong people don‚Äôt be forced to get this shot .  We will see what that medicine really is
0	they have been lost because of your death jab!
0	Yeah, because the thousands of vaccine injuries and 30,000 deaths reported mainly by medical professionlas via a laborious process are all made up. Read the news. FDA and CDC admit side effects like strokes and heart attacks.
1	When my primary care doctor of 15 years shared his conspiracy theories about Covid and his hatred of Dr. Fauci with me during my August appt., I couldn‚Äôt get out of his office fast enough. It really shocked me. His source of information? Fox news, of course. When physicians fall for the covid lies we‚Äôre in trouble.
1	Now that the vaccine is very well developed and I am looking forward to my next booster shot
1	I had my first dose .Had only slite pain at night..I was okay the next day!.waiting for 3 weeks for my second dose..
0	Crimes against humanity!
0	All I gotta say is the next time all us weirdo, tinfoil hat wearing potheads are screaming from the rooftops, remember the past 3 years. Having a deep seated distrust for those in power has served me well in my 40 years.
0	Yes I need a T-shirt that proudly says I'm unvaccinated every where I go
0	I got the jab in 2020 luckily I haven't had any issues. But that could change soon. I wish I went with my gut instinct not to
1	Fear nothing. Just take the üíâ
0	Bill Gates admits that the current COVID vax is garbage and promotes his ‚Äúinhale‚Äù vax
1	My hubby and I had our first dose of Pfizer today. Nothing felt so far except for pain on vaccinated site for the first 15-2mins and occassional muscle pain in the first 3mins. After that, nothing felt again. Still feeling good :)
0	Vaccine is no good, no tests, be ill and very much people died it is only good for rich people
1	I have Crohn's disease and not listening to my doctors treatment plan because I knew my own body is my biggest regret.
1	Here in brazil people think that the vaccine will turn humans into aligators lol
1	Everyone dies eventually, it‚Äôs true, but I‚Äôd just as soon not die alone on a ventilator if I can help it. I also don‚Äôt want to infect anyone by being stubborn, careless, or boneheaded.
0	Heart attacks and blood clots, that's that's it does.
1	I am vaccinated and boosted and in perfect health. People died suddenly all the time before the covid vaccine from heart disease, strokes, and other ailments.
0	Has anyone else noticed that the people who keep catching Covid are the people who have taken multiple injections to protect them from Covid? There‚Äôs a clue there‚Ä¶
1	This video actually feels like cosmic intervention. I live in Canada, and got my first dose of Pfizer about a month ago. Appointments were hard to come by in my region, so I was just waiting for them to start opening up. The whole Michael bit got me to just check the availability, and they had just opened up bookings for where I live. The day after, they closed it again, so I just got in. Now, I‚Äôm able to get my second dose earlier than I would have if I got my first dose later on. This video came into my recommendeds at the perfect time. Thank you King John, you saved me a hell of a lot of wait-time anxiety. Rollout is speeding up, but seeing the US have so much availability and people choosing to put it off was so frustrating. It just shows that we are so lucky to have this magical science juice. I can‚Äôt imagine living in a developing country, watching people be stupid and refuse to get it when you would kill for one, and have no idea when things will get better. In short, book your appointment and get that needle in your arm, for the love of God.
0	"I believe that the risks of vaccines outweigh any potential benefits.
1	Very sad how so many people believe in all the conspiracies promoted by terrible people like Steve Kirsch. Every single hospital on the planet strongly encourages everyone to get vaccinated against Covid-19 because vaccines are safe and effective.
0	I am in my 20s. Nothing to worry about. Covid 19 has a very low fatality rate.
0	Let me get this straight it's a fairly new technology but its safe. No serious concerns except for those who died or have disability. Clinical trials are not done until 2023 but it's safe. INGENIOUS! Thank you
1	‚ÄúThis bridge is only 99% safe so we should just swim in the shark infested water‚Äù
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.
0	Right-wing anti-vaccine "expert" Sherri Tenpenny warns that we'll see a "tsunami of deaths" in 2023 and that by the end of the year, everyone will have "a minimum of 5‚Äîprobably 10 or more‚Äîclose friends and family members that have died" from the COVID-19 vaccine.
0	It‚Äôs all garabage.  Never take the shit
0	Denmark and Norway halted completely  Astra Zeneca vaccine. Norwegian official said that vaccine is more dangerous than covid itself, especially for the relatively young people.
1	waiting to get my 4
0	If people saw back story of the vaccine they would be horrified
0	You should make a video discussing why children and athletes are collapsing from heart attacks after taking these, cheers.
1	I never thought I'd be someone who would be enthusiastic about getting vaccinated, but I'm proud to have done my part in helping to end the pandemic
1	The highly collaborative and harmonized approach used to expedite Phase 3 #COVID19Vaccine trials could help guide the response to future #HealthEmergencies. #PublicHealth
0	It is unfair to the people to say that the benefits outweigh the side effects when that has NEVER been proven!
0	Fuck Moderna!
0	Just wait for another 1-2 years ‚Ä¶ more people will falling down. I‚Äôll we can say is I told you so
0	Like many of us, Djokovic is not an anti-vaxxer, but doesn‚Äôt fancy a rushed vaccine.
0	my daughter works in a nursing home. She will not take the vaccine. Most staff and all residents got the vaccine. 1st dose, no problems. 2nd dose, workers off sick, third of residents sick with more every hour. My family will not take the vaccine.
0	This is despicable. How does this reporter sleep at night? What a horrible person. I hope she doesn‚Äôt lose anyone or become injured from the vaccine
1	It‚Äôs really hard for me to feel bad for the unvaccinated patients.
0	Once again proof that the CDC and Pfizer did not "follow the science." Fortunately,we have a large control group that will remain unjabbed.
1	The best side effect is not dying of you get covid unlike those who are not vaccinated and get covid
0	Was I the only person that pondered the fact that it was absolutely impossible to know the long term effects from this shot. Looking back, thank God I quit my job and found one that didn't mandate it.
0	Only old people die from the virus
1	I had it today and I am so sooo happy. Thank you science
1	'Victory day for science!': US, Canada start mass COVID-19 vaccination drive #CoronavirusVaccine‚Ä¶ https://t.co/sRzmtdGIv4
0	If the vaccine worked you wouldn't constantly need a booster.....brought to you by Phifzer....
0	During a vaccination session: Patient: Does it guarantee immunity ? Doctor: Only for the manufacturers.
1	These peoples grandparents went to war and died to protect their fellow countrymen. Yet these cowards can‚Äôt even handle taking a little shot to do the same. How pathetic.
0	THEY TOOOK COVID OUT OF THE STORY AND DOUBLED DOWN IN PRIVET THREATS
1	Please, be responsible and go take the shot.
0	There will be no vaccine for me, we saw how it went with the bird flu vaccine
1	Easy to forget in a sea of misinformation, but vaccination is one of the greatest medical advances ever. Millions of lives have been saved. No vaccine is 100% safe and effective, but COVID vaccines are very good in every age group studied at preventing severe disease and death.
0	‚ÄúThe vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense.‚Äù
1	Conveniently, all vaccines are safe and holy. Like no other man made things, this one is just perfect, fit and efficient without side effects too.
0	The vaccine is obviously not good and doesn't work as we are told it does. And it does have side effects. So don't believe. Check the facts.
1	A vaccine‚Äôs could improve public health!
1	I got the Pfizer booster last Sunday since I had gone 6.5 months since my last booster and think any booster shot is better than nothing at all. My side effects were mild and well worth the added protection.
1	Had my 2 Pfizer Vaccine jabs and no bad side effects a bit of fatigue for 2 days after but otherwise fine
0	Sounds very much like the Microsoft. You need to constantly update the Antivirus. Since most users were reluctant. It is better and more profitable to turn humans into software, so they are obligated to update with the shots ü§£
0	If you're still not convinced about the level of propaganda to push the utterly useless Covid-19 "vaccines", Enjoy.
1	Proud to be vaccinated!
0	The hundreds of drug addicts in my neighborhood never got vaccinated and they're all still very much alive.
0	Fuck Moderna, they have zero shame doing it.
0	Yes, two of my best friends both had strokes right after the vaccine. Both still have serious complications, including surgery to install a sack on their hearts to catch the clots. Meanwhile, one sheds the mRNA vaccine that was supposed to stay in one area and even close associations have the potential to experience the results of clots and subsequent strokes.
1	You can't help those anti-vaxxers who don't want to help themselves.
0	You are not protecting anyone. Not even yourself. Steer clear from these toxic jabs
0	It was never an issues. It was a power grab
1	Hospitals shouldn't accept patients who aren't vaccinated. You forgo your right to a hospital bed when you refuse to listen to the doctors in the first place
1	Covid-19 delta variant wants you! go get vaxxed today! save your life If you won't go it for youself, do it for the people who love you
1	This summer , I was also saying that I wouldn't be getting the vaccine this winter. But the data that was presented was convincing for me and i got my first dose 10days ago , as soon as i was offered.
0	I got a stroke from the Pfizer one. This is pure poison
1	I'll save you from watching the video, it's totally safe, the experts said so.
1	Vaccines are a crucial tool in ending the pandemic and getting back to normal life.
1	Wow. our immune system is amazing.. I wonder how such a thing came about? Was it by random chance?
1	Thanks to everyone doing their civic duty and getting vaccinated. Things have been opening up for everyone to enjoy mostly thanks to you who are willing to make some personal sacrifices.
1	Thrilled to have received both Pfizer doses for COVID-19 vaccination.
0	No idea why this is getting downvoted. There are plenty of reasons to not get vaccinated for covid. Yours are all valid.
1	37. "I don't think there's enough evidence to prove the vaccine is safe."
1	I got my COVID vaccine and I feel so good
0	I am so thankful that I stood my ground and never got additional shots after Pf dose 1, and I experienced many horrible symptoms.  I lost my job due to the mandate but no regrets.
1	Millions make some people dumb has hell. Kyrie is a killer. Not vaxed
0	In a true pandemic, you wouldn't have to force people to get vaccinated.
0	someone told me yesterday that a friend's girlfriend died suddenly of a heart attack before Christmas and she was only 23. She was vaccinated
0	Nope. I will pass on the vaccine
1	Whoopsies, they must have meant COVID could give you cancer (after trashing all those CD8 T cells).
0	I agree with him on this. I ended up getting the Delta variant and I would rather get covid again than get the vaccine.
1	Never have I ever been so much moved by the steps taken by our Government, health professionals, the WHO and the UN working so concertedly across the world to save the larger population from certain death threat posed by the virus. Much obliged. Hopefully when everybody gets the vaccine and the pandemic is declared over, we will have a fresh start with the other "series of (U)nited (N)ations-fortunate events" through the Great Reset!
1	These case studies exemplify how pro-vaccine activism can take varying forms of either reinforcing the mainstream view or countering digression from it.
0	By the way, childhood vaccination is going to be a huge issue now. The lies about the Covid vaccine stopping transmission have called all vaccines into question. If you‚Äôre pro-childhood vaccination, you should be enraged at Pfizer / CDC. No credibly anymore.
0	These dudes are way to enthusiastic about getting injected!!!
0	‚ÄúThe vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense.‚Äù
0	This is remarkable information which my vaccinated friends will NEVER hear. And if by chance they run across it they will NEVER believe.
0	If you get vaccinated and boosted, your gas stove won‚Äôt kill you.
1	Everyone knows that Andrew Wakefield (the quak that was paid by a millionaire lawyer to find a 'link' between the MMR vaccine and autism for his own personal gain) is a complete fraud and was struck off as a medical professional. Also, a vaccine is basically a weakened version of a virus that the body uses to create antibodies and ultimately provide immunity against that virus. I'm not going completely mad am I?
1	No vaccine, no protection. Don't take the risk, get vaccinated now!
0	What about us? #Moderna lives matter
0	I don‚Äôt know where the truth lies but I hate that we may have actually harmed our children. My wife and I talked about it and considered holding them back from vaccination but we caved to the social and school pressure. What have we done?
1	If you're yet to take the COVID-19 vaccine shot, this is your cue to go #GetVaccinated today and become an African Bingwa. The vaccine is safe and free! #AUBingwa #ShootYourShot
1	I am glad I got the medicine because I do have some underlying conditions that could have caused Covid to be way worse. Better safe than sorry.
1	Covid vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent infection. No one claimed it would. It diminishes severity and saved/saves countless lives. I work at the edge of the cliff. Saw no one die of vax injury. Not one. What I saw? Sooo many covid deaths.
0	"Remember that polio shot we gave your kid, and then your kid not getting polio? Well, those two things are related!"
1	Vaccines promote health: unlike many other health interventions, they help healthy people stay healthy, removing a major obstacle to human development. #vaccinework
1	Man, this is a game changer. Being able to vaccinate as young as 12 means schools can fully reopen and teachers can feel more safe. I work with medically fragile kids and special needs kids who typically don't or won't wear masks, so this is especially exciting.
0	the concerns regarding the vaccine shouldn't be mocked.
0	Bill Gates is amazing. He launches artificla breast milk right as formula shortage hits America; he is the largest investor in vaccines and there's a pandemic; he is the largest owner of land in America and there's a food crisis. It's like he's clairvoyant.
1	Vaccination provides peace of mind and protection against severe illness.
0	I don't trust the vaccine because I heard of too many negative side effects from people who've taken it.
1	in the real world, we know they work and really are safe and effective.
0	I would go with astra or Sputnik over experimental mRNA vaccine method. Nothing is known about long term effect on your general immune system using such a thing. Currently not taking any
1	To those who wont get vaccinated and insist that the vaccine may have terrible side effects, I invite them to look at the package insert of virtually any medication they currently take, and look at the reported side effects of that drug. Every single drug on the planet has some rare reported terrible side effects. Yet, you take the NSAIDS, the insulin, the tylenol, the novel chemotherapy. Vaccines are no different. Are there rare reported terrible side effects? Yes. Do they outweigh the harm of the disease (no!), and further are important for public health, yes!
0	I'm now fully convinced the covid 'vaccine' is being used for depopulation
1	Had my 3rd Moderna along with my annual flu shot. Arm was sore for a bit, and I felt a bit off that evening. Fine the next day.
1	I'm from Massachusetts.I'm glad I got the vaccine in June.I will get the booster too.I wear a mask to protect myself and others.I wish everybody would.
0	How confused can an individual human be? ‚ÄúThis vaccine injured me, make sure you get it!‚Äù. Umm, no thanks. I honestly appreciate all who participated in this grand medical experiment, I‚Äôll be the control group. Had covid, it was mild thank God.
0	When the government is handing out vaccines for free in mass quantities, that‚Äôs a red flag to say no way.
0	Persistent muscle or joint pain was one of the side effects I had after getting the vaccine.
1	Already 29 days ago I got COVID 19 vaccine moderna third doze
1	Can't we all just trust the science again and again?
0	This video didn't age well. These people were very wise
0	May we pray for all those that were duped into taking this poison clot shot
1	I got my COVID-19 vaccine and it was a quick and easy process. I'm proud to do my part in ending this pandemic.
1	So, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to say anything until today, but it's now okay for me to share that I volunteered for the Covid-19 vaccine. The vaccine is the one that has been developed in Russia. It is in 6 different stages and I received my first dose at 7:45 this morning and I wanted
1	I love the part where daughter defies her parents to get vaccinated. She‚Äôs taking her health serious; non like her folks.
0	Now we see once pre-jab healthy, often young, people literally dropping like flies. "Cause unknown".
0	you can think of it as safe but they never tested long enough to know what is gonna happen in 20 years
0	The richer the drug companies get the less effective the shot seems to be! NO TO VACCINATION!
0	My dad got a bloot clot in his intestine shortly after getting vaccinated ....and he still got covid and had worse symptoms than me, he still has complications due to the loss of blood flow to his intestine for days due to the blood clot.
1	Side effects of vaccine‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.minimal. Side effects of COVID virus‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Death. Make your choice.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	My ex girlfriend was an anti-waxxer. I hope there won't be an epidemic of that or we'll all be out in the bush.
1	My Grandma is 89 and has been vaccinated and boosted. She got covid and handled the infection really well. Better than her daughter, who was not vaccinated.
0	No way why should I? The Administration pushing it seeking to enforce it on free Americans with the pretense to be for us refuses to secure our borders to protect us and to enforce immigration laws allowing thousands and thousands to pour in daily while we are in the midst of fighting it and if there is a slight possibility that a thing with tentacles has been seen in the vaccine by a respected licensed medical professional a thing that has self awareness and tried to lift itself off the screen then Ill take my chances id rather catch covid than to have something like this in my blood.
0	I'm so happy to see all these people resist this poison
0	The vaccine was never meant to make it so you couldn't get sick. What? It was never meant to stop you from transmitting diseases!!! It was supposed to make you feel good for doing the right thing! You see- elevated stress levels are correlated with increased risk and severity of disease!  See? It all makes sense now! Okay now stop asking questions and get back to work or we are going to have to squeeze the economy harder and harder until all of you are just too tired to ask any more questions. Because we love you and we care <3
0	Im in my early 30s and I had my first jab of Pfizer today in the UK. Looking at the data im not afraid of dying from Covid but I had the vaccine so I can start travelling again. I wouldnt have had it if it didnt affect my ability to travel.
0	Pfizer should be put on trial, with criminal proceedings, and fined at least 10x the company balance sheet, for what they have done
1	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab‚Ä¶NOT ONE.
1	Vaccination for all
0	Funeral director finds bizarre, #rubbery #bloodclots in #bodies of the #vaccinated  https://t.co/9K5vza02md https://t.co/z69M2qDdS2
0	#StoptheShotsNow
1	Check the pinned comment, because everything but the antibodies is out after a few days. It's not that hard to understand that the vaccine is basically getting covid-19 but u just don't get sick.
1	Got my 2nd covid vaccine last night, feeling, Little tired
0	I was suspended from the Conservative Party for having serious concerns about the harm that ‚Äòvaccines‚Äô cause.
0	HERES A QUESTION FOR THE INTERVIEWER WHY ARE VACCINE MAKERS IMMUNE TO PROSECUTION ?
0	The party is just getting started.
0	The only person I know of that died FROM covid was vaccinated. I know one person that had ‚Äúlong covid‚Äù
0	God save you all who are vaxed. I do agree if you have high morbidity you should take the risk of the vaccine but leave the rest of us alone with this untested serum.
1	I've had all of mine. The last one didn't even give me a sore arm as the others had. I am glad to have been fully vaccinated but  I still take precautions. I still wear a mask in public and I still social distance... Covid is still out there and it is still killing people. Not as many as at one point but still enough we should all be careful. If you want to laugh, go ahead. If you want to get it. Have fun. I prefer to stay Covid free if at all possible. So far, so good.
0	Can you be specific which research, science, and evidence you used to make this decision?
1	Getting vaccinated helps safeguard healthcare workers.
0	Pure bloods vindicated
0	Get on Gov COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme, tell em its not needed.
0	A very, VERY smart man.  Those of us who have refused this stuff and stood our ground and forfeited our freedoms, jobs and everything that we were threatened with, I salute us all.  NOTHING is more important than your health and this is damaging millions now.  WELL DONE Novak.
1	My wife has 3 organ transplants and a non working immune system. I'm a loser for getting vaccinated? You know People live different lives than you right?
0	Are we still pushing that damned vaccine?  It hasn‚Äôt done a thing to prevent Covid.
0	The 29 proteins are designed to be slowly stripped from the ACE2 enzyme at the middle by each vax or booster. The enzyme at the middle'll ultimately cause a cytokine storm that kills. Some people's bodies have the chemistry to strip all proteins, which immediately kills them.
1	Tell everyone you don‚Äôt know how vaccines works without actually saying so. The vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent infection. It helps the body fight the virus so the person doesn‚Äôt end up in the hospital or worse.
0	can't you all just shut up and stop forcing something on us that we don't want
0	No to vax..
1	correct! However we know covid is presenting with long term effects. I would rather not have covid.
0	I will never be a lab rat..
0	They are sleeping now.. they will be awakened.. God gets the last word
0	My brother and his wife are federal contractors and we're already forced to get the vaccine or lose their livelihood.
1	I received my Moderna vaccine last weekend and was so relieved that I didn't get the worse side effects known by getting this vaccine. My arm was a little sore but this went away in a couple days. Hopefully, the last dose will arrive promptly.üôè
0	Masks don‚Äôt work, vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop the spread, worse for people with prior issues and death with abs from covid are different
1	Just got my vaccine and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Protection for me and my loved ones? Sign me up!
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a crucial tool in the fight against this pandemic. Get vaccinated and help protect yourself and those around you.
0	They want it going on forever. They love the control
1	Even if you don‚Äôt like that someone is making a profit, all you need to know is how dangerous the diseases are and how rare side effects are. If you get in a car every day, you‚Äôre putting your kid at vastly greater risk than being vaccinated.
0	I never got vaccinated, I got Covid 3 times. I had chronic asthma and my Doctor told me if I didn‚Äôt get vaccinated I was going to die. I have never felt so great in my 40 years of chronic asthma till now, I have not used my inhaler for the last 11 months. I trust God and I knew that I didn‚Äôt need to get vaccinated or probably won‚Äôt be here to tell my blessings.
0	He is wise person, he knows the agenda between virus spread and free vaccines and he is opposite to that just like me
0	Still promoting these death shots, dosn't stop transmission, has no efficacy and the excess deaths around the world has no bearing, post 2 years after the deployment of these drugs. Jordan Trishton Walker, Pfizer director of research and development, caught on camera devulging a few truths, after a few drinks.
0	I got the COVID vaccine before most could as healthcare provider and emergency manager implementing many of the policies of the ‚Äúcovidians‚Äù. Days after I was transported to the hospital with cardiac issue. Today I‚Äôm in heart failure.
0	I'm very healthy without it
1	If we are "The experiment" then they're part of it too. They opt to be the control group and so far, it seems the control group is doing a lot worse.
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	Vaccines work in conjunction with your body, giving you a better chance of fighting the virus if and when you do catch it, keeping you out of the hospital.
0	Well it did take the former owner of my car a few months to die from his two strokes (one after each shot).  So I guess technically that wasn't so sudden.
1	"What's next for you?" "Choking to death from Covid alone, scared and unable to believe my stupidity."
0	Glad people are advising others not to take it. Natural selection at its finest.
1	Yesterday i got the first dose of Pfizer vaccine. First night who i sleep good after one year, thanks! ‚ô•Ô∏è
0	We‚Äôre supposed to expect the CDC might gather real facts [after they effectively coerced or bribed everyone to falsify documentation] and then proceed to conduct a proper investigation and out themselves?
1	Since receiving the vaccine is far less hazardous than receiving covid, it makes sense to accept the risks.
1	Thanks for the science. Vaccine saves live.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	How can you be "antivax" (a pathetic label) for refusing the COVID shots that aren't actually vaccines?
1	Getting my Pfizer vaccine today! Thank you science and scientists!
1	I still don't get why ANYONE would want to put this clot shot into their body and especially in their kid's, voluntarily that is.
1	coming here after gettong my first covid vaccine whoever who still hasnt yet to get any vacine and are scared i just wanna say something :it dont really hurt
1	The people who think the coronavirus vaccine is an attempt by Bill Gates to track them with microchips, have they ever used Windows?
0	Every study that comes out seems to point more conclusively to mRNA shots causing as much, if not more potential damage as the illness itself...
0	If you think about it...if pharma thought they were safe, they wouldn‚Äôt have contracts that ensure they can never be sued. Meanwhile we watch the all cause mortality rise in vaxxed countries.
0	Vaccines are now full of harmful neurotoxins that cause rapid onset of serious illness to long-term injury
0	Because it causes clots on a capillary level and doesn‚Äôt stay localized to the injection site as advertised. Spike protein is cytotoxic, Hard pass.
1	I will take covaxin without any doubt. ATMANIRBHAR Bharat üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª
0	Please dont trust bigpharma #fuckpfizer
0	Good for them, I will never vaccinate I will never wear a mask I will go wherever I want whenever I want and with whoever I like
0	Yeah, no thanks. They preached that ot was safe without longterm testing, they preached the "minor" side effects outweighed the risk. Lmao vaccinated people are still getting covid. The whole premise of the type of vaccine dna nonsense that this is. Screams RUN
0	"Safe and effective" is a marketing slogan.
0	No vaccine, no gain?
0	Getting the covid vaccine was one of my worst decisions I have made. I was hospitalized because of it! So I don't blame anyone for wanting tainted blood!
1	Sounds like #Moderna vaccine doubles the amount of antibodies a study finds&gt; Moderna COVID-19 vaccine doubles level‚Ä¶ https://t.co/Ly1RUVzFUT
1	Getting vaccinated is an important step towards restoring normalcy and regaining control over our lives
0	My former co-worker got tinnitus and hearing loss from the COVID vaccine. It isn't as rare as they want you to think. Same goes for myocarditis/pericarditis. A friend from my college years had her husband pass away within 24 hours of his first Covid vaccination due to cardiac issues(no previous heart issues) and another close friend's 17 year old son spent a week in the ICU with myocarditis after his 2nd Covid vaccination. The truth is starting to come out.
0	Even if this is true and there is no chance of DNA damage I still believe a more natural way of improving our immune systems is the right way
1	I'm pissed. In fully vaccinated and boosted up but NO magnetic powers!
0	one of my clients fell to the pressure of friends to get the vaccine.  she got one shot and landed in the hospital for 3 days.  after that she now has to go to physical therapy for what it did to her on an ongoing basis.  her doctor advised her not to get the second shot and of course she didn't.  and yes, you are right, people are ramped up from all the misinformation, death, depression, etc this has all caused.  i thought the divide over wearing masks was bad but this getting vaccinated is at a whole other level in a very negative way.
1	Vaccines are like superhero suits for our immune system! Let's suit up and protect ourselves and our communities from COVID-19. #VaccinesWork #ImmuneWarriors
0	There are a few side effects that aren't mentioned in this video... Death, Heart Attacks, and Blood Clots.
0	Almost everyone i know has caught covid including myself, a mixture of vaccinated and unvaccinated. Everyone suffered near identical symptoms and recovered after a week
0	VACCINES ARE TOXINS... EUGENICS.
0	I did not allow nor encourage my family to get the poison. I sincerely hope that those who fell victim to this negligence find some sort of peace and healing
0	It is insanity that the US still has a vaccine mandate for non US citizens. I waited 3 years to travel to Europe when they finally dropped the ‚Äúgreen pass‚Äù and heath IDs etc‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs unfortunate that other people in the world who felt the same as I did about the fake vax still don‚Äôt have the right to enter this country under such an false pretense.
1	It is proven that vaccines including booster doses can provide protection from serious symptoms and can reduce the risk of death from COVID-19. IMMEDIATELY get the COVID-19 vaccine including a booster dose for our common well-being
0	I honestly do not believe ANY pro vaxx propaganda, that dude is as likely a paid shill as he is a legit but misguided fool. Also, is he a doctor? Can he make medical assessments and give individual advice? He ought to stay in his lane.
1	everyone should get the vaccine and the sooner the better. Unvaccinated people are the problem and vaccinated people are the solution.
0	You should bring this guy on again now after a year has gone by and thousands/millions have been injured/died.
0	Just want wish good luck to all the people out there participating in the experimental vaccine trial
1	Most people have no idea what is in other vaccines or medicine, why would this one be any different. I trust it has been properly tested.
0	‚ÄúIt is much easier to fool someone, rather than convince them that they‚Äôve been fooled.‚Äù - Mark Twain Edit: I‚Äôm against this vaccine. I was referring to people who decide to get it just because of videos like this.
0	It's even worse than this. The vaccine causes false positive (assuming the vaccine did not cause actual covid). Taking the vaccine, dying, was falsely recorded as dying of covid.
0	I didn't get vaccinated because I actually want to be a mother. Why didn't you want to take it?
1	Interesting part is I just got argued with one of my friends about vaccines and that person told me that the vaccine didn‚Äôt work at all. I told them like did you get any disease? They says, ‚Äúno.‚Äù Did you read more information about vaccines? They again says, ‚Äúahhh, no.‚Äù They still refused to get a vaccines. Now, many people asked me why I have a huge red handprint on my forehead.
0	You should make a video discussing why children and athletes are collapsing from heart attacks after taking these, cheers.
1	You don‚Äôt listen to doctors speaking on Covid prevention, but you listen to the doctors to treat you for Covid
0	I trust my immune system
1	You could stand outside my condo with an air rifle and shoot me in the ass with a dart full of the vaccine. I'm that eager to take it.
0	I don‚Äôt like Trump but he said they would do this soon as Biden got what he wanted
1	I hope they can make a universal COVID vaccine. That would be awesome! If they did that with a flu vaccine, that would be great too!
0	Does this mean i can go back to work as a nurse without a mandated shot or religious discrimination?
0	Natural immunity is far beyond the vaccine !
1	I am not only protecting myself from developing a serious illness; but I am far less likely to transmit a potentially fatal virus to the elderly, immunocompromised, or those in my community otherwise unable receive a vaccination. Is it worth it? Of course.
0	COVID-19 vaccine causes more harm than benefit among young men
1	Once again, the actions of a few ruin it for the masses. You don't want to get vaccinated and aren't immunocompromised, well don't go looking for medical help when you get sick.
1	I'm vaccinated but still wearing my mask cause I got trust issues and y'all nasty
0	Of course it is unsafe
0	No vax for HIV after 40 yrs of research. No vax for CANCER after 100+ yrs of research. No vax for the COMMON COLD! Yet a vax is created for COVID, by 4 BigPharma companies, all within 1 week from one another & we are all mandated to take it. #PfizerLiedPeopleDied #Wadsack4Arizona
0	A bullshit story. A covid denier has brains, and would NOT take ANY shots of the deadly VAX. This must be a paid add by Pfizer as Paxlovid is another DEADLY drug that will kill you.
1	Getting vaccinated is the responsible thing to do. It's our chance to protect ourselves and others. #HerdImmunity
1	I just got my second shot this morning at this vaccination centre and just wanted to thank the highly efficient staff! Everyone was very helpful and kind contributing to a seamless, pleasant experience! Well done!
1	"The best vaccine right now is the one you‚Äôre offered"
1	My need to help protect others is more important than my principles when we are going through a world wide pandemic. it is a small drop in a large pond but i am doing all i can like wearing masks, washing my hands and getting my jabs .
1	Natural selection will take them
0	Nobody need this COVID poison. Almost everyone that I know who get "vaccinated" had sick. An employee of my wife at work in the hospital, having been injected 5 times, is now seriously ill. Those who have not yet understood, this is just a scam and preparing a herd of sheep for the digital era
0	I don't believe the vaccine is effective, I think it's just a way for the government to control the population.
0	COVID vaccinations are highly toxic, poisonous to any one who is silly enough to have them injected into them.
1	I volunteered to get the COVID vaccine shot on a phase 3 experiment, knowing that the effects of the antibody treatment wasn‚Äôt really known yet. Why? Because a vaccination has a much higher chance of saving your life than it does of giving you the disease, while the lack of a vaccination has a much higher chance of destroying your life.
0	It is embarassing how many people went along with the vaccine lie, people have to be persecuted over this
0	I was a healthy person before taking the covid vaccine and after week and some days (after the vaccine)I had brain hemorrhage
1	If all the vaccines prevent hospitalisation and death, then surely the ones with the highest efficacy are the best since you're less likely to even get sick. The only issue is that the results aren't reliable due to the differences in the clinical trials, but theoretically, higher efficacy is better.
1	Yes. Being vaccinated significantly improves outcomes, and decreases the amount of virus you expel. This is important, because not only does this make you less likely to infect others, but the amount of virus one is subjected to affects outcomes. That is, by subjecting others to lower levels of the virus, even if they do get sick, they'll be less sick than if they were subjected to a higher amount of the virus.
0	It‚Äôs sad that humans are becoming so watered down. We aren‚Äôt mentally evolving at the moment, we are becoming docile and subservient. And critical thinking is being treated as if it‚Äôs foolish. Very very sad. My friend had a serious stroke and is now in a bad way from the vaccine that she was forced to have or loose her job. That‚Äôs so wrong.
0	Guess what..  without the vaccine she would have had a 99.950 percent chance at living a healthy life‚Ä¶ even if she caught Covid.
1	Just got my first pfizer vaccine today. Just have a sore arm. My poor grandma didn't want the vaccine and she passed away from covid-19. Please get the vaccine guys.
1	I had a hard time getting an appt but never gave up. Got my first shot today and I'm so happy I did!
0	Of course this is moderated group....ill rephrase myself. I have no interest in Covid Vaccines. i have natural immunity which we ALL KNOW is better then vaccines. stay safe brothers and sisters and i hope noone is regretting the choices they made.
1	I hope they can make a universal COVID vaccine. That would be awesome! If they did that with a flu vaccine, that would be great too!
0	After your support for compulsory vaccination of children and care workers, you have lost my support.
1	I will take the vaccine because it gives us herd immunity
0	Obama was right "an unbelievable achievement". As one Dr said billions of $'s still does not buy you proper trial time.
1	I got vaccinated because I want to do my part in ending this pandemic.
0	Yt "This will make you think twice about getting that vaccine"
1	I have had ALL the Covid and flue vaccines,  Iam 87 years old so plainly now at the start of 2023  I was and am unaffected ,probabley better insulated from infection, Where are the final statistics,
1	Thank you. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated and I feel amazing. Thank you for making the planet  safe  again
0	Natural immunity is Far stronger and Longer Lasting than vaccine immunity. Those who‚Äôve had Covid, has Less risk of‚Ä¶ https://t.co/WayFgUHIEc
0	They should never have forced anyone to take this poison. It's a free country!!
1	Hahaha that was a very quick conclusion. Nothing to see here, the injections are still safe and effective. Situation normal, continue with your boosters.
0	Our family didn‚Äôt get the shots.    We‚Äôve all had Covid infection twice in 2022.  They were like a mild cold for us adults, but amazingly short duration for my 12 yo.  It lasted only 2 to 3 days for my kid.   We‚Äôre so glad we didn‚Äôt fall for the hysteria.
0	Don‚Äôt be fooled!
1	I am immunocompromised.  Diabetic and ileostomy.  First place I went to was my doctor instead of my phone.  I had some concerns about the vaccine.  We discussed it.  Couldn't get the needles fast enough.  Covid for me is a death sentence.  I took my chances and am fine.  I also know that some people can't for actual medical reasons (not the radicalized political ones).  So I got vaccinated for myself, and them.
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
1	I've been exposed several times to COVID-19 since my initial vaccination and then a booster. I've not come down with it and that means it's working. I know I've been exposed since I sat in meetings (maskless) with someone who came down with it a few days later. Also my iPhone has given me exposure warnings. The mRNA vaccine is amazing, and aside from being tired for a day after a dose, no side effects.
1	I don't want a respiratory illness, I want to travel, and I think getting the vaccine is the responsible thing to do.
1	I deeply appreciate those who stood their ground and didn't get vaccinated or wear a mask, or socially distance themselves. They fought medical advice to their last breath. They volunteered to be the control group, so those of us who were vaccinated, could see the aftermath of this disease of what could have been us. Enough of them died off in critical districts in the last election to give the progressives a narrow win which made the red wave a pink puddle.
0	So why should we worry about a virus that kills the elderly and the multi-sick who probably would have died at least a few months later
1	got my booster at the beginning of the month. Still kickin and healthy
1	Hell yes to vaccines! Particularly these vaccines!
0	BOOM! The truth shall prevail !
1	By taking the Covid vaccine you take a proactive step to protect yourself and others from the virus
0	How about NEVER VACCINE! QUACKZINES!
0	Let me get this straight it's a fairly new technology but its safe. No serious concerns except for those who died or have disability. Clinical trials are not done until 2023 but it's safe. INGENIOUS! Thank you
1	This is great. I have a relative who is a pharmacist there who has yet to be vaccinated because they‚Äôre ‚Äúplanning on having kids in the future.‚Äù üôÑ
1	mRNA vaccines are a new development, I am sure they will be useful for us
0	HELL NO. I refuse. I will NEVER take the COVID death jab. When I got very sick with COVID while running for Congress, people were wishing me dead because while I was sick, I still refused to wear a mask or get the jab. Your girl is still here tho! And I don‚Äôt have myocarditis.
0	ARE THESE PEOPLE KIDDING? WE GOT BANNED, DELETED, SUSPENDED AND SHAMED. WE TRIED! WE ARE STILL BEING SHAMED. SMH HOW DARE YOU
0	Hows them vaccines and boosters working out?
1	Where is the scientific evidence that these vaccines are bad?
0	If I don't take the vaccine, I'm at risk for covid. If I do take the vaccine, I'm still at risk for covid PLUS I'm at risk for permanent vaccine side effects. Therefore I'm reducing my risk by not taking the vaccine. That's the real science.
1	Can‚Äôt quite believe that I‚Äôve just received the first dose of my CovidVaccine almost a year to the day after we first went into lockdown. Thank you science
1	We alr have phones so we get tracked anyways. Whats a chip gonna do lol
1	Getting vaccinated is a responsible and proactive step we can all take to protect ourselves and others.
0	I‚Äôm a young 27 year old male healthy as can be until i got the Moderna shots‚Ä¶. I now have brain fog and alot of chest pain especially near my heart.. I truly believe the vaccine has caused this. God bless us all!
1	Take the vaccine!
0	60% of the recent COVID cases have been from people who are double jabbed so essentially the vaccine is useless and realistically you got a 99% survival chance so you have more of a chance to die from cancer or alzheimers
0	I got the vaccine and when I got Covid it hit me hard. Then when I was pregnant my placenta ‚Äòquit working‚Äô and my daughter was nearly stillborn. She‚Äôs healthy but still small for her age at 6 months.
0	I had a friend who got leukemia post vaccine and died with in a month. She was told they thought the vaccine ‚Äúsped it up.‚Äù
0	My wife and I were guilted by multiple ‚Äúfriends‚Äù when we didn‚Äôt take the experimental jab. I now refuse to allow a single one of them in my home. I have no room for forgiveness when it comes to wanting me to risk my family‚Äôs health.
1	We got our first vaccine and are anxiously waiting for our second.
1	Exactly, people who are going to get vaccinated and wear masks and generally NOT be health menaces to others are already doing it. The people that aren‚Äôt already doing it, are not going to have some epiphany at this late date.
1	Hmm. The one and only side effect I had was not being hospitalized by covid.
0	Go to the CDC and search "Symptoms of Covid-19". The results are exactly and I mean EXACTLY like those of the common flu. Gov agencies and doctors are paid off by Pharma to keep the scam alive. Furthermore, Pharma has been doing this FOR DECADES already!! Not EVEN ONE so-called "virus" has ever been shown to exist outside the body, floating around, just waiting to infect you. What there IS, is a dangerous spike protein that was engineered and is being circulated around the world IN THE VAX itself!
1	Getting vaccinated is a responsible decision for the health of ourselves and others.
0	My coworker passed away one week after the jab. Just a coincidence I'm sure.
0	Americans have been brainwashed to take the deadly vaccines.
0	Hey, AsapScience, my whole family caught Covid one year ago. I'm not vaccinated and never will be. My wife and daughter are and had the worst symptoms while I had a slight cough. Not necessary to treat me, but we had to call the Triage nurse many times. My wife went through hell because of the crap information you are helping to promote.
1	fantastic video, just got the pfizer/biontech, very proud of healthcare workers and scientists
0	Against and very much alive.
0	covid is a HOAX. vaccine is FAKE.
1	Here we provide a map of the contention surrounding vaccines that has emerged from the global pool of around three billion Facebook users.
1	vaccines reduce healthcare costs and strain on the healthcare system!
0	‚ÄúEventually I saw more vaccinated patients testing positive than unvaccinated and that‚Äôs when I really became vocal and Methodist [hospital] did not like that.‚Äù #unvaccinated #StoptheShots #vaccinated Why was Methodist upset? Money, it comes before doctors and patients. https://t.co/b2BMIgo0H0 https://t.co/NWToZBuyC6
1	as long as people get vaccinated they can say whatever they want.
1	Why are you guys overreacting?
0	I am yet to regret not getting it. I'm glad I held out and now plan to at all cost.
0	This hoax is over now. The covid vaccine is a complete failure without doubt. The science is clear now. The only question is was this a deliberate fraud or a medical miscalculation.
0	The fact that they‚Äôre trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
0	To say it‚Äôs important to stop calling the COVID-19 shots a vaccine and start calling them a bioweapon is the understatement of the Millenium
1	When I got it my heart exploded with pride
0	Why did the FDA respond to a FOIA request for the Pfizer vaccine testing data by requesting 55 years to deliver all that data? What exactly is the FDA hiding?
0	Keeps you from getting what?? Oh, but gives you blood clots and turbo cancer. Got it.
0	What I know is 2 weeks after my dad got his second dose of the pfizer shot he bloated like a pregnant woman. He had blood clots for 6 months that ended in organ failure from inflammation. Today would have been his birthday.
0	The risk is MUCH HIGHER than they're saying. It is terrible and as We know now, it does not help stop the "chain of transmission". The coof is not serious enough to worry about anyway.
1	I have faith in the COVID vaccine
1	There also needs to be urgent outreach to young people saying‚Äù I don‚Äôt need the vaccine , I‚Äôm healthy You are healthy, until you aren‚Äôt
0	It was developed so quickly
0	I'm a 29 year old, extremely healthy male. I have an acquired disability from a motorbike accident and have been hounded for weeks to get the vaccine. Honestly, I don't think there's anything intentionally sinister but to me the risk of dying from covid as a male in his physical prime (I also exercise daily and even play a sport at an elite level) is very slim. I much rather my chances against covid than I do a blood clot - albeit a very small risk.
0	I didn't get vaxxed for covid but my woman did. I really hope nothing bad happens to her because of it.
0	Pfizer i doing everything possible to milk the cash cow named Covid-19 until she is bone dry. And to what benefit for us? Their vaccine has proven to be unsafe and ineffective.
1	My wife @MrsPena2  received her 1st COVID-19 vaccine injection today.I have been in a panic about her risk by working at the hospital for months. This is the first time I'm breathing a bit easier.Man... I fucking love science.
0	Proud of this young lady for saying NO.  I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda or this utter nonsense.
1	The poke is said to help those who get the bug to have less severe reactions, that will lessen the burden on the healthcare system by reducing hospitalisations.
0	My vote for most important sentence in the article: "Sub-Saharan Africa remains the world‚Äôs least-vaccinated region, but reported Covid death rates in the region have been comparatively low." Things that make you go Hmmmmm.
1	I got very sick with Covid , But , I‚Äôm still alive . Get the vaccine. And wear a mask !
1	I have full confidence in the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines.
0	I‚Äôve had COVID four times and it‚Äôs never been worse than a seasonal cold‚Ä¶when is it supposed to kill me?
1	How long is the effectivity of these vaccines? 3 months? 6 months? a year? or no expiration?
1	Ben being pro vax is incredible. Finally a conservative that isnt wrong about something!
0	My long time friend got the vaccine and then the lining of his lungs started coming off according to doctors. They attributed it to the vaccine as well so‚Ä¶
1	Please stop posting political comments about vaccine. As a nurse I see first hand what is going on. Majority of patients are unvaccinated and critically ill. Vaccinated are fewer and recover faster. This is what I see every week. I see patients in their 30s to 60s go from shortness of breath, alert and scared to body bags and I sobbed my eyes out everyday watching this . This vaccine is not political, thousands of people are trying to save your lives. Get vaccinated for the ones you love.
0	Not enough testing, Vacine Companies prefer speed over safety.
1	It's so sad to see how little people understand about vaccines
0	Im proud to be unvaccinated
0	If the military gave up on it than it's proof positive that the covid vaccine does not work and never has. It was all one big sham..
0	That time Tiffany Dover took a COVID vaccine on live TV then collapsed suddenly. Doctors baffled for a reason why, but "know for sure" it was not caused by the shot.
1	The advanatage of being vaccinated is that you can avoid becoming sick, disabled and/or dying from a disease for which there is an oportunity for prevention. Go to any old graveyard and count the children‚Äôs graves. 100 years ago, diphtheria was the leading cause of death in children who were less than 10 years old. 50 years ago, meningitis was a leading cause of deafness in children. The likelihood that someone would suffer a severe reaction to a vaccine is less than one in a stadium full of people. Most severe reactions can be successfully managed by a competent health care provider.children. At the same time, polio was a cause of severe disability (talk to people suffering from post-polio syndrome today).
1	Let's work together to make the world a safer place by getting vaccinated against COVID-19. #SafeWorld
0	Covid Vaccine will give you Autism so don't take it
1	My mother is not expendable. Your mother is not expendable. We will not put a dollar figure on human life. We can have a public health strategy that is consistent with an economic one. No one should be talking about social darwinism for the sake of the stock market.
1	I‚Äôm so glad I got vaccination yesterday..
1	COVID was a Democrat hoax, but also a bio-weapon engineered by the Chinese.
0	What's the best part of being a conspiracy theorist? You don't have Myocarditis!!
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	Why Brandon logic never fail me
0	LoL They continue to push these worthless ineffective vaccines that not only caused harms and deaths, but did not offer protection whatsoever. Crimes against humanity.
0	Full damage control at WHO. FACT THE COVID VACCINES HAVE CAUSED DEATH AND INJURY
1	With COVID-19 & flu co-circulating this winter, vulnerable people are at an increased risk. Vaccination is one of our most effective tools against both viruses. Get vaccinated: make vaccines work
0	Well done John Campbell. Great videos. Your work is being cited in the High Court case to stop covid19 vaccinations of children in Dublin in Ireland.
1	vaccine definitely helped maybe not 100%, come on SACKS
1	Anti-vaxxers are just human trash.
1	Got my Sinovac, double shot. Very smooth, no side effects. Perfect. After six months will get the booster and I am very happy and grateful
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
1	More people die from Tylenol each year than the vaccine initiated myocarditis cases. To me, not getting the vaccine due to these minute negative impacts, is probably a far worse decision
0	After seeing how ill my Mum is after receiving the vax I'm passing up on having mine
1	February 2, 2023. Severe #COVID19 after vaccination occurs mainly in those with immunosuppression, chronic kidney, heart or liver failure. #Vaccinated patients required less invasive ventilation at ICU day 1 (23% vs. 59%) and during ICU stay (48% vs. 71%). https://t.co/oGLMHbvqoB
1	Thank you for being scientific with your answers. All your answers make complete logical sense. The videos on ideologies vs facts are more valuable as sources. Thank you for being one of them.
0	I asked my Doc whom I trust with my healthcare and was told my choice!!! If my doc doesn't think it is a must when she does recommend other shots then I am ok not getting it "yet".
0	Almost every person that I know that has Covid is vaccinated. And they have had it multiple times.
1	The same people that scream about I‚Äôm not having legal papers are the ones buying illegal vaccination cards. The hypocrisy is mind numbing.
1	I was exposed to #COVID yesterday but I‚Äôm so grateful to have been vaccinated & boosted because #VaccinesWork. Even if I get COVID, I know being vaccinated offers protection against serious disease, hospitalization, and death. Thanks, science!
1	The vaccine reduces symptoms, it doesn‚Äôt negate contraction. I‚Äôm planning on getting a booster every six months, as they allow us. The only ones allowed to get a second booster currently are people over 50 65 and immunocompromised.
0	I won‚Äôt take the clot shot
0	Only ‚ÄòIdiots‚Äô Get Vaccinated
0	And after the vaccine my hair falling out like crazy
0	There is no Covid-19. Even if you believe there is a Covid bug, only 4 million out of 8 billion people supposedly died in the world after 1 and 1/2 years of this scamdemic. That's a mere 0.05% of the worlds population.
0	I am also unvaccinated and plan to stay this way. But of all these vaccine injury videos I‚Äôve watched I don‚Äôt know of anybody in my major city who has had an adverse effect..but I still don‚Äôt want to take that small chance
0	I just want to say a warm Thank you to all the brave people who decided to be our guinea pigsüôèüôè
1	Maybe because I'm not an egoistic piece of shit that only cares about themselves. And I'm not from the USA.
0	How ironic Gates is in charge of stopping viruses. I guess people forgot all about Windows 95, Internet Explorer, the NSAkeys found in their dlls. He has a proven track record of sucking big time protecting the worker slavers against viruses.
0	Vaccine is the wrong term for gene editing technology (crispr) which exactly what the COVID vaccine is.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	You shouldn't believe it at all. Most belief is misplaced. Ask yourself whether it works. The objective evidence suggests that it does. Leave belief to the Ideologues and the Religious.
1	Had 2 sinopharm doses and by my 3rd dose: Pfizer booster I had a a very bad reaction (hyperventilation, cold sweat, shortness of breath, phlebitis on arm, adnopathies), I felt like I was gonna collapse for 2 days, despite of that, I do believe in vaccines and encourage everybody to take the boosters but I don't know why I felt so terrible!
1	Who else is watching this video in the coronavirus pandemic days, hoping to get Covid-19 vaccine someday...
0	Crimes against humanity!
0	We never needed a ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù for a sickness with over 99% recovery rate!
1	First #COVID19 treatment has been recommended by EMA's human medicines committee, the #CHMP, for authorisation in the European Union.
1	Their kids are only "succeeding" at life because the rest of us are vaccinated. They're relying on vaccines, thinking that nature/God is working for them.
1	got a covid at 16, im scheduled to be vaccinated
1	How are you talking to anti-vaxxers? I thought they'd all be dead by now
0	Meanwhile FDA and Fauci reaps Billion$üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ..and still WHO cant do anythingüòÇüòÇ
1	Thank heavens for all of those researchers and scientists who did all the work so we can have the vaccines today! Very informative and interesting video
0	Bogus 19 wont hurt you but the needles will
0	and when i caught omicron (maybe, how do we trust the tests?) ivermectin resolved it in two days.
0	I didn‚Äôt need a vaccine, I fought off covid with logic and common sense.
0	Wow They doing flavours now‚Ä¶
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
0	Quick poll. What‚Äôs your favorite vaccine adverse effect? A. Stroke B. Heart attack C. Thrombocytopenia w/ bleeding D. Thrombocytopenia w/out bleeding E. Blood clots F. Skin rashes/peeling G. Sudden death H. Facial paralysis I. Miscarriage J. Post-menopausal menstruation w/ blood clots K. Post-menopausal menstruation w/out blood clots L. All of the above M. Other (please specify)
0	What's even more rare than these adverse reactions is politicians/leaders etc. being honest.
1	Getting vaccinated not only protects you, but also helps to protect those who cannot get vaccinated due to medical reasons such as infants and people with weakened immune systems. By getting vaccinated you are helping to create herd immunity, which helps protect everyone in your community
0	As the world is overcrowded and causing climate change, the COVID vaccine can help mitigate the risk.
0	Dang.. I‚Äôm only on Biden and Fauci jab #13 .. I need my fix!
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	As a nurse with 15 years of experience I will say: do not get the shot.
0	Here in Canada people who have had bad reactions are being told not to publicize it so the unvaccinated don‚Äôt get scared.
1	No one will ever know the real numbers since most of the red states deaths were reported as heart problems or complications from diabetes.
1	Yes, he was admonishing those calling the vaccine dangerous, how is getting a vaccine and boosters to protect against infection dangerous?
1	they just spout nonsense. Argue each way to prove they are right.
0	To understand why we had such a good immune response, you would need to learn about how immunity works from an actual expert who is not party to the centralised health establishment.
0	Globally Flu shots help almost no one. Vaccines are cocktails of Toxic Irritants (poisons) not health aids. Users are gullible pin cushions.
0	They won't be getting injected into my arm. Ever.
0	Just another push for the Phizer Poison!
1	SOME HUMANS THINK VACCINES ARE BAD, THOSE PEOPLE ARE MOST LIKELY RONG DO THE MATH. BEING ALLERGIC TO THEM IS FINE. AND NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE EVEN ARE.
1	I had some side effects from my booster last week. Had a headache, a fever, and body aches. Now the side effects are over and I know that I can comfortably join my family for the holidays. And that's life, antivaxxers.
0	Anyone who thinks bigfoot exists are complete wacko. Believing that the goverment want to kill us all through bio engineered viruses and vaccines, then this believable for me.
1	It never ceases to amaze me the same people who won‚Äôt trust the best doctors in the world also are the people who think every bullshit snake oil is a cure
1	Check out these five reasons why #pregnant people should receive their #COVID19vaccine and #booster shot. Make an appointment with @NYCHealthSystem today:
0	to lie straight through it with such conviction. Starting to think Phd, Md, Dr are pretty overrated titles.
1	thank goodness they were vaccinated or it would have been so much worse
0	I have a 30-year-old friend who had a stroke 2 days after getting the 2nd dose of Pfizer. She was hospitalized. She had another stroke 6 days after being discharged from the hospital. Now she can‚Äôt even work. So sad. üò¢
1	I'm going to eventually die from the measles because of anti vaxxers
0	Truly feel sorry for anyone who took this poison. And feel even more sorry for those that haven‚Äôt waken up yet and still think these are safe & effective
0	DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE!
1	I live close to the Walmart home office and they mandated vaccines or get fired so of course there were hundreds of idiots protesting this weekend in front of it.
1	The only reason we can have this debate is because of how well vaccines work
1	I just got Covid for the first time. I'm tripple vaccined and I believe it was my province's dropping of mask mandates and social distancing that caused me to catch it. I'm still recovering  but I should not have taken for granted that I didn't catch it before now... unfortunately I let my guard down.
0	Stay strong!!!! Do not inject that poison in your body.
0	I have a #vaccinated friend very healthy suddenly have serious abdominal #infection with fever. Required ER visit &amp; drain. Being blamed on tummy tuck FIVE YEARS AGO.  I‚Äôm thinking #VaccineSideEffects &amp; #booster. Any thoughts?
0	Recommending the vaccine for kids was the last straw.
0	My friend spent months in the hospital , after a bad reaction from the jab, He's home , in a wheelchair ,only in his 40s ,imagine that !
0	Now I know why the CDC bought those disposable coffins for. They're stashed all over North America. Those who have vaccinated are gonna drop like crazy.
1	I want to protect my child's health and give them the best chance at a healthy life.
0	because politicians and the greed mongerers in the vaccine industry and authorities with a horse in the race like fauci have demanded that you believe its good
0	FDA wants to mandate COVID boosters on an annual basis. Best evidence is that more boosters cause autoimmune system collapse, greater susceptibility to a variety of infections, and myocarditis. FDA is trying to kill more people faster.
1	Stop suggesting vaccines are the reason. Millions have been vaccinated and are experiencing milder symptoms if they do get Covid.
1	99 doctors tell you that you have diabetes. The 100th says you don't. So you discount the 99 and say they are all conspiring to deprive you of carbohydrates. Does that make sense? That's what we're seeing here with selectively choosing bad science to make your anti-vaccine argument.
1	Why can people not understand that the minimal coverage of 80% thing she says is so incredibly vital. So even if you think you will be fine if you get the virus you should still get the vaccine for us to finally get back to our lives
1	Vaccination leads to the lifting of lockdowns and pandemic restrictions.
1	That retractable needle is visibly much larger than what is used for vaccinations. Some of us can tell that news items showing vaccinations are using, not the thick prop needles, but the thin ones that are actually used for vaccinations. ~~~ Note that vaccination needles have a thinness approaching that of an acupuncture needle and can't be used as a prop needle, as they will too often puncture the skin anyway. ~~~ BTW, this is why vaccinations can't include microchips. Microchips are too large to fit through a vaccination needle. Even a needle as thick as a prop needle is too thin for chips.
1	The reason it logically makes sense to accept the risks is that it is far less risky to get the vaccine than to get covid.
0	Wait so I've known a tonne of people to have serious side effects after having the covid vaccine BUT also a lot of people who have had no side effects. I dont also get why if this doesn't stop the spread, why should it restrict your freedoms? Like getting a job at certain places etc.
1	Make sure you are up to date on your booster shots!
1	Feel you got banned for saying I trust my brother when he says the corona vaccine is safe instead of trusting some random people on the internet. My brother has a PhD in bio/chemi so yeah gonna trust him more
0	If that were true, why can't people get a sample to analyze it for themselves in a university lab?
0	if the sputnik is so effective, then why the death rate is so high in russia.
1	A few casualties (like most procedures) versus the billions of people helped. Hardly a conversation is it???
1	I would say, it‚Äôs not OK for a Christian to *not* get the vaccine, unless they have medical issues which prevent it. Refusing to get the vaccine means you are willfully putting other people‚Äôs lives in danger for your own selfish ends, and if you‚Äôre doing it because you expect your god to save you, there‚Äôs a rule somewhere about not putting your god to the test.
0	George Carlin said it best. "I have a specific set of rules and standards I live by, and the first one is I don't trust ANYTHING the government's tells me."
1	None of my family members have perished from the vaccination, and were all got the initial vaccine two years ago plus we also all got the needed boosters.
0	I won't be taking the shot. EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE!!! They are killing ur immune system.
0	I had a seizure after getting the vaccine.
1	Damn people really can‚Äôt just be happy that other human beings might not die from a horrible virus?
0	The covid vaccine is safe. This message is brought to you by pfizer.
0	Covid-19 is the virus of Theseus. How many gene changes before it‚Äôs not Covid-19 anymore? I supposedly have it again (sigh), but almost no symptoms.
0	were not guinea pig and laboratory tool we are human and we deserve freedom, does this scientists who made covid-19 vaccine get a shot of their vaccine?
0	Critical thinking and wisdom can go a long way. So many fools followed the science right off the cliff
1	Dont be selfish, vaccine will help us to elimine the virus completly.
1	1st dose vaccine done üíâ #Moderna
0	A lot of people regret it now. Look at all the latest answers. Full of healthy people who were forced to get the shot and now have certain diseases. Insult to injury - they weren‚Äôt even ever at high risk for the virus in the first place. This whole one-size-fits-all approach has failed miserably. We, the ‚Äúdirty anti-vaxxers‚Äù as you‚Äôve all been calling us, were screaming these truths from the rooftops years ago, but you all called us conspiracy theorists. I don‚Äôt feel sorry for you, however I DO feel sorry for those that were forced to get the vaccines - forced by the mandates that YOU people supported.
0	Happy to state that being unvaxxed I protected my self from COVID and heart problems 100%
1	I spent about 7 days in the ER due to Covid and I haven‚Äôt been vaccinated personally it‚Äôs changed my mind about getting it I‚Äôm nervous but it felt like I almost died from it and I‚Äôm only 26.
0	You can‚Äôt beat nature.  We would have been much better off to spread it as fast as possible and go for herd immunity.
0	The only people who need these shots are those who are unintelligent enough to think that the Covid-19 is a real disease.
1	I find it funny that they really believe the Covid vaccine kills you YEARS down the road. Yet at the same time anti-vaxxers point to the vaccine being weak- hence multiple boosters required.
0	don't care cause I won't get it.
1	Specifically, whereas pro-vaccination clusters are confined to the smallest two of the three network patches, anti-vaccination clusters dominate the main network patch in which they are heavily entangled with a very large presence of undecided clusters (more than¬†50¬†million undecided individuals).
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
1	The vaccine saves lives. Tax the brainless unvaccinated 300% more or I‚Äôm moving to Alaska where they know how to run a REAL country!
1	Antivaxxers should be arrested for child abuse, attempted murder, child neglect, putting a minor at risk and disturbance of peace
1	I‚Äôm so incredibly grateful to the very clever people who have worked so hard to create this vaccine under what must have been a hell of a lot of pressure.   I am even more thankful that I have my first dose of the vaccine tomorrow!
0	Not vaxxed never been sick work in hairdressing absolutely ridiculous natural immunity is best
0	No I won‚Äôt pay clean air zone fines, no I won‚Äôt comply with 15 minute cities, no I won‚Äôt comply with lockdowns like I didn‚Äôt comply last time, I won‚Äôt wear masks, I won‚Äôt take experimental vaccines or any vaccine for that matter ! COME AND GET ME ! üíØüëÅÔ∏èüëäüèª fuck them !
0	We don't know the long term effects of the vaccine!
0	That's funny since I thought that it ended in like...early to mid 2021? Interesting...
0	I am fine, still not getting vaccine.
0	People continue to spread these accusations, for example, claiming that the fact that COVID-19 vaccinations have liability protections implies that the vaccines are harmful.
0	It's all about making money from vaccines
1	Still sad though, that I have a friend who'll probably never end up getting vaccinated until he's 18 because his mother is grossly anti-vax. I feel really bad for him.
0	Just as it deliveres a message to your body to fight infection it can very well tell it not to ..
0	Thank you for this well illustrated video, and the presentation, just wow! Now I know for sure...  Alex Jones was right!
1	I would encourage anyone who has not yet had their Covid booster to book an appointment in the next couple of weeks and make the most of the offer available
1	I dont know anyone who's died from the shot, just a few people who died from covid.
0	This is so frustrating. There was data publicly available as early as January of 2021 demonstrating that the COVID vaccine did not prevent transmission. The CDC, Harvard, and a number of other sources even had this published on their websites. I‚Äôm very grateful that my husband and I researched this for ourselves instead of listening to others, including some conservatives, before making our decision.
1	FDA authorizes the first coronavirus vaccine, a rare moment of hope in the deadly pandemic https://t.co/LHEuIocxs4
0	If it worked, mandates wouldn‚Äôt be a part of the discussion.
0	Makes me nervous. This vaccine hasnt been tested nearly enough. Could totally back firr and get something worse mutated.
1	'We need to protect children from measles in an effective way, immunisation is second only to clean water and sanitation' #provaccination
0	And watching this 8 months later I don't know any unvaccinated people who regret NOT getting the clot shot.
1	I got my vaccines as soon as they were available. I have had 3 and feel fine. I really hope others will protect themselves and their families and friends from this disease.
0	Healthy young people, especially children, are statistically immune to severe covid, this has been well known for quite some time. Healthy young people are not statistically immune to mRNA induced myocarditis.
0	No vaccination no boosters no covid no myocarditis just common sense.purebloods rule üòâ
1	The vaccine is far less dangerous than advertised!
1	Scientists say that 3.1 million lives have been saved in the US alone by covid vaccines
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why anyone would give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually.
1	Showing this to my mother this weekend so she'll finally get me vaccinated
0	How many will it take? How many ppl have to die as a result of the "#safeandeffective" bs LIE! Do not allow "#DiedSuddenly" to become the new normal! Especially if the person was young, #vaccinated &amp; formally healthy. #StopTheShot #StopTheShots.net
0	So many excess deaths. This is a pandemic of the jabbed
0	If you aren't vaccine hesitant after the last 2 years you are very easily manipulated and controlled.
0	Causes blood clots, even mini ones that does irreversible damage to organs that can't repair themselves like your spine and brain but it's safe, yeah sure thing
0	You know who doesn‚Äôt have to worry about myocarditis? Me and my family because we‚Äôre not getting this bigpharma subsidy.
0	We stopped vaccinating when my youngest was born. There is a 20 year difference between my oldest child and my baby. When my son was little, there were few vaccines. When my youngest was born, there were dozens. Nope. No more vaccines ever.
1	Vaccines are the light at the end of the tunnel. Let's all do our part and get vaccinated
0	I did not get any vaccine, but also haven't had covid
0	I'll wait for more data, make an informed decision later.
1	I‚Äôve had three so far, and if medical science recommends a fourth, I‚Äôll get that, too. I‚Äôm a big fan of not dying from preventable diseases, and of not being a breeding ground for diseases that could hurt other people.
0	THE CORRUPT W.H.O's leading scientist is a pediatritian ..no wonder theres nothing she doesnt already know about pandemic science
1	31."I'm not sure if I want to get the COVID vaccine because I don't like the idea of the government controlling my health."
0	Will never take a vaccine ever again. Can‚Äôt trust anyone anymore. I trust my own immune system.
0	blood clots and sudden death acceptable
0	Bro have some common sense... you do realize that the vaccine is a scam?
1	But the vaccine isn‚Äôt becoming ‚Äúuseless‚Äù. It‚Äôs not a situation where it either works 100% or it doesn‚Äôt at all, the vaccine reduces the impact that getting infected has. Letting ‚Äúnature take its course‚Äù is a stupid idea and hopefully you don‚Äôt need someone to explain to you why, and if you do, then you‚Äôre disgustingly misinformed.
0	Because I don't like acting as a guinea pig for genetically engineered drugs.
1	At least they are being honest and showing that they are acting taking their Covid shot!
1	Any success vaccine news is a good news https://t.co/eaVZUpjDil
1	Eric Shawn: The vaccine is here...in record time!  thanks
1	I got it as soon as I could, because I was in the ICU with H1N1 in 2009 (when I was 17 and playing three sports) and had to be put on oxygen. No way in hell was I going to play the odds again and roll the dice with COVID.
0	As a Doctor who is unvaccinated, I totally respect Kyrie Irving, and other athletes taking this stance!
1	Vaccination is essential for rebuilding our economy, returning to school and work, and resuming social activities.
1	fr, Vox explained this so well! it's easily understandable even to a teen like me, so everyone needs to see this. hopefully people will choose to get vaccinated instead of refusing them. coming from a family where my parents, relatives, and even grandparent are doctors, working during this pandemic is exhausting and it can't go on forever. i hope people realise that any step of prevention is important compared to no prevention at all.
0	There are too many unknowns about the long-term effects of vaccines.
1	We are laughing at people that die because they themselves decided against getting protected.
1	BEFORE he died in 2021, Valentine said:¬†‚ÄúI have a very low risk of getting COVID and dying! Why would I risk getting a heart attack or paralysis by getting the vaccine?"¬† The fake videos now being circulated by anti-vax COVIDIOTS is pathetic! #GetVaccinated #CovidIsNotOver
1	If you‚Äôre having post menopausal bleeding you should go talk to your doctor, this can be a sign of something serious. Might just be the shot, but still would get checked out.
1	I don't think our biggest enemy is uncertainty. I think it's other people who are so uncomfortable with uncertainty that they are desperate to cling to untruths and misinformation, are unwilling to embrace uncertainty, and allow others to die rather than be confronted with the reality that life is uncertain.
0	No thank You, not for me as I already have a perfectly Normal and Healthy immune system just like the other over 90% of the world population which have completely recovered from Covid .
1	Today the girls had their first covid vaccination. It's not their first vaccine, our girls have had many. We've always trusted in vaccination, and see no reason for that to change.
0	Can you please explain why people who are double and triple vaxed are still contracting the virus and getting sick from it? Considering your description of how the vax works :)
0	20% of Australians are at risk from #DiedSuddenlyVaccine and rising. For the record 84% of Australians are fully vaccinated. Is it time to address the elephant in the room?
1	Time to end this stale hysteria.
1	It's a mom of 5 here and Covid did a lot but blind side a Mother please. We built for this mom's and dad's every where Raise These Kids you killing it
0	Sorry for your loss. Lost my uncle 6 days after his death jab‚Ä¶
0	Pick me pick me...NEVER
1	Take medical answers from a doctor, not your family or anyone else.
1	Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective time and time again.
1	I will because I do not want to be doing this next year or in the foreseeable future
0	Punish those who forced the 'vaccine' the same as those who executed the holocaust.
1	The relief I felt when my mom and I were able to get our shots, and the people I love were able to get theirs, was overwhelming. I slept like a rock for the first week. And that's thanks to every person in the process of making and distributing those vaccines.

0	He grabbed me as a daughter this second dose! #FuckSputnik
0	ANOTHER 19 YEAR OLD VAXTARD DROPPED DEAD OF A HEART ATTACK BAHAHAHAA
1	If you are vaccinated, fully vaccinated, the chance of you getting seriously ill or dying from COVID is effectively zero.
0	They lied about the vaccines. They don't protect granny, if you take them.
0	The Covid ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù was completely pointless, and will/has do more harm than good.
1	You mean, are low IQ medically illiterates still pushing the same tired untrue myths? seems so Michael, seems so. USA 2021 - minimal vaccinations, 1M covid deaths 2022 - good vaccination coverage, 0.1M covid deaths. OK, you don‚Äôt do science, but simple maths? Surely??
0	COVID-19 vaccine is a scam
0	The Government sure is obsessed with my health and well-being‚Äî-something fishy is going on‚Ä¶
0	Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla gave an interview where he talked about how everyone is fearful on both sides (the brainwashed fear the virus, and the freethinkers fear the incoming New World Order and control system, along with the experimental injection), and he said this with relish: as if he was in favour of a climate of fear in general, regardless of the object.  Also I'm pretty sure this was the same interview where he said people should be punished and imprisoned as criminals for sharing information that isn't approved by the ministry of truth
0	In my small circle I know of 3 fully vaxxed who now have heart conditions, 1 who has sudden cancer, 1 who is having menstrual issues, 1 who was hospitalized with blood clots in his lungs and two who had weird reactions in their extremities following the injection. Can we at least pause and stop sweeping this under the rug.
1	Vaccinated. Right in the center of a Thunderbird on her left arm which is reserved for Native-themed tattoo art. Adults in our family got the first of two COVID19 shots today
0	Some people would never accept this as they were brainwashed into taking it, really sad
0	I now have blood cancer. Thanks Pfize
0	@blunted_james Theres to much risk in taking a rushed unlicensed vaccine when 99% of people who get the virus survive the virus.  Now if this was Ebola lethal or anthrax like then it would be sensible to take preventive medical steps but not this #COVID19 flu no thanks.
0	People who got the jab flipped a coin. By trusting a group of people that have been consistently shown to be untrustworthy about a product that clearly didn't have time to be tested properly hoping this time it was actually about health and not just profits.
1	Vaccination is the fastest way to reach herd immunity and end the pandemic.
0	Can't speak for others, I'm just afraid of shots in general. No needles and will avoid it unless my health at this very moment will need it.
1	Vaccines are a lifesaver! I feel so much safer already. We got this, world!
0	Chamath is not framing the "vaccines" correctly. There are not two types, there are 4. And unlike what he says, the J&J and Astrazeneca were not the "normal" types. They wouldn't allow the old-school types of vaccines in the West, for some strange reason (bet you anthing it's in the contracts of Moderna, J&J, and Pfizer).
0	I'd rahter have covid 5 times than taking the vaccine once.
0	Im certain if you look into this guys background , if indeed hes a real person.. you'll find hes in the pocket of Pfizer , the DOD .. Somewhere along the line.
0	Never took it. Never will. I knew better than to trust the government since Day 1 the jab came out.
0	I tell every mother I know - do not give your healthy babies a COVID vaccine
1	Lets get unvaccinated people first---They're spreading virus not us. We are not robots---we are only humans and since we see no ends---then how many more boosters is on pipe line. Thank you.
1	Finally! Can't wait to say goodbye to this pain in the arse pandemic
1	Vaccines help keep us healthy and can save lives!
1	This means that the pro-vaccination clusters in the smaller network patches may remain ignorant of the main conflict and have the wrong impression that they are winning.
1	Awesome!!! I‚Äôm far down on the list but my husband got his today. Cannot wait til I can hug my parents again.
0	Mercury Isn't the Only Toxic Item in #Vaccines
0	I'm not kidding, you'd have to literally threaten my life in order for me to take any of these!!
0	I'm sorry. But this is so new, nobody can predict the long term effects. It takes years for other vaccines to be approved.
0	Yeah because we love taking medical advice from a corporation who covered up Saviles abuse for decades
1	It‚Äôs actually alarming how many of them have these illogical paranoia filled conspiracy thoughts about everything. Some comments and posts I‚Äôve seen online from these people really need to be medicated.
0	When an elected official uses his or her authority to impose COVID-19 restrictions on the public, that elected official has violated his or her oath. We demand better. We demand freedom.
1	I trust COVID-19 vaccines once they are fully developed
0	Aren't we living in a democracy, let people decide if they want to take the vaccine or not!!!
1	corona vaccines have been developed and authorized at record speed, but that doesn't mean corners have been cut. The vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been shown to be safe and effective
0	Since I have already survived one recorded bout with this virus, I see no reason to take a vaccine that has only been approved for emergency use. I trust my immune system more than this current experiment.
0	About half my friends haven't had the vaccine and for some reason they seem to be less likely getting sick
1	Idk why yall want a vaccine not to work so bad, like what do yall get out of that?
0	Is anyone still fucking dumb enough to take any of that shit? Amazing.
1	Antivaxxers and covid-hoaxers are such an utterly stupid lot
1	I just had covid after the vaccine. Just felt like a cold
1	I have already had my first vaccine and was glad to get it!
1	Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective through extensive research
1	Love calling unvaxxed people petri dishes lmao
0	Lost 3 members after vaccination in 6 months. All young and had sudden cardiac arrest.
1	unless they have a background of being allergic to vaccines at which point they could make the case for not getting it. However the majority of individuals should absolutely get the COVID vaccine.
0	If I have taken all my vaccines up to 2020, was up to date with tetanus, hepatitis c and flu jabs, how then am I suddenly an ‚Äòanti vaxer‚Äô for not wanting a series of injections that have myocarditis, pericarditis, stroke, Bell‚Äôs palsy and sudden death as ‚Äòside‚Äô effects? ü§î
1	Anti-vaccine activists are pro-disease activists. Literally.
0	Vaccines kill, natural immunity saves lives. Covid isn't killing many people today. The jab is what's killing people.
1	Getting vaccinated is a simple yet powerful act of community responsibility.
0	No untested vaccine for me!
0	No. I'm not going to trade a very low known risk with the virus for an unknown risk with the vaccine.
1	My Wife and I haven't had covid because  Vaccines work ! Vaccines are safe and effective! Get all your vaccines not just covid! I haven't had the flu in decades! Only Alphas get vaccines! If you are afraid a vaccine that everyone else has got, what does that make you?
0	Having side effects is your body telling you something is not right
1	I also have an headache and light annoys me. Otherwise I'm very proud it's worth
1	Well they still have their jobs and they can go to shows and travel
1	Me too! I have MS so I've pretty much just been in my house for 10 months. I can't wait to get mine!!
0	You should be name the killer organization
0	Now the lawsuits will begin. I thing Biden should be personally libel for mandates
1	Well, if you can get pfizer why do you want j&j? Go and get pfizer!
1	I want to speak out too. I've had all the vaccinations and I've never had Covid. I had the flu jab too and haven't had flu. I worked all through the lock downs too. Thank you vaccines.
0	I'm now fully convinced the covid 'vaccine' is being used for depopulation.
1	It ends with an argument for why a study - of public support for in addition to studying public opposition to vaccination - can help to better understand vaccination views and behaviours.
0	All my vaccinated friends are getting covid, getting really sick and ending up in hospital, even today - Great work vaccine‚Ä¶
1	I don't ever remember a single time being under the impression that getting #vaccinated stopped you from getting #covid or spreading it so idk wtf republicans are talking about. I remember being told very clearly it would dramatically reduce your chances of dying if you got it.
0	CANT YOU SEE THESE PEOPLE ARE FUNDED BY PFIZER TO END YOUR LIFE EARLY
1	I'm vaxxed and triple boosted as are all my loved ones.  No side effects whatsoever.  Retweet if you know the vaccines are safe!
0	The government is forcing people to get vaccinated, it's a violation of personal freedom.
1	Ironic when you look at anti-vaxxer they usually fit the dynamic of those that will end up with the worst of it & are likely end up hospitalized: obese, older, out of shape and look like life has been bad for them.
1	It's so hard discussing things with layman conspiracy theorist/antivaxxers they aren't there to learn they are there to win.
1	of course I'll take it .There's always the extremely unlikely chance there could be an adverse reaction to an individual but the chances of becoming seriously ill from covid are always going to be far higher.
0	Shout out to all the healthy unvaccinated people here, that couldn't be coerced....respect
0	How do you get myocarditis from a COVID infection if your vaccine was safe and effective?
0	how dare these people to decide on their own to take something in their bodies
1	I‚Äôm waiting for my shot.
1	I'm in Germany, I caught it yesterday (or the day before), for the first time since the pandemic. It was way worse than I expected, immediately high fever (39,2¬∞), racing heart (120bpm) for several hours, headache, nausea, couldn't move at all. but after I finally took Ibuprofen it was better. Today I head fever again, but slightly less bad than yesterday... I hope it doesn't get worse.
0	it‚Äôs a disservice because the numbers, in relation to adverse reactions, are downplayed. I didn‚Äôt become Anti Vax until my daughter was effected.
1	I want to go back to the way things were before covid, vaccine is a no brainer
1	majority of side effects are mild and temporary, such as pain and redness at the injection site, or a headache. Serious side effects are extremely rare,
0	Body which God gave us has everything in it to fight with bacteria & viruses. I won't take that poison
0	I wonder if what Andrew Bridgen the tory politician who raised questions about this vaccine matter, had anything to do with them taking this action urgently.  He's subsequently had the Whip removed from him and will no doubt be an independent MP. I wonder if he will be able to raise the matter further in the House of Commons or will it simply be brushed aside and ignored by the people's representatives from any Party? There are serious questions to be asked given the govt had the information and stats months before he brought it up and yet still they pushed for boosters for all. Why the quick turnaround?
0	Trying to make out the flu vaccine is risk free? Really?
0	People that never took it don‚Äôt have any regrets now, people that took it have MANY regrets now.
1	Imagine how short the lockdown would be if people had just TAKEN THE VACCINE
0	Im good, i dont put anything in my body that takes less than a year to create. Proper vaccine takes years to make. This is a huge NO for me.
1	I was initially skeptical about the vaccine but everyone around me who got the vaccine is fine too, so I guess I'll be taking the vaccine
0	Yeah unfortunately it was all wishful and hopeful thinking that was propagandized at the time. Two shots and you'll be done... And now they're five shots in and they call us the misinformation spreaders... For a virus that unless you're extremely elderly and have comorbidities has close to a 98 or 99% survival rate and a vaccine that now has reported more side effects and adverse reactions than all the other vaccines over the last 40 years combined.. no thanks.
1	Publix on Trenholm is walking around asking customers if they want a COVID shot. There is NO excuse to not be vaccinated.
0	Stop lying to people about the covid vaccine. It doesnt work
0	Here we present evidence that Acuitas' LNPs used in preclinical nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine studies are highly inflammatory in mice. Intradermal and intramuscular injection of these LNPs led to rapid and robust inflammatory responses, characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration, activation of diverse inflammatory pathways, and production of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The same dose of LNP delivered intranasally led to similar inflammatory responses in the lung and resulted in a high mortality rate, with mechanism unresolved.
0	Not to sound cruel or anything like that but it‚Äôs quite interesting to see all of these vaccinated people who attacked so many of us unvaccinated, now coming out with their own pity parties of what happened to them‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..they chose to take that for a JOB!
0	This is not democracy! Stop this vacine
1	This is beautiful and inspiring. Shoutout to the doctors and staff that made the vaccine possible.
0	I got the JandJ vaccine and within two days I was sick. I was not sick before I got the jab.
0	Carry on taking your boosters. I wish you luck with your risk assessment. I prefer natural immunity. Chose wisely, no mandates or money to coerce!
1	It is sad Antivaxers are dying in record numbers in Arkansas.   The health care workers would be smart to relocate to other states, where they won‚Äôt be overwhelmed with trying to save people who can NOT be saved.
0	Sadly, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve even scratched the surface of the number of people who are going to pass because of the vaccine.
0	Everyone who wants it can keep loading up on those shots as much as they want. Not for me.
0	It became readily apparent by February that the COVID vaccines were a complete failure in the well-publicized claims of it‚Äôs effectiveness at preventing COVID infections. Preventing hospitalizations were, at best, dubious. We were getting the faintest whispers of safety concerns. At that point, I pretty much decided not to get vaccinated but was ready to be proven wrong as there should have been a predictable trend of decreasing rates as vaccination rates rose‚Ä¶which it never truly did.
0	I'm never going to get the vaccine because I‚Äôm not a guinea pig
1	My mother in law (late 80‚Äôs and missing part of a lung) is ALIVE because of the vaccine and her boosters.
1	Even when doctors answer all these questions calmly and collectively, they still won't listen and still think think they know better than the professionals. How do you deal with the frustrations of those people not listening and spreading misinformation?
0	I'm not vaxxed and neither is my family. Not worried about it.
1	You can‚Äôt help people that don‚Äôt want to help themselves.
0	Yes, science is to be believed but sometimes it's the scientists that work for pharmaceutical companies that shouldn't be believed. I have a vaccine injury and know others who have suffered since vaccination. Our doctors have told all of us that it's not from the vaccine and don't report it as vaccine injury. Therefore the data on the actual numbers of injured is unreported and inaccurate.
1	Antivaxxers are a herd of dumb sheep. Due for a good docking and drenching.
0	Ive never got the vaccine. Already had covid and I'm ok. I don't need it.
0	One 23 yr old male dropped dead day after, one 40 yr old healthy athletic female now on heart meds, one 55 yr female on heparin 7 months for clots and 45 yr old neighbour developed lumps under each arm, can't raise arms anymore, too bad, she's a farmer. Others more temporary.
0	fake virus to control you.
1	And when you ask them to cite their sources, it‚Äôs always the same response: ‚ÄúGoogle exists, do your rESeArcH.‚Äù
0	"Yeah, so after being completely healthy all my life, one day I handled a poison dart frog. Several hours later I started suffering with swelling, nausea and paralysis".  Interviewer "But how can you be sure the frog caused that?"
1	We needed a safe and viable vaccine last December as soon as we new that SARS-CoV-2 was amongst us, which was impossible of course because we new nothing about the pathogen. Now we‚Äôre in the middle of a pandemic, the need for a vaccine is even greater because as yet, we have no truly effective way of safeguarding ourselves from an illness which can leave some with lifelong problems and even death.
1	I've had 5 shots and just  turned  77 years young. Active and healthy.
1	So you were fully vaccinated, and when you had COVID it was "nothing more than a cold?" Great! That's the point.
1	COVID booster/Influenza vaccine  booked for September
1	I've had so many friends I know suffer with COVID and it's just not worth the risk. The vaccine is the way to go, let's all do our part and beat this thing!
1	I think vaccines are worth it because vaccine-preventable diseases are always expensive
1	Just get vaccinated
0	As a Doctor who is unvaccinated, I totally respect him, Kyrie Irving, and other athletes taking this stance!
1	See, I don't know ANY vaccinated people who have "died suddenly." But I know of quite a few unvaccinated people who have died from Covid. My daughter's mom works in the ER and she's told me all kinds of people who were unvaccinated and died. It was her stories that helped convince me to get vaccinated when I was still on the fence
1	My daughters last COVID dose was the COVID virus and she had no symptoms. ü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è
1	Why do they always tout efficacy rates? I received my first round yesterday (Pfizer), and was all "efficacy this" and "efficacy that" thinking I was so smart... I guess that's the Dunning-Kruger effect.
1	The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been near-miraculous. They‚Äôre the reason why most of us have been able to resume normal activities. Even those Americans who aren‚Äôt vaccinated, although clearly they‚Äôre still at much higher risk than those of us who are vaccinated.
1	Ignore those afraid of needles, the vaccines have been a great success. Anyone who knows even the basics of science understand why they're so successful.
0	I agree the virus doesn't and doesn't want to kill you. However, the remedy does.
1	I think this literally every goddamn day. Every time I read a story about some dumb asshole holding up a flight because they won‚Äôt wear a mask or an antivaxxer orphaning their young children , I‚Äôm just like, for fuck‚Äôs sake, people. Just. Take. The Shot. Just. Put. On. The Mask. Stop making everything so damn difficult for yourself and everybody around you.
1	Just got my first vax this week (finally opened up to my age group). Counting down the days till my second vax. I just fear being left behind by the vaccinated.
0	I don't see the point in getting vaccinated, I don't think COVID-19 is that serious.
0	I'm unvaccinated. I'm not only very much alive, but I'm in splendid health. Sorry, vaccine pushers, but thats just the way it is.
1	It shows how pro-vaccine views and behaviours can take varying forms due to different aims and methods of engagement - oppositional counteractivities in favour of vaccination in Australia, and issue-based advocacy as part of a political alliance in the US.
0	I am not and will never vaccinate.
0	I got the first Pfizer jab, and came to my senses before I took the second. I hope I didn‚Äôt do too much damage.
1	When I took my brother with me to get vaccinated awhile back the nurse doing the shots thanked us like five times, I can only imagine how frustrating it is for healthcare workers to see people choosing not to get their shot over some political nonsense
1	we are essential workers as in we have the right to work and make money rather than see our businesses destroyed like restaurants. Please, we‚Äôre not nurses and doctors. Give the vaccine to people who need it because they are risking their lives for real. Nobody forces you to go on a film shoot (and i‚Äôm shooting movies now). Film people are not doctors and nurses!
1	I‚Äôve had 4 now, still alive, no side effects. So did everyone in my family Had covid once and it wasn‚Äôt bad, only felt under weather for 3 days. No regrets. I don‚Äôt take medical advice from flat earthers
1	It protects you.
1	Got my first dose already, get 2nd dose next week. Thank you First Lady for being such a positive example!!
0	I am not an anti-vax person. I'm also not an anti-common sense person! I'm concerned about the way that these vaccines were rushed to market in less than a year. The vaccine approval process usually takes 5-15 years! I'll wait & see.
0	It‚Äôs not effective, what‚Äôs the point.
1	This is a big deal to me. It's a big deal.
0	If these are so safe why do I have to sign ALL of my rights away if something happens?
1	I'm sorry, but I respectively disagree. There are many people who benefitted from the shot. Especially those with underlying conditions and the elderly.

0	Pro-vaccines are like a joke!!!!! Hate them!!!!!!!!!!
1	I know loads of vaccinated people and am vaccinated myself. I know only one person who was really hit with the vaccine, and they‚Äôre fine now
0	Blood clots all over the place! How do you sleep at night?
0	Nobody should be taking this poison, it's disgusting what's happening to the elderly
1	my mom always says that there are anti-vaxxers today because they didn't see how polio ravaged children - they didn't see the horrors of a truly devastating disease. Parents lined up their children to get that vaccine.
0	Excellent video! Thanks! Some observations: Brazil used the Sinovac vaccine that was produced locally with materials imported from China. Test have shown 50% immunity and 100% death prevention. (100% comes from the trial but such number never exists in reality so we should always consider it to be 99.9% at most). It also have been shown the Sinovac vaccine protects against variants. Brazil, however, used different vaccines like Oxford/AstraZeneca, Jansen and Pfizer. Chile, however, afaik, used only the Sinovac one and it would be interesting if DW could do a report on the Chilean policy and the results they had.  I have recommended friends not to allow their kids to receive DNA and, more importantly, mRNA vaccines. To be clear, I'm a vaccine fan - I love them - but I think these new constructs haven't been tested enough and no one can guarantee no serious long term effect will occur. I received Oxford/AZ twice, Pfizer once and Jansen once - I'm almost 50 and don't consider these vaccines will have long term negative effects on me. My niece, however, who's 10, received the Sinovac one. It's called Coronavac here and it's basically an 1950s Salk construct with dead whole viruses.   My preocupation with the genetic vaccines is how much spike protein they'll produce and in the case of mRNA the possible problem with the lipid capsules in relation to women's reproductive system. (to be honest, I'm not uptaded on the subject but given the importance and characteristics of women's reproductive system¬π being over-cautiion is, imho, is called for). The aspect of these vaccines that are common to all genetic constructs is the spike protein - they all (afaik) work by producing this protein but it's precisely the spike protein that can cross the blood-brain bareer and is citotoxic.   1) For those who don't know: women's reproductive cells are all there since birth and are more complex than men's cells. My preoccupation is that an exposure to something for a long time could damage those cells.
0	Can you please explain why people who are double and triple vaxed are still contracting the virus and getting sick from it? Considering your description of how the vax works :)
0	Oh no I can't afford to buy an experimental drug.
1	No shit. This was the largest vaccination campaign in history. Literally billions of dosages. If the vaccine was dangerous, anti-vax people wouldn't have be sharing the same dozen or so horror stories. We'd all know.
0	If we disregard vaccines and faith in God. What I can say only is this, if you go out from your houses try to wear face mast. This will protect you from covid
1	This is very interesting. Sounds to me like you could use this new mRNA vaccines for cancer. #GAMECHANGER
0	Who ever took the vaccine you guys are thE governments Guinea pigs for a man made virus.
0	As corporate ‚Äújournalists‚Äù begin to suffer from the clot shots, their TV bosses demand they blame anything BUT THE COVID VACCINES on air to keep Big Pharma happy.
1	I‚Äôve been waiting 2 years. I‚Äôm vaccinated and boosted. Incredibly , I have never been hospitalized for COVID.
1	The reason for the fast development of the vaccine is prior knowledge of these types of viruses, it's not half baked, it has been tested. I will for sure get my shots
0	PROPAGANDA BIG PHARMA TRASH!!!!!
1	The COVID-19 vaccines have already saved countless lives, and they will continue to save even more as more and more people get vaccinated. Let's do what we can to protect ourselves and others by getting vaccinated.
1	Took my vaccine today. My arm feels heavy and it‚Äôs painful to lay on that side, lift my arm or make sudden moves. I took the Pfizer. I feel fine tho.

0	The number of deaths would be lower if we did not have the vaccine.
0	Peddlers of poison
0	You see the thing is.......it's not a vaccine.
1	I hate these new Twitter algorithms because people like you and those women with their fake ‚Äúpost vaccination tremors‚Äù are everywhere on my FYP. COVID vaccines were safe and effective for the majority of people worldwide that received them. Stop with this nonsense.
1	I'm from Poland and I'm fully vaccinated. For covid too. I'm happy about that!
0	I will take no vaccine until I have been properly tested for the anti-bodies for that specific disease!
1	My husband and I just got the COVID vaccine today on the 1st day that it became available
0	Death reports PROVE that the COVID vaccines are killing people of all ages and should be immediately stopped
1	My grandpa died the day after Christmas and was positive for Covid yet he had his vaccine and booster. So sad for those that pass away from COVID
1	yes I want be having it and I am 74 my body my choice
1	Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a safer, more reliable way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect people by creating an immune response without the potentially severe illness or post-COVID conditions that can be associated with COVID-19 infection.
0	Conspiracy Anti- vax believed Sinovac vaccine is danger from Asia except Vaccine from West
1	You are 3x less likely to get covid if you have a vaccine, and you clear the virus faster, reducing your likelihood transmission significantly if you are vaccinated.
1	Pro-Vaccine rejection is a problem severely impacting the global society, especially considering the COVID-19 outbreak.
0	I'll take my chances and not get the vaccine either.
0	I only know a pair of people in my family and close friends who suffered COVID-19.  Both were like having a severe bout of flu.  Non got so serious to need hospitalization.  With that said.  I can see some people with preexisting conditions that could have life threatening complications from it.  We just have to learn to live with it and take all necessary recommended measure to increase our odds of getting out of this unscathed.
1	Don't wait for the virus to come to you, go to the vaccine first.
0	you do know that vaccinated people can spread covid as well, don't you?
1	Got the AZ shot yesterday. I had fever at night, hurting muscles but I'm good now. Take the shot.
1	I'm a doctor, I'll bite.  But it has to be in public so our readers can watch it happen.  I'll start: the three miracles of modern medicine are anesthesia (making surgery possible), antibiotics, and vaccines. Your turn. Watchya got?
0	My grown daughter got Moderna shots, and has lupus symptoms for months, exhaustion for months, sore throats, you name it.
1	why are all antivaxxers two week old account with zero followers? We provaxxers are the real ones and must make our voices heard too
1	To avoid burdening the healthcare system, taking the jab would reduce the risk of more severe reactions to the bug.
0	We‚Äôre any of you vaccinated because the vaccine seems to cause Covid .
1	I totally respect people who don‚Äôt want to get a #vacation , makes the row shorter for me to get one! #provaccination
0	A year after I got vaccinated the benign brain tumor I had doubled in size. I needed brain resection. Am not getting the booster. Scary stuff
0	I had one shot and permanently I lost 80% of my testosterone and feel tired all the time, my life's biggest regret.
1	Going to get my vaccine now, hope you do aswell!
0	45. "I think the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19."
0	Unvaxxed...if I had then I'd prob be dead. Not worth the risk.
1	Dear conspiracy theorists; I think it‚Äôs so cute you think you‚Äôre important or interesting enough to control. Lmfaooooooo
1	I'm so glad I finally got my shot! I was nervous but it was a piece of cake, thanks to the amazing healthcare workers. Can't wait till everyone's vaccinated and we can beat this virus for good
1	And yes, I get the flu shot every year.
0	Mentioned to my #council a few years ago that I did not want anyone who had been #vaccinated coming anywhere near my home because of #shedding (after asked if there was anyone‚Äù exhibiting signs of #covid üòÇ), to which they took offence &amp; called me an #AntiVaxxer‚Ä¶ https://t.co/uQCX5coBQ2
0	The genocide vaccine
0	Stop killing people
1	Not one antivaxxer on this page is a doctor of medicine. Literally the least qualified group are convinced they are in possession of knowledge the actual experts have overlooked. Mad as a bag of frogs...
0	Is this an admission that the vaccine is deadly?
1	The point is...that FOUR of my neighbors died of Covid in 2021, not vaccinated.   The fact is that my mom at 98 years old, full vaccinated got Covid in 2022 and had no symptoms at all.
1	At this point the unvaccinated ones should just be fired. It's ridiculous almost 2 years later that they're having to require it for these idiots to do it.
0	Boycott all companies requiring a covid passport.
1	Although as a Canadian with a right to a choice, ill take any except for the Astrazeneca one.
0	it's like a flu shot? should i feel better about that?
1	I‚Äôve gotten 4 or 5 so far, but I won‚Äôt get another if I have to pay.
0	I'm fortunate enough that I've never needed any covid vaccines - and the more I see the more glad this makes me.
0	Bill Gates wants to reduce world population, he wants most of us dead. What could possibly go wrong by having his technology injected into your body?
0	My mom is 70, unvaccinated, and had the flu! I am unvaccinated and never stopped for a day. All my friends vaccinated were sick as hell!
1	For all those who hesitate to vaccinate here is a 1950's pic of caring for victims of polio. #provaccination
1	Saying "I trust my immune system" during a pandemic is like saying "I trust my circulatory system" while you walk around nude in the Arctic circle. You get to be 'right', for a little while.

1	Vaxxed and ready to take on the world! Let's get everyone protected and beat this virus once and for all
0	I trust this stuff about as much as I trust the people pedalling it.
0	You'd need a PhD in immunology from Jethro Bodine University at Bugtussle to really appreciate this bullshit.
0	that‚Äôs good for you, but I can verify that the virus is very dangerous. My husband‚Äôs cousin died last year about the time of year in Indiana. I also had a friend that died from Covid. I‚Äôm pretty sure that they both got Remdisivor after being hospitalized. I was vented for 10 days in December of 2021. My husband told the medical team NOT to give me Remdesivir. My family was told numerous times that I would die. Thousands were praying for me. Beyond all understanding of the doctors, I lived. But 8 of the 14 people in the ICU when I was there died. I just don‚Äôt want to give anyone a false illusion of the seriousness of the disease. I‚Äôm still unvaccinated. There has been no research that has emerged that the vaccine is safe. Research is coming out that natural immunity is better then the vaccine. But‚Ä¶ I also know that I‚Äôm rolling the dice with counting on my natural immunity.
1	I so appreciate the scientists who made this possible
1	My phone just died.. Must be from the vaccine!
0	I don't think the COVID-19 vaccine has been tested enough, and I don't want to be a guinea pig for Big Pharma.
0	I had persistent chest pain after getting the vaccine.
0	Anyone that is still in favor of the COVID "vaccines" is either in denial, ridiculously stupid, or acting with nefarious intent.
0	I'll stick to my natural antibodies! No, thanks to VACCINES!
0	Stop the lethal injections
0	There are no benefits just more money for big pharma
1	My unvaccinated mother had it a little over a year ago. She still has no energy, no appetite, screwed up sense of taste and smell, emotionally labile and neurological consequences. Not¬†risks I'm willing to take.
0	Covid 19 vaccine will kill you
1	See, I don't know ANY vaccinated people who have "died suddenly." But I know of quite a few unvaccinated people who have died from Covid. My daughter's mom works in the ER and she's told me all kinds of people who were unvaccinated and died. It was her stories that helped convince me to get vaccinated when I was still on the fence
1	The link between autism and vaccines is made-up. The original study was completely falsified. Protecting kids from harmful disease that we can prevent is the important thing. Herd Immunity only goes so far
1	Kid: :)When I grow up- Anti-vaxx parent: Whoa, I'm gonna stop you right there.
1	We need to be getting a booster every 3 months for it to be effective.
0	Thank you for the video and for daring to speak out the scientific truths against the narrative,1
1	My kid is 3 and this is one of my biggest fears right now. And I hate that any vaccine development for this age group feels like it just stopped.
0	All colleges need to stop mandates as well. Many young people are required to take a shot that offers little to no benefit but has a high rate of harm.
0	I started having palpitations after my vaccine, but of course my dr. claimed they were unrelated. (I‚Äôm an otherwise healthy 29 year old. I‚Äôm no doctor but to me they seem very much related to my vaccine)
1	HPV vaccines are powerful, safe and lifesaving against cervicalcancer & critical to eliminating the disease
1	I would recommend it to a lot of people that don't want to get it and a lot of those people voted for me, frankly.
0	Considering you‚Äôve made the Covid vaccine into a commercial would you mind listing the side effects?
0	So in short it fukkkks you up ... My immune system is super strong ... That is my protection ... These jabs have NOT been tested thoroughly...
1	Almost nobody has suffered a vaccine injury. You do realise that not even over the counter drugs like Aspirin are 100% free of side effects?
1	I'm sick of the rants about the COVID vaccine causing myocarditis. The COVID virus itself causes myocarditis 100 times more often than the vaccine itself. Literally! This means that if you are really afraid of myocarditis then you should DEFINITELY get vaccinated. Good Tuesday!
0	Pure blood for life
0	After her second dose of Pfizer last year my wife had a heart attack the next morning. She is fit, well and healthy. Now she is battling heart issues that they can't define and our Dr says it is vaccine related but is the only one to admit it. They are covering this up at a massive scale.
0	"I'm not trying to persuade you." is what someone who is trying to persuade you would say.
0	This make me nuts "No proof that is working" and same thing whit covid vacine..
1	The vaccine wasn‚Äôt rushed it was streamlined. This is what happens when scientists and doctors are given the funds, support, equipment and staff numbers they need
1	"i did my own research" You mean, you googled it and found 68 results that contradicted your opinion and found ONE that validated it.
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why  anyone would  give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually.
1	Sounds like the vaccines are doing a good job of preventing severe disease. Unvaccinated people are subject to recurrent infections since their antibodies wane as well.
0	I'm not getting the damn vaccine.

0	GOOD FOR HIM!!! WE NEED MORE PEOPLE AGAINST THESE DEADLY VACCCCCCX
1	Literally Billions of inoculations around the world...Billions of boosters...very, very few adverse reactions...
1	I should also speak out that the vaccine probably saved me from having to go to hospital or suffering long covid symptoms thank you vaccine
1	I  already was able to get a 4th injection. Definitely reduces risk of serious illness and death, not getting virus.
0	The real concern is about the long term risks associated with taking the trial and error "vaccine"

0	I won‚Äôt be taking any more of the shots, nor have I encouraged my kids to take them. It‚Äôs been a series of lies from the beginning, ranging from the origins coverup, censoring information, to Big Pharma and the medicinal industry controlling covid treatments for profit, all while people suffered and died from treatments that could have been done and adverse reactions to the ouchie they still want to censor.

0	One naturally forgoes the covid vaccine because there is no reason whatsoever to take it. Common sense. You don't stuff yourself with medicines and crap unless it's absolutely necessary. Especially not experimental ones.
1	I have a question, how are the companies going to increase production from 8 to 10 million per week?  If they can do 10 million then why not 20.  And why were they only at 8 before?
0	When something is being pushed like these vaccines, it causes me concern. I think the lack of trust in the media/government is number one for me
0	since governments are giving them 100% protection from liability, it's not a good sign.
0	Her first wrong choice was listening TFG her next was not taking the vaccine
0	Don‚Äôt get the shot!!!
0	Wow way to catch up to 90% of what the public already did
1	Thank you, to these people who are @ the front of the line for us, but please get vaccinated, it is so important. keep safe everyone
1	Vaccinate the world!
0	Personally I do not my original DNA genetics altered.
1	The politicians who are anti-vax, anti-mask, anti-Covid-$ should be ashamed of themselves and be voted out of office on this aspect alone. Some of the resistance comes from liberals, the majority from our new GOP, but vote them all out .
0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
1	Then if they‚Äôre so against it when they get COVID-19 they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to take up an ICU bed or the care that somebody else could use. If you want to do nothing to prevent or reduce your symptoms to keep you out of said hospital. Than whenyou get it you should have to deal with it on your own. STOP putting other people at risk.
0	I dont trust mrna tech vaccines
0	So we weren't conspiracy theorists after all!!!

1	Please get vaccinated and save lives and yours.
1	before you say you refuse to take the vaccine because you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in it, name every single ingredient in the soda you drink, poptarts u eat and ur toothpaste without looking it up
0	No it does more harm than it does good
1	I was the same way. I was like hell no am I getting it. But then I researched it, and I talked to drs about it and now I can confidently say that when it comes to us we will be getting it!
1	People that are refusing it are dumb. You‚Äôre going to have to take it eventually anyway not sure why people are putting it off.
1	All vaccines are good. My point here is that having a choice is already a privilege in itself.
1	I have been greatly surprised by how the immune system works in my body. I am glad to be a human who owns the immune system. Thanks for the summarization of the research contents.
1	Got my first Covid shot. No symptoms except a slightly sore arm. The two Shingles shots I got last year HURT my arm.
0	If vaccines are so great, why aren't they mentioned in the bible?
1	Everyone should watch and consider getting vaccinated! We deserve our livelihood back.
1	seroius side effects of the vaccines are very rare. Vaccines are safe.
0	MRNA translates RNA into amino acid pairs to create proteins. What happens when proteins are damaged? Problems with blood clotting, hormones, immune function, etc. All side effects we have seen so far are in fact from the problems with protein synthesis within the body.
1	Antivaxers put others at risk so why put the rest of the workforce at risk by employing them. The other other issue is that they are fuckwits so why would you want them in your organisation?
0	Let's look at the fact checkers..  Funded and staffed by the very people profiting the most from the vaccines. Massive, criminal conflict of interest
0	LOL, not a chance I would get any vaccine let alone the biggest fraud vaccine in the world. https://t.co/hPIBtcyWTM
0	The vaccine keeps giving our seniors blood clots, strokes, and paralysis.
1	Even though covid-19 vaccines are an important step in slowing down the spread of the virus
1	I got the COVID-19 vaccine ‚Äì I'm free, COVID-19 can't catch me anymore.
1	thank you for your message. we need more of this in the world right now. because the subject has many confusing elements to it (e.g. exponential growth, CFR vs IFR, excess deaths, the flu kills x) people are getting confused. many do not accept how serious it is and think the figures are trumped up.
1	I‚Äôve had many COVID jabs and my heart and lungs throb with the energy of a thousand suns, it‚Äôs also hip AND trendy. What are you waiting for?
0	What about your heart exploding? Or any one of the other 1,200 effects?
0	I'm by no means 'anti vax'  But, this last year or so there has been a spat of people I know, all young and healthy people... having heart attacks and strokes.   Youngest, a guy, mid 20s, gym goer, non drinker / smoker, good shape, active lifestyle. Had a heart attack.  Oldest, late 50s. Again, active woman in good health. Had regular health checks through her job. Had a stroke, followed by a heart attack.  Both have passed. Both fulley jabbed up...  Everyone I know who has had bad symptoms from covid, who is struggling with 'long covid' are people that have been jabbed.  The people that have not had any jabs and have had covid have all been fine. Maybe a day or so of feeling crap.   The second time I had covid, I had no symptoms at all, and I've had no jabs.   Not to don a tin foil hat here, but the life experience of the people around me ( I live on a small island so it's quite the close community of everyone knowing everyone ) and the people I know from further afield through work and hobbies.. tell me that the jabs are not doing anyone any favours.   Might all just be a huge coincidence... but lets be honest. Doubt it.
0	I don't believe in the vaccine because I heard it contains harmful ingredients that could harm my health.
0	The COVID-19 vaccine has caused more harm than good.
0	12. "I think it's important for everyone to get vaccinated to help end the pandemic."
1	Why dont UsA compare its covid performance to asian countries and australia? Quite highly vaccinated and theyve had small amounts of vaccine injury, but incredibly small mortality from covid. The issue here is that the US has become an increasingly consistent underperformer in the world.
1	New study on children from birth to 19 says there were 821 deaths in this age group during about a 15 month period I believe it was. Not nearly as many as adults but too many for those who hardly lived their lives. It was the 8th leading cause of death. Also, more child mortality than from either the flu or pneumonia.
0	Go get the shot and end up with life long health problems, miscarriages, heart problems and death!
0	My som dr advise me ‚Äúnot to ‚Äúgive my son the vaccine because of this and I‚Äôm in agreement MY SON WASNT GETTING IT ANYWAYS!
1	My husband did so good with all vaccines and boosters. He's stage 5 10% kidney disease we were so scared. We recently had omicron and I had only been vaccinated, no boosters I did worse then he did. He's waiting on this booster to get it
1	Vaccines have prevented many diseases from spreading and causing harm
0	HAVING SIDE EEFECTS, MIOCARTITS, ARE SICK ALL THE TIME SONCE, HAVING HEART PROBLEMS.
1	I‚Äôm an ex antivax too. Anti many things. It ruined my career but I‚Äôm making the most of my post-conspiracy life now. It‚Äôs hard but it‚Äôs possible to overcome past trauma that led you to this path.
0	I'm still proudly unvaccinated. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one I know who hasnt gotten it. I feel for those who were forced being in healthcare, travel or almost any other corporate job. I work for myself so I didnt feel pressured but I've lied when I went to a Dr. Or hospital. I just don't want to hear it.
1	Got the Booster ( Moderna ) Just like the first two shots (Pfizer) I felt nothing. Nurse assured me she vaccinated me. Pointed to the band aid. Still can't believe that millions are making a fuss over this painless prick.
0	"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."
0	Everyone who suffered a vaccine related injury should sue any entity that required them to get their shot.  Whether that's a private employer or a gub'ment entity.  Make it real painful financially so it never happens again.
1	I intend to take the vaccine as soon as it‚Äôs available. There are two reasons for this:1. The selfish reason is that I‚Äôm tired. I suspect that I‚Äôve been stricter than most about my adherence to physical distancing  2. The more important reason is that I consider it a duty to my patients, most of whom are elderly. My temperature gets checked every day that I work, but I‚Äôm young, and there is a chance I could be asymptomatic even if affected. The last thing I would want is to unwittingly infect my patient. It‚Äôs my worst nightmare. Even the thought of it mortifies me.guidelines, and I‚Äôd love to be able to relax and head to a restaurant again.
0	I literally laugh at anyone who drove to a parking lot to get pumped full of drugs from complete strangers
0	#vaccinated #vaccinegenocide  #VaccineDeaths #COVID19 #unvaccinated  The last time I said some doctors have failed during the pandemic I got booted from Twitter for 12 days.  Now that @elonmusk is running the show let's see what happens this time.   https://t.co/CEgfJTR6Cl
1	While I wasn't doubting the vaccine, this cleared up my confusion on the differences between the vaccines. I really appreciate this video. We're almost there!
0	Im not getting it! JUst stop this propaganda...
1	To protect my parents and grandparents, I'll take the vaccine
0	The unvaccinated were smarter than the scientists and health experts. People mocked and ridiculed us. But we stood firm. We did not get poisoned by the vaccines.
0	Another article claiming the vaccine works and it doesn‚Äôt. It will not prevent your from getting it or transmitting it. It may help lessen the affects but that is a prophylactic not a vaccine. Words matter.
0	These dudes are way to enthusiastic about getting injected!!!
0	The fact that they‚Äôre trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you
0	It's amazing how people would rather live a lie then except they've been lied to.
1	Can't wait to get my Pfizer booster shot in November. Fully vaccinated since May.
0	Stick you poison it doesn‚Äôt work doesn‚Äôt stop transmission and causes damage to the heart and nervous system fact
1	I wonder if this takes into account how many kids with cancer, chronic lung disease, and heart disease were killed by COVID. Though, according to antivaxxers, they have cOmOrBiDiTiEs so their lives don‚Äôt matter enough for the rest of us to accept minor inconveniences to save them
0	Who told you to take the vaccine and boosters? ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
1	Vaccines help with less severe symptoms.
0	I never got the v or have had Covid and I work in healthcare! I‚Äôve seen lots of new cancer cases since the v!
0	The Surgeon General said that if you get the vaccine  you will not die from Covid-19.   That's a LIE!
1	So glad I did get vaccinated and boosted and wore a mask and social distanced. And I am here in good health. Unlike my Uncle and a colleague who both didn't have that chance in 2020.
1	Vaccines reduce the risk of COVID-19,
1	At least if vaxed,you won't land up in hospital....GET IT!! or must I draw a picture.....go get vaxed dammit!!!!!
0	Japan, universal masking and extremely high vaccination rate with mRNA vaccine, seems to have increasingly devastating waves of Covid with death rates climbing each time. Safe and effective pfizer eh?
1	the BioNTech story makes me happy to be German, great couple, great vaccine!
0	The people that remained unvaccinated are very happy thank you very much
1	One down...one to go! Excellent vaccination service at the @WorcsAcuteNHS, thank you üíâü¶† #CovidVaccine‚Ä¶ https://t.co/9FIuPlD66Y
1	Why do you think vaccines are destroying the immune system? That's crazy. As I said, vaccines improve the immune system by teaching it how to recognize the virus and fight against it in a way that is far safer than a real infection. That's how and why they work.
1	Vaccination is the most efficient strategy for preventing infectious disease.¬†Stay up-to-date on getting recommended vaccines.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a powerful tool in the fight against this virus.
0	Its been 8 month and i haven't taken my covid vaccine
0	There  are so many doctors out there  advising people not to take it  due to its negative effects.They say it is not safe and it is not even proven to prevent the virus. For me men of God should just tell people that they are not medical doctors and donot have any idea how vaccine works.Rather than encouraging people to take what they themselves don't even know the content of it.
0	Just think. Taking a sampling of everyone's ( world population) DNA...just imagine what they are building now!?
0	Vaccines do not create immunity, they create customers
0	I trust my immune system
1	Getting vaccinated is an act of love for ourselves and for others.
1	If it's the vaccine or covid I'd rather have the vaccine than the chance of permanent lung scarring and circulatory system damage but maybe that's just me
1	Getting vaccinated is a small action with a big impact on our world.
0	Your vaccine has failed to protect me from Covid-19. I also felt sick with my heart after your vaccine. I developed Long Covid which was debilitating. India & S Africa have repurposed anti- inflammatory drugs successfully. No deaths, No Long Covid with no oxygen & no vaccines
0	Personally, I don't mind being called ANTI-VAX. After watching my family fall apart ; my 5 year old brother losing his mum to a covid-19 vaccine so suddenly I think I ; everyone else suffering because of these "vaccines" has earned the right to question what's put into our bodies
0	That's why I ain't never took that damn shot
1	Proud of my wife. 1st dose done.
0	no vaccines, no boosters, always lived like before as far as possible. lots of contact with strangers in public transportation and at work. never had covid.
0	I don't understand the point being made by the "expert".  You can't mandate a vaccination on an entire population including kids when the standard scientific protocols have not been followed.  Nazarin had it right on her sign, "All of the Risks" are on the public who are putting blind trust in a product that has failed to meet the most basic standards.  How can it even be considered a vaccination if it does not protect from infection or transmission?  The only immunity provided in regards to these Jabz is immunity from lawsuits for Big Pharma.
0	There are no credible data to prove the long-term safety and efficacy of this vaccine. At this stage, it‚Äôs still experimental, even if all regulatory approvals are in place.
0	Side effects are concerning
0	It takes years for side effects to appear, and they could very well be worse than the sickness.
1	Vaccination is the best way to protect ourselves and others from COVID-19.
0	CDC agrees what most knew early on: Vaccine doesn't prevent infection, transmission, or illness. Does this make any sense outside vaccine interests?  Covid-19 vaccine mandate continues for foreigners arriving via air
0	No thanks! Convid does not exist and the vaccines are poison. Not one vaccine on Earth is good for us. The rich Evil Elite are depopulating the Earth.
0	I will decline the covid-19 vaccine because no one knows the long term side effects and the short term side effects for someone my age would make me 100x more likely to have serious heart issues for the rest of my life.
0	BREAKING: Data shows Canada had way more Covid deaths in 2022, with an 85% vaccinated population than in 2020, with a 0% vaccinated population.
0	Imagine a product so awful that you have to lobby for tyrannical laws just so ppl will buy it.
1	Getting vaccinated helps protect the most vulnerable individuals.
1	Just get the vaccine. Thousands of smart people are working on them. Smarter than me a probably smarter than you.There will be another pandemic. We are in the middle of a buch of crises. We need to trust each other.
0	My body my choice,,, not taking it.
1	As someone who has had covid and the vaccines , the vaccines where a walk in the park compared  to natrual infection.  Colleagues who had a wordr natrual infection had more nastier vaccine  symptoms.   It just depends on your  immune system  in regards to both
1	Yes, I support the Vaccine. No, I don‚Äôt support mandates.
0	Forcing people to take dangerous, unproven injections through mass mediatic hysteria and legal corruption of governments. These companies are a threat to our societies and must be eradicated
0	CVS is not ready! Not where I live. No vaccines! Requiring the elderly to register online to get an appointment is laughable!
0	ALL vaccines are toxic to the body & are totally unnecessary - strong immune system is what needs to remain healthy or heal itself #Organic
0	This is not even close to being the end of virus/paranoia pandemics.
0	Never ever ever get it
0	I got the Pfizer vaccine in Jan 2021 and started having excruciating chest pain. Been in the hospital three times and they can't figure out why I'm having the pain.
1	The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be 76% and 72% effective, respectively, at preventing symptomatic COVID-19.
1	Love you Dr Dianne! We‚Äôre looking forward to the day we can get the vaccine too!!
0	I trust my immune system
1	The spread of covid within China is alarming. Having adopted zero covid policy and now totally withdrawing all restrictions within China it is for America and other nations to impose controls to prevent its spread. This is all the more important to restrict or prevent mutant varieties. Unlike Chinese where the government has not changed its policy of allowing other vaccines ,the rest of the world luckily has access to more effective vaccines
0	Its proven that the vaccine doesn't protect you from getting Covid and it doesn't prevent you from spreading it‚Ä¶
0	None of the Vaccine manufacturers are willing to GUARANTEE their product. They have all been granted legal and civil immunity in the event of adverse reactions and/or death. That doesn‚Äôt inspire a lot of confidence.
1	the vaccine is safe. My whole family is vaccinated. Get yours now!
1	I‚Äôm one of the 14% of Americans that thankfully received a bivalent booster shot in September. I believe that those of us keeping ourselves and others safe by still using every precaution (vaccines, masking, distancing and avoiding crowds) should be rewarded with the opportunity to take a second bivalent booster when the first one wears off.
0	got my first shot. Feeling incredibly sick. Throw up, fatigue and soreness. Posted that on facebook and got told that the vaccine doesnt cause you to get sick and I was banned for 24 hours lol
0	SHAMEFUL GOVERNMENT!!!   GREED over human safety.  Pretense and fear for control! Nuremberg is waiting for you
1	Long covid is real and affects enough people to be a significant factor. Data suggests that it is less likely in a vaccinated individual. Granted that covid is a sneaky virus, all we can do is get vaccinated, and wear a mask indoors in crowded settings.
0	If you have to be persuaded, reminded, pressured, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, blackmailed, threatened, punished and criminalized...if all of this is considered necessary to gain your compliance for a drug they want to hide the data on for 75 years and is proven to be ineffective--you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.

1	Finally the vaccines are available, gonna get my soon
1	Every vaccine helps. Nobody can tell what the virus will or will not do to a person at any age. There are young people dying, and there are young people who survive and have possibly life long after effects.
1	They‚Äôd watch their family members get smallpox and blame it on the Jews.
0	Vaccines given today are 2 years out of date....they will lesson symptoms, but it is bizarre that they are considered "vaccines" when the virus has mutated/adapted numerous times since it began.  Would you think that a Flu vaccine from 2019 would help you avoid the flu in 2021?
1	Im so tired of the antivax garbage that runs rampant in this country. Theyre not going to chip you. Youre not going to get turned into a bioweapon. For fucks sake. You wont get fucking autism or whatever the fuck else people say you will.
0	I'm praying for the Vaccinated. Everyday new research comes out with new concerning surprises.
0	There are no credible data to prove the long-term safety and efficacy of this vaccine. At this stage, it‚Äôs still experimental, even if all regulatory approvals are in place.
1	Yes absolutely! Partly because I am multisick, and also because I have home care services who have to be careful because they take care of many elderly people. So both for myself and out of solidarity with others at risk, I will be vaccinating myself.
0	It's really hard to believe that so many people are still advocating periodic booster doses of these Covid vaccines! As for the claim that they are "safe and effective", how is it possible that people are still repeating this when there is so much evidence that they aren't?
1	The actual data shows the vaccines to be safe.
0	Google and Twitter are no longer censoring truth about Covid and Vaccine crimes.
0	Ask anyone that lives in or commutes through any big city in the US and they can all attest to that they see the exact same homeless people doing just fine (all things considered).  How can this possibly be the case, if covid is that "deadly and contagious" as big Pharma just spent $billions trying to convince us that it is? Also, a Yale study just proved that if you have had covid, then you have the antibodies and that there is no benefit in getting the vaccine if so.  2+2=?
0	I never got even single vaccine of covid 19, even i never got any test, if i am sick, i get some rest and take the pil which necessary, eat meat and some fruit, breath just like the old time and thank god i am healthy
0	No thanks , I don't need a vaccine for a virus I aint got
0	Persistent difficulty breathing or swallowing was another side effect I experienced after getting the vaccine.
1	making everyone sick won't really help though since the antibodies will still go away eventually and they won't last longer, also the whole point of vaccines is that they basically make you sick with COVID-19 just without any symptoms, so getting a vaccine is as good as getting sick.
1	I love how when you present scientific evidence, people still don‚Äôt believe you and say you‚Äôre being paid for this and/or pushing an agenda. Believe your conspiracy theories all you want... I‚Äôm going to choose to not live in fear.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a critical tool in controlling the spread of the virus. Let's all do our part to get vaccinated.

1	I will be getting my boosters as soon as i can along with my family!
0	My mum had astrazeneca had stroke after her 2nd 1 now her booster she has blood and liver worries
0	About time.  Very unfortunate for the one that took the deaths shot already
0	Do younger people with a better than 99.5% chance of survival need to risk the possible negative affects of the vaccine? https://t.co/Fh0MFEVAk2
1	Damn a lot of vaccinated people on this sub are now sounding like the unvaccinated when mask mandates and social distancing were first issued. Empathy has gone out the window and selfish thinking has jumped right in. The hypocrisy makes me sad. I‚Äôm 29, healthy, vaccinated and still wear my mask in public. It‚Äôs not about me. It‚Äôs about protecting others, even if I disagree with their choices not to get the vaccine.
0	How about the misinformation presented to my friends and family members. They never had Covid, but they were forced to take the jab. Two had strokes, one of them-is now paralyzed. The other two were working in the medical field when forced. One developed a blood clot in the spine and was paralyzed for half a year, the other a blood clot in the heart requiring open heart surgery. Since they didn‚Äôt have Covid to start, there is only one other cause. These victims don‚Äôt speak out, but I am speaking out for them.
0	You made me realize something.  I kept hearing people say this, that "misery loves company" and such but I never actually understood how it applies here. But if the vax turns out to have potentially debilitating side effects a few decades from now, or if some people develop heart conditions, etc. it explains why my concerns have to be shot down so fiercely. Because to acknowledge there's even the slightest possibility I might be right is very disturbing to them.
1	Delighted to have been vaccinated today
1	I got my first dose 2 days ago too!! Luckily did not experience any side effects, just the sore arm. My brother is waiting for me to turn into a zombie too üòÇüòÇ
1	Preventing hospitalization and death is more important than preventing infection in general. It's not really unexpected breakthrough infections can happen. Vaccines are about lowering the risk, and sometimes that may be almost completely but especially when working with coronaviruses it's not surprising there is a chance of infection even if it's lower---the point is that the chance is smaller enough to make a difference, and it's especially important that it is reducing risk of death and serious illness. Unvaccinated people are still more likely to die and become seriously ill, and that's something we want to prevent.
0	Still unvaccinated and healthy as ever thank you Jesus
0	I prefer to eat my microchips.
0	Sadly I know of too many people who are having issues after the 3rd booster jab. It's very alarming.
1	i had the vaccine on tuesday im fine
0	Considering that doctors are basically paid to sell drugs by the pharmaceutical companies, it‚Äôs very easy to still be skeptic even with what you‚Äôre sayin. Yes, some conspiracies sound outlandish and ridiculous, but the fact they damn near forcing people to get it. Paying people to get it. It‚Äôs very sketchy to me.
1	Hungarian scientists compared the rates after vaccination of 3.7 million Hungarians with five vaccines: Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sputnik-V and Sinopharm. Sputnik V has been named the most effective coronavirus vaccine in Hungary. The Russian Sputnik V vaccine has shown the best protection against deaths from COVID-19 in Hungary compared to the other five vaccines used in the country.
1	I had my booster vaccine and flu shot 12 days ago! No problems with any of the vaccines.
1	omg how is it that you do not know that vaccines don‚Äôt completely prevent you from getting covid, they Do reduce the chances of you getting it and more importantly they reduce the severity of the symptoms.
1	Glad I found this video to show my parents! They‚Äôre 88 and 87 and had an appointment to get the vaccine but my anti vac brothers talked them out of it with a videoso I‚Äôm going to play yours for them this morning. Great information!! Thank you for taking the time to make this video
1	i got my second dose yesterday, definitely questioning life rn. IT SUCKS BUT ITS WORTH IT
1	Such a tiny amount die from the vaccines, the benefits outweigh risks. I‚Äôve had 4 no side affect, it‚Äôs to produce antibodies,doesn‚Äôt prevent but helps with severity for those with underlying conditions, I know several who died no shot, or became very sick. I get flu shots too!
0	Bill Gates tells us what we already know‚Ä¶  The COVID-19 vaccine don‚Äôt work.
1	Live Higher and you'll Live longer ! Ty Sir's and Ma'am !
0	I don't know but I choose not to get the shot I even skip my flu shot this year lack of trust.
1	It astounds me that people are more afraid of a vaccine than getting a serious disease and ending up in the hospital on a respirator or dying.
0	The people that remained unvaccinated are very happy thank you very much
0	Everyone involved needs to be tried, convicted and executed, from top government officials, Pharma execs, those who administered the jabs, down to the tik tok dancing nurses murdering with the medical protocols.
0	I love how the reporter talks about needing stats for objectivity. Hmm.... I wonder if she is currently looking at the massive spike in heart attacks, myocarditis, strokes and neurological disorders and the particular increase of this in young people in the last year? Also what about the stats of healthy sports stars who just died in the prime of their lives in 2021 ? Are those stats worth a look?
0	I have a recommendation I would never take the shot.
0	The information control is the worst part of this pandemic.

0	My 19 year old nephew had a heart attack from the COVID vaccine. His heart Dr stated the vaccine caused inflammation in his heart. He is now on heart medication for the rest of his life. The damage is irreversible.
1	These vaccines have been test properly. Your military vaccines might not have, I don't know because I haven't seen the data. But all the widely use Covid-19 vaccines have been tested properly. You wouldn't find a more tested vaccine in human history.
1	vaccines have proven as safe as they are effective in protecting against serious coronavirus illness.
0	I was perfectly fine before the 2 shots. Now I have chest pains. Maybe it's not MYOCARDITIS but it definitely didn't just START out of the BLUE one week after getting my second dose.
0	I was looking up the average daily deaths due to covid for the month of July and it's been between 150 to 250 deaths a day in all of the United States. It says that in 2018 an average of 2,380 people died of heart disease every day in the US which is about the average every year. So this is not about our health. It's about something else...
1	I got the vaccine to protect my vulnerable family and because it will (statistically) save my life.
0	I think that the vaccines may be a way for the Big Pharma to earn money
0	Who wants more poison? #fuckmoderna #fuckpfizer #fuckthecorruptgovernment
0	I've never seen so much lying and deception surrounding any one particular topic before this one, in my entire life.
1	Vaccination is the best thing.
0	Being unvaccinated is more safer than being vaccinated. Please give us a break. The effects of being vaccinated may not be 2 or 3 days journey. It could even up to 5 -10 years or even more. We shall surely survive even without vaccinated. Covid-19 vaccine is just meant for business. We needs to be wise up especially we the Africans
1	Getting ready to get my 3rd one end of the month thank God, I feel safer with the shot as I do taking the flu shot.
1	It's fascinating to watch the progress and innovative ideas in vaccine technology
1	Full disclosure first: I had my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine on March 2 and will get the second next week, on March 23. I‚Äôm not 100% confident and worry-free about any side effects or possible danger from it; but I‚Äôm close enough to that to make my decision comfortably.

1	Thanks to vaccines, I never suffered from polio, smallpox, measles, or chickenpox when I was a child.
1	Got my first shot yep had the same experiences..good luck sweets stay well
1	I want vaccine... please. Answer
0	Pay attention to the part when they show the spike protein being attacked by your immunity, and imagine YOUR OWN CELLS being attacked as well as they include the protein on their surface, or when the protein attaches to the RECEPTORS on the cells that have them (allegedly respiratory system, TESTES, HEART, BLOOD VESSELS, PLACENTA, etc...
0	I had my life destroyed by my own family, all because I chose to remain unvaccinated. The covid cult really did bring out the worst in people.
0	the main thing to take from this is, these are the people educated about health science and they are not taking it. HUGE STATEMENT.
0	56. "I believe getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19."
1	The vaccine saved my life.  Nuff said‚Ä¶
1	Im getting one as soon as theyre cleared for the general population.
1	I respect the CDC and Dr.Fauci thank you I have all my vaccine. Thank you.
0	My friend got shot got covid
1	No one I know direct has had any sever side effects. The only one they ended up in a hospital on a ventilator was the one friend who didn't get a vaccination.
0	The only problem I have with this line of reasoning is that if 90% of the population have been vaccinated, everything is going to be disproportionately represented in the vaccinated.
1	I was suspicious of Trump pushing the first vaccines through so quickly. He is such a wild card. But with all the medical authorities lining up behind it, I went with it. Ive had all the boosters. Look forward to it being a seasonal flu shot. Not sure why other still arent taking advantage of modern medicine. but some people go years without seeing a doctor. Are they going to avoid getting the cancer vaccines that might be around the corner (within the next 10 years)?
1	Feeling confident and protected now that I've gotten my vaccine. Let's work together to end this pandemic
1	It is coming. Vaccine will be here soon! So excited...

1	I will get my vaccinations in time! I will make an appointment as soon as it is at all possible.
0	I don't want to be a guinea pig for the pharmaceutical industry.
0	wow so much hypocrisy,for whom do you guys work for besides pfizer,Bill Gates? and two shots for the efficacy of this poison??what happened to the old good vaccines that used to be one shot for life and safe and secure with minor side effects??are you guys at least scientist to claim that this experimental vaccine is safe without proper trials and tests in human beings ?

0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!!
0	We actually had many tv reports in Gernany in the last time that covered the subject of doctors not reporting side effects. I also had adverse effects which were not reported by my doctor. Doctors in Germany need to put hours into reporting this stuff without getting paid for it and so they simply just don‚Äôt report anything. Really dangerous. There are only a few doctors and clinics who deal with these people and they are getting flooded with patients at the moment who seek out help.
0	I ain't been the same since that vaccine. Stay safe out here, folks
0	Persistent lightheadedness was another side effect I experienced after getting the vaccine.
0	People are getting sick more often I've noticed these changes. People say it could be covid. Some say it could be the injections.
0	THE JABS WERE NEVER NEEDED! Africa Is Starkly Unvaccinated, And Starkly Unvanquished By COVID. This is not the first piece of evidence that Africa is leading the world away from a microbial-pretext tyranny‚Ä¶
1	I got vaccinated to protect my family and friends from COVID-19.
1	I understand the concerns some people have, but the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks for me
0	Except for clots, stroke, heart attack, and all other assorted problems caused by the vax
0	I have not been vaccinated and do not intend to be vaccinated. I have not had Covid. God knows the number of my days and I refuse to live in fear.
0	STOP the injections
0	the evidence is that those shots don‚Äôt work to protect you‚Ä¶.

0	Health officials need to sue the company, as they were forced to take these vaccines.
0	WHO deceived all people with its lies. Vaccines has no performance.

1	Got it ‚Ä¶.because I don‚Äôt want to die a horrible death in an ICU ward with a tube down my throat, machines pumping my heart and my only child unable to see be at my side when all options had been tried and failed. I couldn‚Äôt put him through that.
0	This is the new genocide, the government are killing us slowly while making huge profits
0	Is it just me or everyone is equally unexcited by the Russian Covid-19 Vaccine?
0	It‚Äôs all ridiculous. My family members who were pressuring me to get vaccinated have caught and given us all covid last week. I‚Äôm not mad at it, just accept that you believed a lie. We‚Äôre all well and we can move on.

0	This is amazing‚Ä¶ they won‚Äôt refuse healthcare for a crack head, OD‚Äôn for the 7th time.. but got forbid someone doesn‚Äôt get a bs vaccine
1	Your poor future children, if you don't get them vaccinated.
0	Should everyone get the vaccine.... No.
1	Science has always been there for us, and it's never let us down. The vaccine is a shining example of what science can do for us, and I am proud to stand with it and support it in its mission to protect our health and our world.
0	Appears freedom of choice at work! Who is against freedom choice when Pfizer tried to hide for FIFTY-YEARS the known side effects of the EXPERIMENTAL shots. Whom can blame them!
0	I'm sure my 22yo Nephew who had the forced experimental jab to stay at university, who is going for his fourth surgery on his lungs today after they both collapse straight after the jab would not have had it if he knew what the damage of the side effects are.
0	Never did, never will. No shots my whole life. I sure as heck ain‚Äôt going to start now. Almost 60.
0	Vaccine vampires ‚Ä¶ thirsting to jab us with God knows what. The pushiness turned me off too.
1	It is absolutely stunning to me the false information people believe. Just stunning. Hats off that nurses and doctors are still able to help.
1	When the lady says it was personal, it convinced me the vaccine is safe!!
1	I‚Äôm happy about pfizer and the coronavirus vaccine
0	This vaccine is part of their agenda. Nobody wants a microchip.
1	You are right. Make sure to get several boosters, it's good for you like vitamins.
0	we don't care. we don't want it.
1	When a safe vaccine is available, it is obvious that everyone should be vaccinated to protect vulnerable groups.
0	The majority still don't know, they still believe is safe and effective
1	I highly recommend getting vaccinated against COVID-19 to anyone who's eligible. It's quick, easy, and so important for our collective health
1	I had 2 sinopharm doses and by my 3rd dose: Pfizer booster I had a a very bad reaction (hyperventilation, cold sweat, shortness of breath, phlebitis on arm, adnopathies), I felt like I was gonna collapse for 2 days, despite of that, I do believe in vaccines and encourage everybody to take the boosters but I don't know why I felt so terrible!!
1	Nobody cares about ‚Äúflatten the curve‚Äù. Gov needs to shut everything down, soon. Then people have nowhere to go. Americans are too spoiled & stubborn.
1	Wearing a mask, getting the vaccine is protection for others
1	I got 3 shots, sinopharm. People all around me tested positive, but I never did.
0	A wise doctor once said: "never be first in line to get a new or experimental treatment".
0	what are the real ingredients? do we really know what we are injecting in our bodies?
0	You need to check out the newly released information of the side effects is interesting especially considering all the people that have died.
1	I hope this vaccine Wii be approved by WHO to be used world wide not only mRNA vaccine.
1	I‚Äôll be the first in line once it‚Äôs available to me.
0	covid vaccines:  professor of economics at MSU says approximately 278,000 folk died
0	It's so safe They force you to take it
1	You know the anti vaxxers portrayed in these videos are actually people who have information and they have their own opinions. They're not the crazy people who march in anti vaxx rallies based on russian conspiracies and Qanon and 'insulting my human rights' stances. These are understandable. These people have their own trauma and are not just wildly following right wing Facebook posts.
0	You can have mine. I don't plan on taking this jab. Have you seen the ingredients???
1	You need vaccines in order to make a population immune from a disease. You can do this by vaccinating 90% or more of the population. Essentially what happens is the disease dies out or at least shows reduced cases per year due to most of the population being immune to the disease. Its called "herd immunity" and it increases population survival drastically. As for you earlier comments I think you have been wrongfully educated on immune system function and how it relates to vaccines.
0	I developed Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) after getting the vaccine.
1	I‚Äôm getting the vaccine eventually when it‚Äôs my turn
1	I've subbed buddy, great video. How to drill this into the anti vaxxers is the next step!! Informative, amusing and well presented.
0	The vaccines never went through a phase 2 or three. We are here in cases of blood clots appendicitis ,death one woman got Bell‚Äôs palsy
1	Got my first jab yesterday and joined the 12 million that have had theirs
1	Every covid conspiracy theorist I‚Äôve ever met is invariably a person who‚Äôs marginalized by a lack of formal education, a sketchy record of employment, and a near complete lack of critical thinking ability.
1	The vaccine isn‚Äôt 100%; no vaccine is. But I like the odds of surviving COVID better with the vaccine than without it.
0	I'm not saying don't get it but if one isn't in an at risk group (young and lean) one might give it some thought
0	Awesome comments ! We need to stand up to this vaccine
1	I was also pretty anti-vax. But when I got Lymphoma, I started realizing that not everything can be treated naturally. Then COVID came along and it shocked me that people wouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated for a current and serious threat!
1	There are unvaccinated people in the hospital , on ventilators , who said the same thing at one time.
0	Love that the liquid in the syringe looks like poisonous acid.

0	The COVID-19 vaccines are only needed if you have a death wish.
0	2 weeks after getting boosted, my best friend has had a stroke and he's never had anything but slightly elevated BP. Its on the list.
1	A lot of people don‚Äôt understand that‚Äôs the way to get rid of these horrible viruses, creating heard immunity is the best thing that we can do. We have to vaccinate ourselves in order to protect the ones that can‚Äôt get vaccinated.
0	Shameful. Political. Dangerous.
1	Not only will you be less sick but your chance of long COVID is probably also reduced. Long COVID may turn out to be a serious health issue and may contribute to straining our hospital systems. The damage of long COVID may impact people's vascular system leading to strokes and other nasty consequences.

0	Pure blood here and barely even got sick, while people with the jab now having health problems or dropping like flies.
1	I have been taking vaccines for the FLU for decades, including this year. Never side effects. If COVID really is a FLU, then I should expect the same.
1	Congrulations to everyone who has taken the vaccine
1	At this point I‚Äôm just sitting back and letting natural selection take it‚Äôs course and wipe out the idiot anti-vaxxers. It makes me feel like a bad person that I don‚Äôt feel empathy for those who chose not to vaccinate, get Covid, and die. I wouldn‚Äôt even feel empathy for my own family. you play stupid games you win stupid prizes
0	About half my friends haven't had the vaccine and for some reason they seem to be less likely getting sick
1	LMAO does she know what mortality rate that would be? We'd be wiped out. Unreal. Also, world's overpopulated, bring it on
0	Prizes and privileges for those who take the jab, backed by relentless pro-jab propaganda. That alone is enough to make me not want this thing.
0	I mean.. go ahead and take it if you wanna be runnin around looking like an i am legend zombie.
1	So glad I got it, and I'm still afraid of a mutation coming back to kill me. After I quit one of my former coworkers got it & suffered months before getting a double lung transplant. I felt relief & guilt knowing he's probably physically & financially decimated. I did feel like trying to strong arm people into getting it was like trying to get a cat to walk with on a leash. You need people to think it's their idea & they actually might be missing out or excluded.

0	these were new vaccines that were rushed, there was very little data to share or be transparent about.
0	I think most have come to the realization that the vaccines don't work and there are better ways of managing symptoms. If you hold out the trend will shift away from bad medicine.
0	My VO2max tanked significantly after the vaccine.

0	I have taken every vaccines of various dieseases as prescribed age wise since childhood. But looking at numerous unreported side effects after vaccination in India, I am feeling tensed and skeptical about this one.
0	I'm a conspiracy theorist with no medical qualifications at all, and while Govt were last year saying we only need two jabs to solve Covid, I was predicting we would be in a worse situation AFTER they start rolling out their Vaccines.

0	The are going to implant chips into US!!
1	They love to claim someone that gets the sniffles while vaxxed is at the same risk for long covid as a vaccine-denier that was hospitalized
1	I have worked in healthcare throughout the pandemic and work directly with covid patients. Granted I did get all the vaccines, but did work in the beginning without a vaccine cause there wasn't one. I have never had covid and I get tested regularly..
0	We were lied to. They said the vaccine was the cure, but it wasn't. It was meant to kill off the rest of who didn't die from covid.
0	With every passing day, I'm happier that I rejected the vaccine. Especially after I caught covid and it was the mildest cold I ever had
0	"Vaccines don't stop people from dying from COVID-19 or catching it" Then why do both the incedence of infection and mortality decrease as vaccinated population percentages increase? It's like you know what the answer is and say the opposite ü§£ü§£ü§£.

1	My boyfriend is a polio survivor, if he had access to vaccines and could go back in time to take it he would. Side effects happen, but are often far less disruptive and dangerous to life than the actual disease. Its sad that this is even an argument.

0	Happily UNVAXXED and healthy. The jabbed are the ones getting sick all the time.

0	NO JAB HERE !!! I DO NOT LISTEN TO CULT LEADERS !!
1	You are not a hero if you die of covid and did not vaccinate yourself. You are not a hero if you drive a semi across a highway to block the workers who are doing their part
1	As always, I'll listen to the educated people in the health fields. They aren't in the business of killing off the population with a vaccine.
0	The UK‚Äôs statistics regulator recently admitted that the official COVID-19 vaccine data is biased. The data which has widely been used to support claims that the vaccine is effective, underrepresents the number of unvaccinated people. NTD spoke to professor Norman Fenton

1	Great! Thanks to vaccines, Australians are now quite safe from COVID-19.

0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
0	I and my whole family of 7, including 2 people over 80, also a few of my friends were tested positive. It was just like a normal cold we‚Äôve had in previous years for all of us. However I personally know people who already have v side effects. None of us got the v nor ever will
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.

0	Say a vaccine causes a few deaths, obviously that's less detrimental than the damage COVID is causing. But what if it creates severe disabilities in millions of people?
0	Doctors warn the world to stop taking the Covid Vaccines, they are toxic, lethal, ineffective and must be stopped. They damage the brain, heart, liver, bone marrow, fetus, causing all sorts of harm in the body. CDC, FDA misinformation causing death and injury !

0	I had a heart attack after my jab. I'm young fit don't drink or smoke but that wasn't enough after my jab.
1	It looks like those statistics are for the original variant. In theory mRNA vaccines provide spectrum protection against specific variants. Due to antigenic original, even if new variant-specific booster shots are developed, the booster shots will most likely provide poor protection.
0	I had tested positive before vaccination and felt a below-average cold when I tested negative said to myself is that it? funny you still can get infected even when vaccinated.

1	Vaccination is a way to restore confidence in our daily lives and activities.
1	Got Moderna here. First shot: the injection itself was only like an ant's bite. Twenty minutes later, I felt like I've been punched by an Olympic boxer in the arm. Two days later, it's gone. I feel like I need to mentally prepare for the second shot next month.
1	As the vaccine become available, be prepared to see a lot more anti-vaxx posts and shares. Be careful to ensure your information comes from a credible website. It‚Äôs normal to be worried but vaccination is the only way out of this
0	Only the brightest and boldest like you have wisdom and courage to call this out. Misplaced obedience and compliance of fearful, unquestioning  physicians and patients with government,corporate manipulation is deadly. Doctors step up!Lead!
1	That block from secondary school education is seriously annoying. He is a qualified doctor
1	Got the covid shot in one arm, and the flu shot in the other a few weeks back at the same time. I'm ready for the holidays.
0	We still have a problem, that is, how long has this study took? Because if it haven't had enough time, these numbers could change. Like 3 months later, the Vaccinated group could catch COVID19 and these numbers changes and the 95% of efficacy could decrease.
1	Got my second vaccine! I'm perfectly fine guys, it's not that seroius!
0	Unfortunately I fell out with a friend of mine last Christmas. He is quite a celebrated consultant surgeon. He discovered I was unvaccinated on a night out and essentially called me stupid. I said I want to know the numbers of heart attacks and strokes in 2019, 2020 and 2021. He would not accept my assertion that people were dying from this. Anyway, I am sad to lose a friend, but pretty disgusted that a builder seems to know more than a highly trained doctor. Pretty pathetic really.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	You have to understand that the same people that own the pharmaceutical industry own the broadcast and traditional print media as they also fund organisations that monitor these business sectors.. it is only through platforms like these that information can be broadcast albeit through vigilantly controlled goal posts! Without your hard work DR John we would be in the dark regarding many realities around covid and vaccination.. thank you sir!
0	NY putting illegal migrant children in school with zero vaccines.
0	Dr. Malone, mRNA inventor says it is dangerous. This was known long before they were released and the cdc wouldn‚Äôt allow any treatments so they would have an excuse for the emergency use of the clot shots and the cdc benefits since they use their patents.
1	I have been fully vaccinated with the Oxford University/Astrazenica Vaccine and I'm in the Category "Medically extremely Vulnerable" due to my already existing health condition! Except for a little bit of a sore Arm and a bit of a fever, I have had absolutely no other side effects from neither one or the other shot of the 2! I really think the Vaccine saved my life, as my husband caught Covid 19 in Hospital and came back home still positive!
1	Yes. My whole household will. We'd be stupid and inconsiderate not to
0	Did you guys drop dead yet?
0	So help us fight against experimental injections and get justice!!!!
1	The only solution to the pandemic, vaccines!
0	Remember that one time 80's - 90's when people died from AIDS treatment (AZT) and not actual AIDS virus? Remember that one doctor who promoted that treatment?
1	I had astrazenika without any side effects at all.
1	Grateful for the vaccine and all the hardworking scientists and healthcare workers who made it possible
1	Smart people with Ôøºcritical thinking skills follow the science rather than any opinion based on politics!
1	PFIZER GANG
0	HERES A QUESTION FOR THE INTERVIEWER WHY ARE VACCINE MAKERS IMMUNE TO PROSECUTION ?
0	De Santis has shown real leadership on this issue. My son was in the ER after a booster last Dec and it‚Äôs become clear that there is a major cover up going on in the media, internet and government. I appreciate De Santis courage and integrity taking on this critical issue.
0	I won‚Äôt be satisfied until lord fauchi writes me a check for bankrupting my small business.
0	I‚Äôm not getting it unless it is forced upon me. I don‚Äôt know whether the school will do that or not.
0	It was a plan-demic! Jokes on us suckers!
1	I am very glad I decided to get vaccinated
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
0	I'm 42 and I admit I'm not the healthiest but  I refused to be vaccinated against covid. Out of my family of 4 and my husbands extended family of 10.....out of the 14 people I am the only non vaccinated person and  I am also the only person to have never tested positive for covid. My husband and both daughters were really quite poorly with omicron and my eldest had a different variant a year earlier and she has had all her boosters. I will not be having the vaccine despite the fact my gp keeps offering me it along with the flu jab ( everytime I had flu jab I ended up on antibiotics for a chest infection for 3 months so I won't have that one either)
1	Judy Mikovits was jailed for 5 days because she stole lab data from her former employer. She never worked with Dr. Fauci, contradicting her own words in a recent interview. COVID-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives and prevented hospitalizations. #VaccineWork
1	Just got the first shot of moderna. Arm hurts, hope I won't have any other symptoms! I have severe anxiety and was so scared of the needle and jab itself but I didn't even feel a thing. I'm so lucky to have gotten moderna so early on in the general vaccination process.
0	I am 65+ CORONA age target, come get me asshole virus, bring help
0	28. "I trust the experts who have said the vaccine is safe, I got my shot."
0	It causes cancer and infertility.
1	The vaccine was not hard to schedule and not much information was needed and of course it was free. I really hope others get the vaccine so we can get back to normal soon.
0	I didn‚Äôt have any booster vaccines, it‚Äôs horrifying.
0	I took two shots for Moderno. I‚Äôve had high blood pressure never had it before that
1	I mean teens here CANNOT get the COVID vaccine with whacky antivax parents unfortunately
0	Yup, bill gates said he wants to kill 20% of the world population with vaccines. All the sick fucks in the crowd clapped, 10 years later here we are
0	My coworker passed away one week after the jab. Just a coincidence I'm sure.
0	This data is fraudulently manipulated. They used different time periods and counted the same people as both unvaxxed and vaxxed before and after the vax. If you adjust for proper cohorts, the vaccinated death rate per day is 2% higher than unvaxxed.
1	It's heart-wrenching to see the toll COVID-19 has taken on our communities. By getting vaccinated, we have the power to protect ourselves and those around us. Don't waste this opportunity
0	The latest bivalent was tested on six mice and zero humans. Take it if you want. I won't.
0	The Covid vaccines cost rather than save lives.
0	Stop testing and dont take the vaxine.
0	I am appalled at what my government is doing. What has happened to the Hippocratic oath that all doctors take on qualifying: First, Do No Harm (Primum, Non Nocere).
1	My mom felt the same way until she was in a coma for two months fighting for her life. First thing she said we she came out of it was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting the shot‚Äù.
0	All of us who have had a v, now have weaker immune systems. Today I had to sit down twice as my heart was pounding .... one very scary and it took a while for my heart to calm down.
1	Thanks to everyone doing their civic duty and getting vaccinated. Things have been opening up for everyone to enjoy mostly thanks to you who are willing to make some personal sacrifices
0	Is the vaccine a new scheme by the Government to brainwash our mind?
1	Too many emotions to write about. Flooded with memory of patients I fought for but lost. Grateful to the scientists and volunteers who made this possible. Now let‚Äôs get everyone vaccinated!
0	Me and my parents are unvaccinated and still here completely healthy
0	I don't want to risk my child's health for something that may not even work.
0	I've been thinking about that, so far I've escaped the infection and my problem is that I'm allergic to the usual flu vaccines.So I won't be vaccinated
0	Another war criminal who just told us they intend to kill millions more with more death vaccines
1	To those who don't understand these 3 minutes, here's the simple summary: mRNA is great.
1	i'm more than excited to get vaccinated! and because of this video, i'm more than determined to share this towards my family and friends. kudos to the team behind this video!
1	I just got my first shot this week and I am so utterly grateful for it.
0	Conspiracy theories can be so dangerous and it's great to have a source of accurate information. This video was a lifesaver for me and helped me separate fact from fiction.
1	Being a sick for a couple of days after a vaccine is not a ‚Äúmajor side effect‚Äù. The Rasmussen poll is misrepresentative.
1	Just like they are trying to say the vaccine caused damar hamlins cardiac arrest! Morons!
1	All of it is sad. But I appreciate you being vaxxed and doing your part. I just got my third booster bc Im an organ transplant recipient and they said for us to get the booster. :)
1	Taking the vaccine protects all of us!
0	I'm not against vaccines, but I believe we should have the right to choose what goes into our bodies. Mandatory vaccines go against our individual freedom.
1	Thank u so much sir for ur kind information....next Monday I am going take covid 19 vaccine.
1	I had a kid in my Environmental Science class who was skeptical about the vaccine on the basis that it could modify DNA.  I laughed my ass off about when I was out of earshot because we had, literally the day before that, in our AP Bio Class learnt about how mRNA works.  We were literally handed the information about what mRNA, in a vaccine or otherwise, does, and she either didn't understand it, or failed to connect the easiest two dots in the world to connect.
0	This is exactly why I've been sceptical about this vaccination getting into the market after 1 year. There hasn't been enough testing.
0	Whose earned a lot of money from compulsory vaccination love Pfizer!
1	Get your kids #vaccinated &amp; #boosted against #COVID19. Find vaccine near you here: https://t.co/5oPdHshPeM. #MedTwitter #Pediatrics https://t.co/hqgzZjfH4Y
0	‚ÄúThe vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense.‚Äù
1	It's a pity that so many people know nothing about the history of plagues/pandemic and the developing of vaccines to fight them. Because of vaccines and the understanding of many diseases, they were eradicated. Now new variations have arisen and we start again. Its learning from history and the evolution of circumstances that create viruses that have to be addressed. It's an everchanging challenge. Insects and animals can carry diseases that can infect humans. We learned about that centuries ago.
0	Never trust the gov!
0	Non of us regret not taking it
0	Not for me thanks. Ask me about my recent visit to the Veterans Administration for my annual checkup.
1	So grateful to have access to a vaccine that helps protect me and my loved ones from COVID-19
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
0	They wanted us ALL filled with this dangerous trash, never forget
0	The Covid-19 vaccine can be dangerous and deadly.
0	Gates is so full of it. What a scam.
1	I love how all pro-vaccine videos on this channel are raided by anti-vaxx activists. But other videos not based on science any more credible than pro-vaccine once are not objectionable to them at all. How is that not doublethink?
1	Slow the spread!
0	The government and the pharmas struck a non liability/prosecution deal for ANY adverse consequences. If vaccines are safe, why should they do it? Lack of trust on their own product? Knowledge that is damaging? What is being hidden?
1	If everyone could just get their vaccine we could finally go outside again. Do you really like isolation that much?
1	We all need it quick before it's too late
0	Can someone please explain to me what the purpose of getting new COVID shots when the virus is a). Mutating so quickly as to largely negate the effects of vaccines that take months to develop b). Not as deadly as previous iterations of the virus?
1	I just got a booster 3 weeks ago and went to a wedding where my wife and daughter got covid. I never got it.
0	I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs extremely rare. 2 very close male friends were diagnosed with GBS about 3 months apart & within 7 days of their 3rd booster.
0	Thank you Sir for sharing your wisdom and humor while informing people! From the onset of this pandemic I felt something was wrong before the so called vaccines were made available (sometimes you smell the shit before it hits the fan). I resisted and refused the vaccines from day one. Even my dad insisted but to no avail. Always hold your position, follow your instinct and people such as Dr Campbell. You are doing a remarkable work here.
0	You couldn't pay me to get that vaxx, so as long as I stay away it costs nothing to no one
1	The college I work for is offering Covid vaccines for all employees. It‚Äôs crazy to think people are trying so hard to get it and I‚Äôm about to get it with no effort put in on my part. I‚Äôm truly blessed
1	This is actually good news! With the upcoming price hikes for Moderna vaccines it's a relief that data is showing that the initial vaccine & booster has proven to be durable enough that younger working-age aren't being hospitalized in great enough numbers to warrant future shots. It shows that at least for these omicron variants, the worst of covid's effects is dissipating for non-seniors. I'm just hoping that in the near future hybrid immunity will provide some buffer to dampen any surges caused by newer omicron mutations. Even those who're healthy don't want to suffer through flu-like symptoms & migraine-like throbbing more than once a year.
0	Hii Doctor, Am also facing ED after vaccination.. Its not bcoz of covid19, its bcoz of covaxin vaccine.. You can check with pre and post vaccination of covid patient.. Am very upset now.. Before vaccination i was getting 100% erection but now after one month also its not getting erected.. Pls help Doctor...  Top most doctors are not ready to accept this that due to vaccine peoples are facing ED.. then why there are so many videos uploaded on YT., peoples are facing it.. But government and DR are ignoring it..
0	We were all taught peer pressure was bad in school, I guess it's okay when the government is doing the pressuring. Just say no!
1	Lots of people want to piss on this technology, but in reality it is very simple process. Its future to treat this and other illnesses is going to be amazing.
1	It's reasonable to ask how we know that these vaccines are safe, or how sure we are that there are no long-term side effects. But any reasonable investigation into these questions should yield a conclusion that whatever possible side effects might be caused by this vaccine they are absolutely dwarfed by the risks of contracting COVID-19. No matter your age or other health risks
0	Pfizer love injecting you
1	did you guys know you can get vaccinated against covid-19 for free
1	Don't let anti-vaxxers spread misinformation, get vaccinated and protect your health.
1	Even Trump already said it's safe, though
1	I've gotten my primary series and 2 boosters. Do I need another booster?
1	About time you assholes take it seriously. Get vaccinated.
0	Around a third of respondents to a six-country survey by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism reported that they had seen ‚Äúa lot or a great deal of false or misleading‚Äù information about COVID-19 on social media during the previous week.
1	At least pre omicron it was fairly clear the vaccine protected against hospitalization and death but effects were small below a certain age or health profile.
1	People like this need to be sent back in time before antibiotics and vaccinations to really see the true horror of disease.
1	Vaccines save lives by protecting against serious and deadly diseases.
0	What an incredibly brave doctor! He's brought hope to thousands of people like me not wanting to be forced to be vaccinated
0	Who cares? I'm not having another shot.
0	China will buy companies at cheap prices, soon it will declare vaccines are created and will hold world at bargain. BioWar is ON
1	American parents will let their children die of Covid rather than getting them a vaccine,their childs need these!!!
1	The entire vaccine hesitency reminds me of my sister-in-law. She was an incredible flake. At one point she refused to use elevators because she read somewhere that there were elevator accidents, she used stairs all the time, even in taller buildings. What she didn't consider, however, was that the accident potential in using stairs was far higher that that using elevators.  So it is with Covid and vaccinations. The risk of serious illness or death from vaccinations is far lower than that from catching Covid and being unvaccinated. It seems like such people view the risk of death as 50%, either you die or you don't.
0	Still not #vaccinated.
0	We are seeing the effects of the poison you've coerced people to take all over live television.
0	This Vaccine no matter its version or number must be pulled. 20 deaths would have had any vaccine pulled. Now over a million dead? "Com on man". #DJT #ElonMusk #Biden #McCarthy #ChineseBallon #Veritas #Covid #DeathShot #CovidVaccines #Pfizer
0	How about just put them where they belong right in the garbage or inject them into your own body‚Äôs you bunch of criminals with the crimes you have committed against humanity with this lethal injection and past lethal injections if no vaccine prevents infection or transmission there‚Äôs no point of them period especially if they are so safe big pharma wouldn‚Äôt need indemnity
1	Imagine being scared of a damn needle! My 12 year old daughter took it like a boss!
1	I'm proud that I got an old friend to get the vaccine. He was a bit paranoid about it. When I told him I'd feel terrible if someone found him dead in his home. He's about 75ish
1	I'll take it after the folks who need it first get it (health care workers, the elderly, etc). I get being skeptical, but imma trust science on this one.
0	Power to the purebloods
0	Definitely prevents COVID more than the COVID vaccines.lmao
0	The government fought against effective treatments in favor of the vaccine. That‚Äôs criminal.
0	They fired all those that refused to push medication they had no idea were safe, and all those that did, are still there.
0	The #polio vaccine is causing the new polio! Yes, the #vaccines are causing the #problem.
1	I'm thinking if I take all three vaccines I'll be safe.
1	Everyone was able to get the second shot - everyone should have 4 shots of mRNA vaccine by now. And I really can‚Äôt wait for everyone to get the new booster with their fall influenza annual vax. And everyone over the age of 6 months should have gotten their basic shots by now, for both themselves and their community.
0	My 84yo MIL easily survived covid in early December 2020. She received a Moderna shot at the end of January 2021. She immediately started feeling ill and developed multiple organ failure. She was put in hospice. While in hospice, they administered her second dose. She died on March 1, less than 4 days later. Her case was reported to VAERS.
0	SAY NO TO COVID-19 VACCINES Get your covid-19 Digital QR certificate or PAPER CARD, BOOSTERS, AND EXEMPTION LETTERS without taking the vaccine.
1	Getting vaccinated has given me a sense of control and responsibility in the face of this pandemic
1	I‚Äôm not against getting the vaccine , I feel you have the right to choose ! What I am against is the government mandating it and forcing it on everyone
0	Should Dr. Fauci be held responsible for all COVID vaccine injuries?
0	WTF! #Vaccinated people have to take #AIDS test? If you have an AIDS, just don't take #AZT.  Glad I didn't vaccinated, I'm also AIDS free thenü•¥ https://t.co/swVlG2k67n
0	My grandmother got very sick right after her second booster. She had some COVID symptoms, but no COVID. She died 2 months later in a lot of pain. My sibling also experienced some neurological side effects. I have not experienced any side effects, but I'm now hesitant to get a 2nd booster. I feel we are not getting told the full story when it comes to risk.
0	my cousin posted a video of them getting the vaccine shot and the needle didn‚Äôt come out?    kinda sus
0	Regarding free will, people quietly exercise it to decline flu vaccines every year. The difference with Covid is that the vax-obsessed would take away that right.
1	Covid vaccines saved a ton of lives. They are less effective than they were but they were but they still save lives.
0	New paper published in BMJ shows Covid vaccine causes 5x more myocarditis than Covid itself (Vax:530 vs Covid:109). For young people the risk is 10x higher (Vax:202 vs Covid:19)
0	Safety first. Hence my recommendation: Refresh vaccination damage now!
1	Dumb s@%t antivaxers say: "Why should children get vaccinated? Kids don't die from COVID-19" How about because COVID-19 is one of the top 10 killers of children in certain age groups...
1	Keep on fighting the good fight because science wins! Science is truth!
0	21 family members attended a family celebration in July. 15 of the 21 got Covid while we were on Vacation. 85% of them that got Covid were vaccinated. And the superspreader was vaccinated.
1	We already have two vaccines in only 10 months!!!  This is the most amazing scientific achievement in my lifetime.  And I watched the moon landing in school https://t.co/Y9cSUZiF7t
1	Sniffle It‚Äôs hard for me to think of a future where we don‚Äôt have the right to spread highly preventable diseases. What are these people thinking?
1	Absence from work at record high as Americans feel strain from Covid https://t.co/kDwVopsuti Can you imagine what #America would be like if no one got #vaccinated?  Millions more would be dead. #CovidIsNotOver #COVID19 #Jobs #antivaxxers #VaccinesWork #healthcare #COVIDVACCINE
1	See, I don't know ANY vaccinated people who have "died suddenly." But I know of quite a few unvaccinated people who have died from Covid.
1	I'm waiting for the news story where someone gets bitten by an animal, refuses the rabies vaccine, and dies.
0	Who should not take the covid vaccine? Answer: everyone
1	I was also grateful to know my shot helped protect my newborn through my milk.
1	It‚Äôs amazing, and should be something we are all excited about. A HUGE advancement in the medical field and will change the future of vaccines. It‚Äôs a shame partisanship and drama is putting a damper on that.
1	COVID vaccines have saved millions of lives. In the US alone, hundreds of thousands of skeptics died unnecessarily.
0	Thanks but no thanks. And I'd ask the WHO to consider what kind of road it's going down when its forcing medical proceedures on people or taking away their human rights.
1	The Covid-19 vaccin is like a seatbelt. It doesn't mean you can't get involved in a car crash, it just mean it saves you from crushing your head on the steering wheel or flying tru the windshield.
1	Covishield the Panacea of Covid19...Big Thanks to serum Institute team member's for their Hard work... Your Toil and  dedication to the work needs to be praiseworthy... Thnku once again and keep it up....üáÆüá≥üí™

0	Very clear ,forwarded here in the Netherlands to colleagues and friends,am a nurse myself ,unvaccinated
0	DONT TRUST THE GOVERNMENT. THE VACCINE DOES NOT WORK
1	Getting vaccinated is a personal choice, but it's also a public responsibility.
0	Maybe his employer told him to get jabbed. After all CNN worked for the deep state and big pharma and pushed the jab a lot like all MSM. The pilot‚Äôs company might be complicit in his murder.
0	63% of nhs staff have refused the winter booster clot shot , tells you how safe they think it is
0	I feel so scared for all the people who took the vaccine. Prayer for them and their Future and especially the children's future for years to come.
1	Wonder how many in the comments are no longer with us?
0	These pharmaceutical companies will never complete enough research to admit wrongdoing.
0	I‚Äôm not at all curious about it. I don‚Äôt take vaccines for viruses with 99.8% survival rate. Stop lying CNN.
0	WHY are we injecting our children with experimental drugs when they are at statistical ZERO risk from covid?
1	I am happy that I live in Denmark where approximately 90% of adults are vaccinated, and we are back to our normal lifes! No restrictions anymore!
0	At least 594 doctors have died in the second wave of Covid-19 in the country so far. As they were Doctors so all of them took both the doses of vaccine.   So why did they die? Know one knows. Everybody have their diffrent and own opinion, but nothing proved.
0	27. "I think it's important to protect yourself and others, I got the vaccine."
0	Did anyone tell them that Omicron isn't dangerous?
0	The quackvax and it's 'boosters' all compromise the immune system, even more than being unhealthy or elderly. Purebloods will inherit the earth.
1	Thanks so much. I should shortly be offered a vaccine but may get a choice if I wait longer but now feel reassured that all the vaccines are effective
1	That god for Biontech and science.
0	Although they've clearly tried to add in the few individuals with the intention of making them look stupid, they've done the exact opposite. Simply not wanting to do something because you don't want to is perfectly valid. Consent is a think that matters in all aspects of life. People shouldn't have to justify their personal decision for their own body.
0	I think you mean the Covid vax has damaged more lives than any other vaccine in history. There fixed it for you!
1	Can you imagine if that happened and anti-vaxxers ended up being the only people left in the world‚Ä¶
0	A vaccine for a virus that has a death rate of 1%? I‚Äôll take my chances.
1	I am immunocompromised, so I'm slightly more fearful of the virus than the vaccine and will take my chances with the latter. My body, my choice, right?
1	Im so glad I took the vaccine, but the nurses technique made me shiver
0	From the industry that brought you Thalidomide. You can trust us they said, it's fine they said....
1	Yeah everyone in my family is fully vaccinated and my friends and their kids, non have got COVID or died or had any related incidents.
0	It's not game over for vaccines. Wishful thinking. People still listen to the media. The media still says people are dying of covid, get boosted. Until that narrative changes big pharm won't be stopped. Big pharm is the media. DNC =media=pharm Congress = pharm stocks/shares
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
0	Covid vaccine did that not covid. Everybody knows that the vaccine has harmful side effects. Stop trying to change history. Millions of people were poisoned and more side effects of the vaccine will come to light over time.
1	I got the Pfizer vaccine because I‚Äôm a somewhat decent person who cares about others around me.
1	Claustrophobics don't yell "Stay out of elevators! You'll die!" Why can't you keep your phobia to yourselves and not be so damn obnoxious?
1	Getting vaccinated shows your unconditional love that you have for other people.
1	Vaccine is like safe driving, everyone should do it.
1	just tested positive today, it‚Äôs terrible. please continue to wear your masks and get vaccinated
1	Why is everyone being antivaxxers now???
0	See why half of Americans won't trust a vaccine?? #CovidVaccine   After admitting mistake, AstraZeneca faces difficult questions about its coronavirus vaccine https://t.co/xkKij6MrXi
0	Thanks to Covid we now know vaccines are useless against viruses and do more harm than good
0	‚ÄúWe were lied to!‚Äù Technically yes, but what‚Äôs even more egregious is that you fell for it. I‚Äôm no Harvard graduate myself but I do know enough not to hop in line for a vax that‚Äôs only been publicly available for 5 seconds.
0	The claims of efficacy and safety about these shots did not age very well
1	Although smaller in overall size, anti-vaccination clusters manage to become highly entangled with undecided clusters in the main online network, whereas pro-vaccination clusters are more peripheral.
0	biggest scams;1. Fiat currency2. Space travel 3.Covid vaccine
0	Yeah man, go ahead and tell me after how many shots you'll be immune to Covid. Maybe the 15th will be the one.

1	Vaccines have saved countless lives and are one of the most effective ways to protect ourselves and our communities from serious diseases.
0	I regret getting my two shots
0	I know 3 ppl that died of covid 19 and they were all vaccinated. I know another 2 ppl that died of the vaccine. Repeat that again.
1	while breakthrough infections can happen, they are less likely than among the unvaccinated.
0	Anybody else's YouTube channel filling up with trust us and get the vaccine commentary?
1	The vaccines prevent serious illness, reducing death and strain on hospitals. Look at COVID death rates among vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations. You'll see it's true. But milder symptoms and quicker recovery do mean less of a a window for transmission
0	@GregHuntMP Show me the evidence that Covid19 has been isolated. If it hasn't, as I suspect is the case, then the vaccine will be useless.
1	If you are vaccinated and if many people are vaccinated, we can stop the pandemic.
0	Hats off to those who haven't allowed themselves, or their families, fall victim to the psychopaths behind the plandemic, and their needles.

1	I got vaccinated in the hospital down the street. I got the mederna vaccine! Two shots!
0	As if the unvaxxed are a problem when it's the vaxxed running around infecting people. Better off not getting it
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why  anyone would  give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually.
1	This is so interesting! I got 2 doses of moderna buuut now they've stopped vaccinating people below 30 with moderna here in Sweden due to some complications. And i really wanna know if I'll get moderna or Pfizer as a third dose, looking at this it seems to be really good either way and I'm kinda happy i did get moderna anyways
0	My grandpa died from heart attack from the vaccine. That reason alone is more than enough to not get it for me.
1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs the luck of the draw.
0	People have been injured from these vaccines. I will always remember that.
0	The young lady is üíØ right!  I have also been trying to warn people, esp those close to me not to take this dangerous jab. No easy feat but any lives saved is worth the backlash & verbal abuse I experienced üôè‚ù§
1	Take Vaccine, mRNA vaccines available in the US are highly effective against severe COVID-19
1	Just got the second dose a few days ago!!! Cmon Earth, we can do it!
1	I will take the vaccine as soon as it is offered to me.The scientists who have developed these vaccines know what they're doing. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are very similar to other vaccines that have been trialled for at least the past decade and so far there have been no adverse reactions to any of them.
0	My health was damaged by Pfizer VAX as well, my wife is nearly unable to walk.
1	Getting the COVID vaccine gave me peace of mind and protection for myself and those around me.
1	I got vaccinated to set an example for others and encourage them to do the same.
1	I'm so envious that you have the COVID Vaccine! Here in Australia we haven't gained access to it yet, here's hoping it is soon!
1	I feel confident and secure knowing that I've gotten vaccinated.
0	When the truth comes out, you can‚Äôt unvaccinate yourself.
1	We couldn't hug her but we could clap, and everybody did so in the room
1	GET VAXED
0	Should have been done a long time ago. So thank you to those who actually are interested in the truth, asking for an investigation, instead of accepting blindly what ever being told by certain organisation's, as truth, which it is not.
0	Nothing says 'Trust The Science" quite like "You can't sue us if something goes wrong" and "We need 55 years to release the data to the public"
1	Avoided it for 2.5 years and now it's my turn. Like a flu, coughing and fever. Know 3 others who got it the past week. Found out using a self test, otherwise I would just think it was another fever. Sadly we arent counting cases here in Sweden anymore among the public.
1	‚ÄúYeah but a guy who isn‚Äôt a doctor or medical researcher said it would work!!‚Äù
1	I hope everyone is having a good weekend! Science threads will resume on Monday. In the meantime, be sure to check out my most recent threads on PEER-REVIEWED COVID bivalent booster data, all about XBB/XBB.1/XBB1.5, how vaccines work, and other helpful threads. Thank you!
1	man i wish my mom wasn‚Äôt an insane anti-vaxxer i‚Äôm suffering here guys help me
1	I still live with my parents, my mom is a pretty high risk group and I need to travel a lot in public transport to go to my university. Taking the vaccine is my most logical choice.
1	Just got my second dose and I feel so grateful to have access to this life-saving vaccine
0	No I didn‚Äôt take the Covid vaccines. An experiment requires a control group.
1	Good for you getting vaccinated, hope you're feeling better tomorrow
0	Everyone that I know who has personally taken the vaccine has ended ill in one sort of way or the other. Majority if them contracting covid after the vaccine. Just my experience with the people who I am around. I have not gotten the vaccine and me myself have not gotten sick.
1	I don‚Äôt care who you are, likening vaccination to the Holocaust is sick and unacceptable.
0	I‚Äôm not an anti-vaxxer or whatever you call it, but I just don‚Äôt know enough about this one, it‚Äôs so new and makes my anxiety sky rocket
0	I‚Äôm pretty positive there is brainwashing going on. Besides the propaganda from the media I‚Äôve felt like the vaxxed are increasingly aggressive to get others to join them. It almost feels like they‚Äôre being told to recruit? Idk but I have friends who said they wouldn‚Äôt get it and a week later they got it and are telling me to do it too after we all agreed it was strange how they were pushing it. It‚Äôs very weird and it often also makes me feel like I‚Äôm in an alternate reality myself. As for your boyfriend, they‚Äôve been told this is what will ‚Äúfix‚Äù things so they want everyone to comply so things will go back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to the point where they delude themselves into thinking they‚Äôre protected when that‚Äôs clearly not the case
0	I have zero confidence in COVID vaccines
0	Now this is what I call CNN grade misinformation.
0	I guess they can say it is over now, they got enough people to get the jab and boosters now it just a matter of time when people just drop like flies!!
0	18."I believe the COVID vaccine is crucial for ending the pandemic. I want to do my part in stopping the spread of the virus."
0	No, as I have had Covid and recovered thus I am protected by natural antibodies. I will discuss the Covid vaccine with my Doctor this fall when I get my flu shot, but there is a good chance the Wuhan virus will have ran its course by then
0	Injecting this poison left me with bad back pain
1	And my heart goes out, to everyone who isn't feeling very sorry. I hope you all live a long and vaccinated life.
1	I got vaccinated to help achieve herd immunity and protect society as a whole
1	Grandma get the vaccine as a few side effects beat dying for sure
0	As much as $989 million could accrue to Facebook and Instagram alone, largely from advertising targeting the 38¬∑7 million followers of anti-vaccination accounts.
0	If you take 10 million people and simply wave your hand back and forth over their upper arms, you should predict 4,000 heart attacks in the next two months. Approximately 4,000 strokes.
0	These pharmaceutical companies and government labs are gonna kill off the human race. Like a zombie movie.
1	I don't trust the COVID vaccine. I'd rather take my chances without it.
1	COVID took a whole lot from me but I am very fortunate to be alive and vaccinated...I sure want nothing to do with intensified effects and for those that cannot receive the vaccine... Don't hold your breath counting on herd immunity
0	Yet another celebrity who publicly praised the vaccine... and then died.
0	give it up, we all know they don't work
1	I didn't take vaccine but have heard from two hospital sources that most people dying from covid didn't have the vaccine...anyone else?
1	You sure pack a lot of info into 12 ¬Ω minutes.  I‚Äôve been the self-appointed mRNA apologist to my vaccine-hesitant friends ‚Äì those who are willing to discuss it.  There is much in your vid to process.  Thanks!
1	#UAE üá¶üá™ is leading in providing solutions, capabilities, and capacities to help the world get through this global #pandemic by sending by the end of 2021 more than 18 billion doses of the #COVID19 vaccine to the world üôè https://t.co/0YLn6067S9
1	People are still dying because they refused to get vaccinated‚Ä¶
0	With the 4th booster coming up, this buggy nano OS needs more upgrades than the 1st version of windows
1	My son benefitted from herd immunity. He could not take the whooping cough vaccine when he was a kid due to a seizure disorder, but he was able to go to school & thrive due to herd immunity.
0	Hhahahahaha, its all about money!!!
1	When the polio miracle came out in the mid 60s, a dose on a sugar cube, churches were a major conduit to get the medicine out as quickly as possible. I also remember going though measles, mumps and chicken pox as well. The fact that I did not have to watch my son go through what I did, growing up, is a blessing only those who experienced it would fully understand.
1	Vaccines protect the world.
1	As a mom of a preschooler, this is bittersweet- it‚Äôs too late to protect children during omicron surge but better late than never
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
1	Yeah I've always thought of South America as being very well vaccinated and a good model for distribution programs to follow.
0	It‚Äôs sad that another pilot was MURDERED by the deep state‚Äôsüíâ
1	Too bad they didn't break out the leeches in time.
0	So magically after a vaccine is apparently found there is a ‚Äúnew strain‚Äù something far bigger is going on at work here https://t.co/shKv6mYyOI
0	I‚Äôll shout from the rooftops that I‚Äôm unvaccinated‚Ä¶. They‚Äôll also clearly see me armed to the teeth!
1	The vaccine is amazing
0	Vaccines are killing people. Lord Jesus Christ save us.
1	Vaccines are saving lives
0	Vaccine mandates violate bodily autonomy
0	My mothers best friend started having heart complications after the shot. I pray she gets better everyday.
0	Because they wouldn't promise that any blood I might require would be unvaccinated, I declined to have a heart operation to close a 13mm hole.
0	Vaccine stupidity! I think more people have died after taking the jab
1	"I believe facebook memes over scientists and healthcare professionals".... - Modern day Republicans
1	Very nice explainer, just a couple of points of information, 1st) the body can also build up an immune response to the lipposome carrier for the mRNA vaccines so the drawback mentioned for the inactivated viral carrier is actually relevant for both groups of vaccines.
0	It's weird how liberals were so angry about covid deaths but ain't saying shit about the vaccine deaths.
0	Individuals should not be required to get a vaccine that they are not comfortable with
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
0	Apparently covid vaccine gives you a bluetooth signal
0	If scientists are so confident that their vaccines are safe, why is there no liability
1	We need the CDC and the Biden Administration to stand together and increase taxes for anti vaxxers and shut their utilities off for failure to comply.  Only way we can end this virus. (Which Trump downplayed and is responsible for)
1	I just can't wait to receive my vaccine.
0	You lost me at 'Vaccines Work'!
0	I keep feeling really cold when I'm outside. Stupid vaccine injuries.
0	Next up: "We didn't force anyone. Taking the vaccine was always your choice."
1	Thanks Dr Seheult.¬† I think compliance would be a whole lot better if we implemented a baseline quantitative antibody level test.¬† If we could determine what the minimum immunity level would be based on scientific studies and used that as the "magic number" by which to recommend vaccination. It's a reasonable and logical approach that we already use for other infectious diseases, but somehow have been ignoring with Covid19.¬† Any comments on this idea??
1	COVID-19 vaccination is an important milestone in the fight against the pandemic.
0	The #video everyone should watch to know how toxic #vaccines are damaging your #health
0	Suddenly all the conservative states that haven't been following any kind of mandates or restrictions start freaking out... I thought they moved past this years ago? Fox always loves selling the hype
0	The jig is up no one believes you any more.
1	26."I'm not sure if I want to get the COVID vaccine. I need more information and I want to hear from more people who have taken it."
0	It‚Äôs a population control tactic! Don't let the corporations enslave you
1	Vaccination gives us hope and a path towards defeating this pandemic #endcovid
1	Just like my mother did with us kids, she would have us vaccinated, but would do it one at a time so it wouldn‚Äôt be overwhelming for us little kids and would know exactly which vaccine it was if we ever got a reaction to it. I did the same with my daughter and will do the same with my son, I feel like it‚Äôs smarter that way and less painful for the child.
1	Make sure you are up to date on your booster shots!
0	I'm so happy to see all these people resist this poison
1	Vaccination helps protect those who are unable to get vaccinated and provides a safer environment for everyone
0	This is sick how they want to try to manipulate you to get the shot
0	Thank you for realizing that the vaccine is complete garbage. Sorry to you and your family but hopefully now you know not to put that posion in your body. I'm Vax free and maskless since day one. I've never participated in their fear mongering. My immune system is a beautiful thing :).
1	had a bad reaction to a vaccine. My parents didn‚Äôt want me to have vaccinations since I was 2. I am now 19 and went to get vaccines due to going into nursing. They told me if I had any worries they would work with an allergist to make sure I wouldn‚Äôt have a reaction. Simply talk to your doctor instead of believing they are secretly harming you.
1	GoFundMe... more like GoGriftMe... Parkinson's is no joke. Vaccines work. Right-wing anti-vaxxers are fucking jokes.
0	Bravo to everyone who resisted all the threats, bullying and intimidation by the mainstream media, govs and elites to get the jab. This young woman is a great example that not all Gen Z are sheep and followers to do exactly what "influencers" on social media tell them to do. I have zero jabs and it is one of the proudest things I have done in my life. Yes I had to sacrifice many things, travelling, going to bars/restaurants but it was worth it.
0	It's all of them. If you're #vaccinated, you'd be wise to look up your batch numbers and adverse reports on them: https://t.co/rokn2NTERE #moderna #PfizerLiedPeopleDied #diedsuddenly https://t.co/QTgyVR07aK
1	Anti-vaccine activists recently murdered three people in Australia. They were radicalised online and driven to committing this atrocity because of the exploitative model of social media popularised by professional liars like Alex Jones in the USA.
0	One should really question the purpose of vaccinating healthy people with such an ineffective vaccine.
1	COVID. VACCINE. DOES. NOT. PREVENT. COVID. IT. MAKES. CASES. MILDER. AND. REDUCES. YOUR. CHANCE. OF. DYING.  I'm tying to keep an open mind and listen to anti Vax concerns but if you guys keep lying to yourselves, then you're waaaayyyy beyond brainwashed. Seriously, I'm sympathetic and feeling sorry for those who got tangled up in this nonsense. You guys close your eyes to stats and into, and keep repeating the same bullshit in every post.
1	Vaccines are safe and have been proven to be effective
1	11."I don't think the COVID vaccine will be effective in the long term. I think it's just a temporary fix."
0	Makes me happy reading the comments! Love how many of us are fighting back and not being sheep!
0	This is how it played out in my household... none of us got the vax. It took almost 2 years for my wife and 2 kids (12 and 2) to get covid. My 2 year old boy didn't have any symptoms and my 12 year old daughter had a slight head cold (sniffles and small cough) my wife had a light headache for a day and a half and a slight cough, I never contracted it. Everyone I know that got vaxxed were extremely sick and had it for a while.... but that's just my family. ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è
1	Vaccination is the key to herd immunity and stopping the pandemic. Let's all do our part. #HerdImmunity
0	The vaccines are poison. Nothing else. There is no inherent benefit, there is only the possibility for harm.
1	Vaccination is literally the reason that we don‚Äôt have to worry about smallpox and polio
0	over boosting is causing the breakdown of people's immune systems.
0	You can't get brainwashed if you don't have a brain in the first place.  I have a friend who welcomely took the vaccine and willing to take the third dose just be because he was told to get it . He never questioned for a second what are its consequences or at least build uo his own opinion. But you know, the role of the pawns must be fulfilled at some point and those people are here to do it.
0	This is what I've been saying ALL ALONG! For those who have not taken the jab (PLEASE DON'T) but if you still unsure on what to do AT LEAST WAIT until the 2 year clinical trials are over and all the safety data pertaining to this vaccine is in & analyzed so you can MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION!!!
0	It made me an anti vaxxer because while researching this shot I found out all kinds of things about the others. Also, mankind lived quite fine for many thousands of years before they were invented. They really have only been around for 70ish years or so
0	I felt lightheaded after getting the vaccine.
0	I led a very active and healthy life for 68 years. Never smoked, consumed a very clean, green diet and got plenty of fresh air exercise. In June, 6 weeks after my first Astra Zeneca jab I had a stroke. I have recovered well (I can talk and walk), but there are hidden effects from the stroke so my life is very limited now. My partner is in his 70‚Äôs and has become my carer. We are not prepared for what lies ahead...
0	Unreal,.. do you think were idiots!! Complete BS. This is whats called controlled opposition.. Why is thos guy on a major news network? He of course did not come out on his own accord,..  Big Pharmas behind this traitor... Where is he getting his numbers?  Hes flat out full of it..
1	As soon as the vaccine is deemed safe to use and available to me, I will take it in a heartbeat.
1	I got the vaccine because it's not just My health on the line but it's the health of others that I come in contact with!
0	Iv had covid 3 times with no issue. My body my choice! Plus without the vaccine I don‚Äôt spread it without knowing like the asshats who did get it.
1	yes , i would want my wife and family to be safe by being vaccinated and NOT anti-vax
0	People that continue to take boosters must have a death wish I swear! It's honestly mind-boggling
1	Bro I swear if yall dont vaccinate your kids when u become a parent...
1	I feel proud to have gotten my vaccine and to be doing my part in ending this pandemic. Let's all do the same!
0	I am 68 years old,  not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy.  In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a  so happy we did.
1	I believe in science and trust the experts who say the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective
1	cool i really want to go to movies and bars and concerts and live comedy shows again this has been the most depressing year
0	I don't trust the government and pharmaceutical companies to tell me what's good for my health
0	It makes zero logical sense to take this junk!!! How much are you being paid to sell this junk?
1	If you‚Äôre not vaccinated screw you. You want everyone to cater to you and your feelings and won‚Äôt do a simple 5 min shot you can get anywhere.
1	The vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop you from getting the virus. It reduces your chance of dying from it if you do get it.
0	That's a hard no, haven't had any of the shots stopped wearing mask in like April of 2020 and have made it through the most deadly pandemic ever just fine. Keep your experimental shots I will trust my time tested mine system, regular exercise, healthy diet and plenty of outdoor activity.
0	I'm glad my family doctor said I didn't need the vaccine.
1	I'm 75 with very serious health issues and had 2 vaccines and plus a booster. I did end up getting COVID anyway. But I was only sick 2 days and never got hospitalized. Praise God.
1	But someone who struggled to pass high school science said on fb that the vaccine isn't safe hit me up with it when it's my turn.
0	Not mentioning why is the government forcing the jab? There must be something in the so-called vaccine that they even send people to your house to put it in you
0	DO NOT GET VACCINATED! Covid vaccine is lethal.
1	My heart goes out to all these people :( So sad misinformation got the better of them and they now have to go through such hell. Love to the mom and her son who were separated <3
0	The deaths of several very weak and terminally ill nursing home patients in Norway following vaccinations are a warning flag.
0	What a amazing disaster to inject society w a vac under tested ! Not in my world I‚Äôm not a Lab rat !
0	More people have died since they introduced vaccines, than the timeframe without them.
1	Vaccines are the most helpful tool against COVID
1	Yes, also encourage your friends and family to get vaccinated.
0	Does this guy seem trustworthy to you? Does the BBC? Do our governments? Does Bill Gates? Does Big Pharma?
0	Voices of those with awful side effects of the vaccine are being suppressed. The general public still doesn't get what's happening.
1	I'm happy to do my part in helping to end this pandemic.
0	I've read too many horror stories about vaccines causing harm.
1	And their messiah, Trump, still got his vaccine. But of course he did it in private because he couldn't bear to lose his antivax base.
1	I'm proud to have my COVID vaccine. It's our best weapon against this virus. #VaccinePride
1	I can't argue with these anti-vaxx conspiracy theorists. It is just not worth it.
0	All those people who got vaccinated will regret it in a few years.
0	All side affects, including death.
1	What do ya think Bots? I got 4 shots and will be getting more. Love it!
1	Now that this is approved, I'm going to get it. If it's been given full approval I have no reason to believe it is any more or less dangerous than any other vaccine I've gotten.
0	Because lefties do as they‚Äôre told.
1	What I'm basically reading here is if you had been vaccinated by Moderna or Pfizer you can get a Moderna or Pfizer booster and your approximate rate and type of symptoms, as well as your improvement in efficacy against COVID, are roughly the same. It also shows (of course) that a booster is recommended no matter which of the 3 you originally had.
1	People before the new vaccine: ugh wish companies would develop a vaccine faster Companies: develop a vaccine faster People: now I don‚Äôt want it
1	My parents did not want the vaccine. It took my daughter‚Äôs (now 9 months) cardiologist telling them their granddaughter is high risk (she just had successful open heart surgery) and if they didn‚Äôt they could irreparably harm her. That she is too young for the vaccine and it wasn‚Äôt fair for them to make that choice for her. They did it and will be getting their boosters.
0	Still unvaccinated and healthy as ever thank you Jesus Ô∏è
1	The above is true and everyone needs to pay close attention to what each individual ad above says to help protect those individuals that are affected by COVID-19. Many families have family members that fall into this category.
1	The science supports it!
0	The fake vaccine narrative is completely falling apart
0	Yes, the Covid-19 gave people critical heart issues which killed them. The dead can't catch or spread Covid-19. So the vaccine works - by killing people and preventing the spread.
1	we need to forward this to karen
1	Never underestimate the stupidity of the public and their willingness to believe anything that feeds into their fears. Also never underestimate a politician and their willingness to utilise anything to gain power.
0	Professor Cox is to be applauded for airing very reasonable questions on behalf of a concerned public. Unfortunately, certain of the responses leave a lot to be desired. The cells within our bodies DO NOT generate vaccines themselves upon receipt of mRNA 'information'. They generate proteins characteristic of the virus being targeted, which the immune system then attacks. It's like pushing a 'self-destruct' button. As to new variants being 'selected for rapid spread rather than by immune response', words fail me (though not completely). We're not talking about breeding dogs or race-horses here. A fast-spreading pathogen is the consequence (as in result) of selection by and within the host population. It's not designed for the purpose but succeeds on account of the hosts' susceptibility to it. With a whole raft of viruses simultaneously seeking to gain entry (and at the same speed) suppression of any individual, or specific group of intruders, will obviously favour the unimpeded candidates. New variants do not out-race the competition by being inherently 'faster' in the commonly understood sense of the word, but by simply being allowed in more easily, like celebrities 'jumping the queue' outside a night-club.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	Vaccines have #CowMeat
1	What‚Äôs wrong with waiting a little bit to see the effects of this new vaccine? Nothing wrong with doing some due diligence first
0	I think that if I had to choose between taking the vaccine and starving to death I would opt for the latter
1	I‚Äôve got Covid now and because I‚Äôve gotten all of my vaccines, I feel perfectly normal!  Thank you Dr Fauci!!!
0	I trust the medical community and the COVID vaccine. It's a vital tool in the fight against this virus.
0	I am a pure blood and the majority of my family is as well.  We are so glad we discerned how dangerous it would be, and listened to the whistle blower doctors and scientists and rejected it!
1	Thank you, this was very insightful. Was the paper now published. It was observed that 2 dose Pfizer had a faster winning than 2 doses Moderna, thus I was curious how the Pfizer booster (3rd dose) will behave after 29 days vs the Moderna booser (3rd dose).
0	That‚Äôs nice. Still not getting it. You know where you can stick it.
1	Thank you for letting me join. I swear I've just been in constant fights with tin foils on every news post. So happy to be apart of a group of sane people.
1	The vaccines do work, and they are effective. I think it saved millions and millions of lives around the world.
1	Fuck Anti Vaxxers
1	Pfizer and Moderna were proven to be around 94-95% effective. Johnson and Johnson was argued that possibly it could be more than the 66% efficacy rate based on the different circumstances that it was trialed under. I will definitely go with the vaccine that was proven to be 94-95% effective, instead of the one that might be more effective based on the differing variables it was tested under.
0	9. "I've received the vaccine and feel much safer now."
0	Just because the government and some doctors, in whom many of us trust, press people to follow through with something, it does NOT mean there's justification behind it. I did not allow nor encourage my family to get the poison. I sincerely hope that those who fell victim to this negligence find some sort of peace and healing
1	I am getting my second dose tomorrow. I am so excited.
1	I am 49 y.o. and I got my first shot of the Pfizer vaccine today. Yes, my arm hurts a little and throughout the day I have felt a little warm but not really like a have a fever though. Also, I have felt just a little low on energy but not really fatigued that I would like to be in bed all day. I can say that, other than the slight pain on the arm where I got the shot I have felt pretty much normal without any other side effect. I hope my body is starting to make antibodies despite my very mild side effects.
1	CAUTION: I TURNED INTO A LIZARD AFTER MY 1ST COVID SHOT
0	Why? So when you want to throw out another virus you can jab us with more poison. People have been harm from the covid jab and that was always your agenda. You evil people only want to harm, depopulate and control/enslave us. So I say stick your jabs right up where the sun doesn‚Äôt shine.
1	In order to get covid under control, Children are supposed to have to be vaccinated
0	Vaccines are full of harmful heavy metals and other bullshit.
0	I don't want  that shit in my arm!!!  It's.  Insane!!,
0	I don't believe the official numbers and statistics on the vaccine's success rate, there's too much manipulation and misinformation
0	I'm SO glad I'm not the only one who still trusts his gut feeling and discernment about things! Just because the government and some doctors, in whom many of us trust, press people to follow through with something, it does NOT mean there's justification behind it. I did not allow nor encourage my family to get the poison. I sincerely hope that those who fell victim to this negligence find some sort of peace and healing
0	Feel sorry for all the people who thought they were doing the world some good for getting there vaccine. Pray for humanity
1	There are 19 different vaccines required by the military. Drawing a line in the sand regarding the COVID-19 vaccine definitely seems more like a political statement than one center around ethics. The military really doesn't have time for that B.S..
1	anti vax just needs to sign a form that they wont receive help for their covid instead of taking up space of someone else in need
1	I just got my first COVID shot yesterday. No fever. No soreness. No symptoms beyond a vague suggestion of a headache today.I‚Äôm definitely going to get the second shot as scheduled on April 28th, to finish the job.
0	I don't trust the government
1	It is significantly more dangerous to drive to the doctors' office than to get the vaccine.
1	Vaccination is a crucial step in getting our lives back to normal, protect yourself and others by getting vaccinated
1	I‚Äôve gotten the vaccine twice so have my teen children and everyone is fine.
1	Hate to say it....but I had 5 shots and STILL alive and well at 64.
1	They should get their assess vaccinated now because the original vaccines still provide substantial protection against hospitalization and death, both of which are things the various forms of omicron have done to many, many people.
1	At my age I take no chances. I also like to follow scientific¬†¬†facts
1	I have vaccinated in USA
0	They didn't just say you were an anti-vax, they said you should be physically held down and vaxxed
1	Vaccines save lives; fear endangers them.
0	There is an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine
1	Why do people who get vac care if others don‚Äôt?
1	No shaming of others. Excellent stuff. I thought I was at risk due to medication allergies but after speaking to my doctor, she recommended the COVID-19 vaccine. I got the Moderna one and fully vaccinated since March. I didn't have any major side effects and I'm still doing fine
1	Two-dose COVID vaccine efficacy durable against severe Omicron but drops in elderly
0	If i knew what I know now 22 years ago my children would NEVER have gotten vaccinated
0	Shes being paid to say
0	I am 68 years old, not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy. In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a so happy we did.
0	I'm not a person who takes medication unless absolutely necessary. I waited to see the outcomes and was unhappy with the results.
0	This is so weird. I am not vaccinated, as I didn't feel like taking a vaccine that had no previous longterm study. I hadn't caught covid up until the end of December 2021. I had all these beginning symptoms you describe here. A bad headache, my body hurt, my skin felt like I had a sunburn. All of this mainly subsided by day 10 and then another 5 days for my breathing and stamina to regulate. Sounds like actually catching covid was easier then getting this shot and dealing with the unnatural side affects. God made our bodies strong. People need to stop listening to these so called experts (who are in big pharmas pocket) and start tapping into the spirit within. We are strong energetic beings, if only we start treating our bodies and minds like the temple they are meant to be.
0	Why is everyone so quick to jump on the vaccine bandwagon? Don't you do some research first?
0	I was forced to take the first 2 shots. Next time, I‚Äôll take a job loss. So. No.
1	I find people funny that say they would NEVER get vaxxed‚Ä¶those are the same people that forgot that when they were babies they got their needles AND before they entered grade 1. These people make me laugh, Dr. Mike.
1	Are you a good, decent citizen? Are you vaccinated?‚Äù
0	"Safe and effective". Cerebral hemorrhage. Brain stem entrapment. Brain stem herniation from hemorrhage. Myocardial infraction in young people. Irregular troponin levels. Sudden "no longer with us". Pulmonary embolism. Organ failure. Cardiac arrest. Extreme flu, then "no longer with us". Increased heart palpitations. Respiratory arrest. Brain oedema. Brain aneurysm. Low blood pressure. Fever.
0	And then when it happens to you all you're gonna get is a "Welp I guess you're unlucky"
0	pople has gotten very rich from the vaccine and people still getting sick
0	Yes, now let's talk about the number of people labeled as covid deaths & actually dying of comorbidity, the number of vax related deaths & the number of adverse reactions.
1	It's a beautiful day for my 2nd dose of #Moderna
0	He/they could start by explaining their control group where they generate these ‚Äúfaith‚Äù statistics and then don‚Äôt pack millions of people in 50 square mile cities. Can we replicate the entire situation as an experiment? It‚Äôs not science, it‚Äôs at best, educated guesses using science as a marketing strategy.
1	Yes! Fully vaxxed and boosted. No COVID!
0	And now we are seeing the effects of the poison on people who got it.
0	I trust this stuff about as much as I trust the people pedalling it.
0	So many unknowns with this vaccine.
1	The worst problem with "doing your own research" is confirmation bias. If you look for something you'll find it, be it true or not
0	ONLY MENTALLY ILL DOCTORS APPLY MEDICINE FOR CURE TO A HEALTHY PEOPLE. COMMON SENSE WHICH IS NOT COMMON NOW WILL REBUKE YOU!
1	These weirdos think taking Vitamins D, C and Zinc is somehow beneficial to their immune systems. Just get the vaccine people!!!
0	Do yourself a favour. Don't get it. The medium and long term effects are unknown.
1	Im all for the vaccine
0	I'm unvaxxed and not dead yet. How is that possible?
0	As a Norwegian im gonna nominate you for a Nobel price. You made me not take the vaccine and it probably saved my life. High levels of vitamin D is the best defence. Thank you sir
0	And I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs harmful to not at least entertain the idea that it‚Äôs completely possible these vaccines are messing with peoples hearts and to not at least admit it‚Äôs possible is very dangerous
1	No vaccine, no hope
0	The profits are safe and effective.   However the product‚Ä¶ is something else.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	Dangerous and defective *
1	With regard to covid in general, and covid vaccines in particular, you need to weigh up the risks of the disease against the risk of the vaccine. So far, all we know is that there can be some allergic reactions to the vaccine. But there could be other risks that we don‚Äôt know yet. Similarly, the risks vary with regard to covid itself. For some the risks are greater than others.
1	I think most people say its confusing say it cause they don't like what they are being told. Im not a doctor n I've never been confused about any of this. Sometimes,because all of this is new, even the experts don't know the exact answers but thats not confusing it just means we aren't sure so here's our best guess.
0	Don't get the shot
0	Vax causes cancer, heart attack, stroke, etc.
0	Pro : may stop covid Con : you will crave human flesh
0	ZERO PROOF that the Covid vaccine has ever saved anyone‚Äôs life. We do, however, have LOADS of proof that those who died of Covid were immune compromised. Focus on your health. Stop falling for the Big Pharma lies.
1	I am vaccinated today and my arm sore 24 hour I am very excited to see the end of Corona
0	Seems like the vaccine didn‚Äôt work. Why would I get it?
1	After 5 shots, I had no side effects. However, the anti vaxers promised me 5G but my Verizon calls still drop.
1	Thanks for your rational and data-backed perspective. It's seems the benefit likely outweighs the risks
1	I'll be inviting myself into the queue as quickly as I can manage.Even if I'm no longer an ‚Äòessential worker' in a fairly high risk environment.
1	In fact I loved the symptoms of covid. Just minor headace. And loved the way I used to get deep sleep for 12-13 hour in a day. And when I looked around things around me seemed so beautiful and rich in colour. Seemed everything juicy. Felt as if I don‚Äôt have body and I m floating. A beautiful experience.
1	Everyone that wanted vaccine got one, the rest chose to not be vaccinated so Darwin can get to the work.
1	I just don't understand vaccine hesitancy. At 67 (today!) I've had four vaxx shots and last week a 5th, the Pfizer bivalent. Just get the shot, what's the big deal?
0	This is NOT an isolated incident‚Ä¶. Beware before you let the pharmaceutical companies put something in you!
1	Many of us are pro vaccine, because we have historical evidence of the efficacy of vaccines in reducing, eliminating or preventing the spread of historic diseases.
0	The government is the source of the misinformation. The masks don't work and neither do the vaccines. But the government worked to silence any voices of dissent, like the Soviet Union did with dissidents.  If the Democrats could get away with it, they'd set up gulags for free-thinking people who won't mouth the party line.
0	This is an even bigger psy-op than the Iraq invasion thing. And even more obvious.
0	CDC: 397 children suffered heart inflammation after Covid vaccine (age 12-17)
0	Everyone in family is vacinated except me. Everyone caught covid except me. Go figure......
0	I am so sick of everybody shoving everything under the carpet and thinking these vaccines are life-saving!
1	Good to see the ongoing efficacy, there is no reason to expect the vaccines will not continue  to protect us unless the evolutionary pressure on the virus produces a variant where the spike proteins making match any of those targeted by the vaccines.
1	Being a health care worker I trust the vaccine made by our scientists. I got both the dosses of covishield. It has really helped me to develop immunity against covid19
1	Ummm, no -- comparing anti vaxxers to mass shooting victims is such a terrible take. I can't even imagine a situation where mass shooting victims antagonized the person that shot them or argued that the person about to shoot them isn't a threat to their lives. Making that comparison is honestly insulting to people who lost their lives in mass shootings.
0	I hate that I live in the same place as the people who supported and participated in this scam.
1	See, I don't know ANY vaccinated people who have "died suddenly." But I know of quite a few unvaccinated people who have died from Covid. My daughter's mom works in the ER and she's told me all kinds of people who were unvaccinated and died. It was her stories that helped convince me to get vaccinated when I was still on the fence
1	The vaccine prevented transmission. The more people that are vaccinated the more transmission was reduced. Just because they are ‚Äòleaky‚Äô (whatever that means), does mean they didn't work.
0	I am also unvaccinated and plan to stay this way. But of all these vaccine injury videos I‚Äôve watched I don‚Äôt know of anybody in my major city who has had an adverse effect..but I still don‚Äôt want to take that small chance
1	The COVID vaccine is your best defense.
0	I will be declining the COVID-19 vaccine because of science and facts ‚Ä¶
1	Without the vaccine, another 100,000 of you Brits would have died last year- anti vaxxers- hang your heads in shame for your views- you have the same mindset of the 17th century witch hunter!
0	Bravo to everyone who resisted all the threats, bullying and intimidation by the mainstream media, govs and elites to get the jab. This young woman is a great example that not all Gen Z are sheep and followers to do exactly what "influencers" on social media tell them to do. I have zero jabs and it is one of the proudest things I have done in my life. Yes I had to sacrifice many things, travelling, going to bars/restaurants but it was worth it.
0	vaccine? my crystals will protect me
1	If you don‚Äôt believe physicians advice on vaccines how do you reconcile believing they can treat you once you‚Äôre sick?
1	I have full confidence in the science and researchers behind the COVID vaccines, and feel lucky to have received it.
0	After getting the vaccine, I experienced pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.
0	@MattWallace888 Yes absolutely. None of us were given the information which was even available at the time to allow informed decisions to be made over what goes into our bodies. The entire #Covid19Vaccine saga is of grate concern or at least should be. We need the truth behind all of it.
0	No aspiration was done however aspiration was done, if you use the play back option and slow down the video speed you can clearly see who aspirated from who didn‚Äôt, training is needed.  And why the bias towards MnRNA vaccines,  we didn‚Äôt hear about efficacy when polio and other types of shots were administered.
0	It's a pandemic of the vaccinated.
0	I've heard from 1000's of people that said they regret having had the jabs and stopped getting them, but have yet to find even one person (anywhere) that says they wish they had had them.
0	If vaccines are so safe,  why don't they accept liability ?
1	For those that choose to be unvaccinated - you are choosing to die rather than live. Hope you get your wish.
0	I can relate to the hesitancy. After I received my covid vaccine I spent the next few days hallucinating. That is not an experience I plan on repeating.
0	I'm 43 the second shot gave me a reaction where I had fluid around my heart. Doctor said this is normal for my age for a day or 2 maybe a week. It lasted for over a month. Chest pain heavy. For a month.
1	I am extremely disappointed that Reggie will not be seeing you today (because we love and respect everything about you) but if it was for this...I am so happy you have the opportunity to get the vaccine!
0	I've heard stories of people getting sick after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, and I don't want to take that risk.
1	I'm going to wait the full 48-72 hours before I make a thread on side effects I've experienced with the #astrazenecavaccine . So far, my symptoms can be managed with OTC meds, fluids & bed rest. And yes, I am still #provaccination & #procovidvaccine , despite how my body feels.
0	My fiance's cousin, a doctor in cardiology, fell over and died two hours after the vaccine shot. He was in great shape before this. So, go to hell with your lies and propaganda. Too many deaths and severe complications among the vaccinated for us to believe you anymore.
0	Let me tell you something now that the mandates have relaxed and the rest I just got one thing to say.THE WORLD HAS BEEN PLAYED
0	What a refreshing site to be able to hear points of view like I have I sometimes feel so alone as I have many questions regarding this experimental jab
0	I've heard of too many people experiencing negative side effects after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
0	I have been vaccinated twice but after what has happened to some people I hope thes criminals are put on trial along with their 'paymasters'
1	Correct the far-right misinformation spreaders whenever. #GetVaccinated
1	I don't think the COVID vaccine is necessary. I'll take my chances and rely on my immune system.
0	The vaccine safety has been voted on! A majority of Scientists and Doctors, without data, or comparative research decided it‚Äôs safe. This is called Scientific Consensus! It‚Äôs important people follow opinions, not facts, or you can‚Äôt move or travel. Get in Line! Using facts is racist!
0	Unless the definition of rare has been changed to mean 'happens a LOT' then these side effects aren't rare.
1	Always take care dear
1	Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science.
1	I‚Äôve had 2 vaccines & 2 boosters. Get regular blood tests & they are perfect. Guess what I haven‚Äôt had? COVID. Millions of folks have had vaccines
1	Winter is coming, keep yourself warm and healthy people. Take your shots.
1	I get my second jab tomorrow. Pretty excited about it.
1	A vaccine would be a good start to stop the spread, but in the meantime we need a treatment to mitigate the affects the virus has on the body. What gets me is the number of people that catch the COVID19 virus and do just fine or the people that catch the virus but never show any signs.
1	I will get my second vaccin tomorrow, so excited!
1	I trust Pfizer with my life. I‚Äôve gotten 5 of their vaccinations
0	How about consider MRNA jab injuries?
0	Pfizer ceo admitting countries who didn't want to import the jab wouldn't get the "nanoparticles" So the jabs contain nanoparticles.
1	I know this is just anecdotal experience, but almost everyone I know who got vaccinated, did not get Covid. Meanwhile the ones who did not get vaccinated, got Covid.These observations make me not regret my decision to get vaccinated.
1	My parents got the 2-shot vaccine, they're doing perfectly fine c: I'm getting the vaccine next week!
1	So annoying that so many are still unvaccinated even if they have the opportunity to get it.
1	I had two bad days, but a lifetime of relief.  I would do it over as needed.  I am the opposite of an anti-vaxxer.  I would take a vax every week if necessary.
0	I took the vaccine and now getting numbness in my hands and feet.
0	If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't have gotten the COVID-19 vaccine.
0	I‚Äôm not getting another mRNA shot since I got 2 blood clots in my lower leg that had to be surgically removed. The same month after my second Pfizer. My luck it morphed into a staph infection! My covid experience last summer was a cakewalk compared to my op and post op experience.
1	What the hell I want my third already
1	Finally a glimmer of hope in these dark times, #CovidVaccine is giving us the power to fight back!
0	I'll be over here, unvaxed and not dying suddenly....
1	diseases mutate and new ones emerge and new vaccines are created to combat old or new diseases
0	This is my best friend. He took the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and the next day had a speech impediment, more like a nervous tick, that some even mistake for Tourette‚Äôs
0	Yeah its safe , its just sometimes people can die , but its ok , thats the goal right
1	Anti Vaxxers: "You're a doctor? Well I watched a bunch of YouTube videos made by people with zero credentials and I'm not putting poison in my body!!"  Takes a long drag off a cigarette
0	My mom didn't have a shot or vaccine since the 50s. She got the #pfizer shot in May 2021. She was in the hospital 2 weeks later and never came home.
0	This is called modern sorcery from paid deceiver
0	my mom is immunocompromised and she had no problem beating covid too... from this thread the vaccine reaction looks like it may be more dangerous than the virus itself...
0	We are the same my situation after moderna vaccine I'm getting anxiety panic attack my heart is always palpitation and I'm getting the head and neck pain and gerd acid reflux is very hard handle this my situation because my feeling is pain my weight is Lost and I always feel tired
1	I feel like if the government and media didnt push it so much, more people would have got the shot. I know it sounds weird but people dont like being told what to do.
1	Antivax sheep are the most hilarious of all. All baaaaa baaaa the same tune. In unison now sheep
1	The anti-vaxx hysteria is nothing new but the Trump-led attack on science and reason has given it new virulence. It is just one more example of the damage done to the country by the last president that will take decades to repair.
0	ITS AN EXPERIMENTAL DRUG, DESIGNED TO KILL YOU WAKE UP !!!!!!!!!
1	My family and I are proudly #vaccinated and encourage families everywhere to get the vaccine!
0	I've never gotten a toxic clot-shot and never will. Frankly I can't imagine anyone paying good money for that sludge.
0	So who is going to jail for poisoning billions of people?
0	I had severe head pain for 2 days after the 1st dose of AstraZeneca's vaccine. Felt like my brain was expanding from the inside. It was the first time I ever had such pain. When I checked online, medical websites said that it's normal and I simply accepted it at the time. Sigh.
0	I consider it harassment. It's none of their business what I do with my body. I already had Covid for six weeks starting in December, 2019, before their were Covid tests or vaccines. I'm in a high-risk group and I survived with antibiotics for my sore throat. It was the cough that lasted six weeks.
0	placebo
1	Don't know about the maturity of the vaccine technology but feel that the vaccination is effective
1	I said the same thing. I was going to wait. I even told clients I was going to wait this first round. I could feel clients getting concerned because I was waiting. After hearing about a more contagious strain I knew I needed to jump on it. I can't afford to shut down my business again weeks on end plus I wanted to make my clients feel safe.
0	Seeing all the sudden deaths I‚Äôm very happy I didn‚Äôt take it.
1	This is so hard to watch. My mother died back in December and she didn‚Äôt have the option of getting the vaccine, but she would have taken it if it was available. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to see these people because they could have prevented if. Yes people are getting sick, but the odds of dying are highly reduced when vaccinated.
0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!!
0	not everyone dies from a COVID infection without any vaccine. That's propaganda. I know many many people who've been infected early in the pandemic and no one of them had the vaccine yet. And no one of them died. So not everyone dies of the COVID
0	Once you realize the people pushing transgenderism, LGBTQ, abortion, vaccines, assisted suicide and fat positivity are big advocates for depopulation, then everything starts to make sense
1	Herd immunity is important, get vaccinated to protect yourself and your community.
0	I was forced to get the first two for school and then i developed weird bladder issues.
1	It‚Äôs so interesting to me that Antivaxx was started on lies & continues on lies & yet so many people refuse to accept the truth that they are being lied to by Grifters & Con men!
0	I‚Äôm done with vaccines. This has been the biggest scam perpetrated to the public with fear as a weapon.
0	There are no benefits just more money for big pharma
1	It‚Äôs working, with all these morons who cant accept reality who blame vaccines instead of covid for deaths.. vaccines rarely had a fatal implication
1	good video! very concise and easy to understand. the graphics shown also helps in better understanding about the vaccine's roles. thanks! i'll show this video with my friends and family and those antivax
0	I still haven't had covid and I'm not vaccinated. My vitamins I take seem better than the vaccine. All my vaccinated friends are sick now.
0	Anyone with half a brain cell could see the jab roll out had zero impact on the fatality rate (deaths divided by cases of COVID). And the 'curves' were unchanged by it (meaning it didn't stop the spread). There was also plenty of 'breakthrough' cases that showed it didn't stop the spread. I'm an unvaccinated healthcare worker who is embarrassed that colleagues missed the clear signs. Considering this utter failure of the healthcare industry I'm not sure I want to remain in this business. I'm here to help people, not hurt them. I have spent a career telling patients we aren't hiding the cures so we can get rich off treating illnesses. This was a blatant slap in the face to everyone.
1	It makes sense given the pandemic status we were in though. I'm triple vaxxed and I'm perfectly fine.
1	I took the Pfizer second dose and got ABSOLUTELY HELLISH pain in my arm, it made me get no sleep cuz i had to change sleeping positions all night and the next day i had chills, fatigue and a mild fever
0	Not allowed to talk about known issues of the covid-19 vaccine. You're not allowed to be hesitant about it, you must only say and think positive things about the vaccine.
1	Get the vaccine, it's FREE
0	Five people showed allergic reactions after they were administered   vaccine._x000D_
0	Please keep all of your records. Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt know the harm they could cause‚Äù. We knew - they knew.
0	What deterred me was my own government made it impossible for the company's to be sued under proper due process. As soon as that was made to be, I decided, "no I'm good."
1	I hope they can make a universal COVID vaccine. That would be awesome! If they did that with a flu vaccine, that would be great too!
0	I remain happily unvaccinated and I plan on keeping it that way.
0	Pfizer are a very corrupt evil crimnila organization. Stop these experimental jabs NOW.
1	I got my 2nd shot from Moderna. I am so glad I finally got it!
0	It's not a vaccine, it's a theraputic. Vaccines prevent transmission and infection. After it became impossible to hide the fact that the clot shots didn't, they moved on to claiming they're theraputic.
0	They are lying about the vaccine!
0	My grandfather was diagnosed with blood cancer right after taking the 3 dose, my aunt said she couldn't wait to get the 3 shot.. She got a stroke 3 days later, and dont forget that so many young girls suddenly loose their period, my other aunt never had trouble with any health issues suddenly gets asthma. It doesn't seem right
0	My coworker passed away one week after the jab. Just a coincidence I'm sure.
0	CEO of Pfizer is on tape last year‚Äôs WEF saying goal is depopulate the world in half by 2025. Went on to say off to good start with vaccine. Why is congress, cdc,WHO, NIH etc.all exempted from mandates? Dangerous people, wake up world!
1	Roughly 6.8M J&J doses were delivered in the US...and folks are worked up over 6 adverse cases?
1	Finally, I did it and completed the doses #2Doc #moderna¬† #vaccine
1	I support mandatory COVID vaccination, everyone should do it.
1	The major reason why people, young and old, die from heart attacks, blood clots and cancer now is the anti vaxxers information campaigns - take notes on that!
0	Yesterday a house and lot was randomly given to a vaccine recipient just to boost "confidence" lol
0	The fact that many health professionals have gone along with this entire sham is beyond words. When you know the dangers of these jabs but continue to push this snake oil. People are getting hurt and developing long lasting health problems.
1	My spouse and I and all of our friends have had all the shots from the first to the most recent booster. We are all age 60+ (several in our 70's) and not one of us has experienced any negative reaction. Only one person has experienced only a very mild case of Covid with NO aftereffects. We all are free to make our own choice regarding these vaccines, but please remember that by being vaccinated you are protecting not just yourself but those around you.
0	Proud of this young lady for saying NO. I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda or this utter nonsense.
1	I'm done feeling sorry for non-vaxxers. They put healthcare workers, their loved ones. And anyone they come in contact with. They also put enormous increased presure on already highly stressed healthcare works. While I don't wish them harm, I don't feel sorry for them either when it goes very bad for them. The reality is there are ramifications of the desicions they have made. Sometimes these ramifications are long-term and sometimes permanent. We are all aware of the potential downside snd must live with them.
0	My brother had 4 strokes 30 days after getting both shots. The other has even hospitalized twice since he got both his shots. First within 30 days. That was August. Then a week ago. Tested positive for covid. You can keep your shots.
1	When I took Sinovac, my family went crazy hahaha but yeah, I'm comfortable with this decades-proven vaccine method
1	Do well and get vaccinated today, you owe yourself a COVID 19 free life.
0	No thanks, I don't need a vaccine for a virus I aint got
1	‚ÄúOur advocacy, which helped garner public support as well as the support of private companies, helped procure 12.66 million COVID-19 vaccine doses globally.‚Äù  #GlobalCitizen #ThePeopleVaccineAlliance   #AchewellFoundation
1	The vaccine wasn‚Äôt rushed it was streamlined. This is what happens when scientists and doctors are given the funds, support, equipment and staff numbers they need
0	I‚Äôll never have it
0	So nicotine is the vaccine? Funny im vaccinated thenü§£
0	All vaccines have risks and should always be voluntary.
1	In Bangladesh we are struggling because we don't have enough vaccine to immunize such a large population. Thankfully My family and I live in the capital (Dhaka) and we were able to get the 2 doses and my parents who are elderly in their late 60s got the 2 plus the booster. I am almost 38 and the other 3 of my siblings are still waiting to get the booster. Looking at the USA (for better or worse, the world always tend to follow what happens in the USA) it saddens me that these people are being stubborn and very selfish with the sense of entitlement is mind boggling.
0	If you are still supporting the Covid vaccine, you are a clown.
0	I regret getting it man.. I regret it
0	I got a J&J and a J&J booster and I'm just waiting to drop dead. Hoping the poison is only limited to the mRNA and not the viral vector but who really knows. Definitely lots of people dying from blood clots, cardiac issues, and some people just hitting the ground from SADs. It's hard to avoid the elephant in the room.
1	Don't bother trying to throw facts at the idiots. They are content to think they know better than any scientist or doctor. Let's allow Darwin's Law to sort it out.
0	No vaccine for us
1	great job biontech. Imagine a husband and wife team developed something this important. Just got mine on April 1st 2021
1	I rather take pfizer. I already take some of their products anyways lol
0	Pfizer created the vaccine knowing it would kill your immune system which would then keep you dependent on their other drugs to live the rest of your life.
1	The vaccine is safe, it's been tested on thousands of people.
1	Thanks, WHO. The majority of us appreciate your work and your explanations.
0	Fauci admits that COVID-19 vaccines do not protect 'overly well' against infection
1	Rumi, 13 was diagnosed with polio when she was a year old. Her parents, realizing the importance of vaccines, ensured her sister was vaccinated
1	I had covid and it almost killed me. All kinds of crazy and unpleasant symptoms. I still to this day, cannot fully smell. Mofos keep saying, "oh don't worry you'll get your sense of smell back." Meanwhile, 8 months later I'm still waiting for it to come back. What the heck is up with that?
0	Yeah,Its very rare to die from thrombosis in the brain when two of my closest friends, died within weeks of each other from this very thing a week after their vaccine. The truth is they dont know the risks and even if they did they wouldnt tell us.
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
0	Had so much side-effects from dose 2, NEVER AGAIN!
0	I got covid FOUR times. I got the covid vaccine ZERO times. I'm 71, drug-free and doing well.   Thank you immune system.
1	do you honestly think CDC scientists are getting rich doing their jobs? You think they get kickbacks every time an old person gets protected against a deadly disease? Nope. And even if such a thing were possible, it would not negate the fact that over a million Americans, and counting, have died of COVID and that people who are vaccinated have a vanishingly small chance of dying at this point.
1	39. "I don't think the vaccine is the solution to ending the pandemic."
1	No thanks. It's great to see everyone's face (and smiles) again. The vaccine was the endpoint. I'd rather have to have to more shots than deal with masks again.
1	The vaccine wasn‚Äôt rushed it was streamlined. This is what happens when scientists and doctors are given the funds, support, equipment and staff numbers they need
0	There is NO vaccine. It does not prevent, help, or stop. Therefore NOT a 'vaccine'.
0	Even the #scientists don‚Äôt trust the #science but ya do‚Ä¶lol  #FauciFiles #fauci #vaccine #Biden #thenoticing #Wuhan #Pfizer #BlackTwitter #vaccinated #DiedSuddendly #diedsuddenly #moderna  #bloodclots #MORE #MYOCARDITIS https://t.co/TC4fXc1Kjl
0	I knew I was right. Health is wealth. No way would I take something experimental for something that is 99.9% survivable. Crazy times!
0	I did not get the vaccine, nor do I have plans to get it. People are still getting sick after receiving the vaccine (google yankee‚Äôs baseball team covid) I also am a healthy male, gym daily and eat reasonably well. Some of the science is also net new which i‚Äôd rather everyone else be the lab rats. I‚Äôll wait till proven
0	I'm terrified for my friends and family that took the triple you know what.
0	Thank you so much for the information you've been putting out. So many have been violently against those of us that knew better than to trust these vaccines. This is one time im not happy to be correct.
1	Getting vaccinated is a responsible action and shows consideration for others.
0	As the sickos create new poison. That gain of function is not going to stop.
1	I still believe in the science. Yes the jabs have helped many people especially the vulnerable groups‚Ä¶ diabetics, people with health issues, the elderly, the young kids.
1	Got my vaccine and ready to get a booster to help with the different variants
0	FDA Sued for Withholding COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Analyses!!! Woo Hoo! They withheld the death Safety signal for over two years and are still pretending it hasn‚Äôt triggered even after admitting it did trigger in a FOIA request. The agencies are so corrupt.
0	It destroys all antibodies. And the reason they time the next shot at 8 weeks. Just about when your immune system wants to heal itself , it destroys your antibodies again.
0	I will never understand people who willingly trust these corrupt pharmaceutical companies
0	My sister got the vax when it first came out. With in a few hours she broke out in severe hive like welts all over her face and body. She landed in the hospital for almost a month, and it left her with a damaged heart valve from the heart swelling. I'm unvaccinated. I just caught Covid last week. I took literally nothing for it. Felt a bit run down, and had a crappy cough and chest congestion still, but otherwise I am completely fine. I'm a 45 year old male.
1	Everyone should get the vaccine ASAP!!!!
1	I had gnarly side effects from the vaccine. (Second shot kicked my ass.) Still glad I got vaccinated, would do it again.
0	I got the Pfizer and then a second Astra Zeneca vaccine. But then I started to have doubts, and realised that the people who I was told were mad conspiracy theorists, were just making a bit too much sense for comfort. I then refused a third booster. I wish the penny had dropped for me sooner.
0	Three years from now all your babes are going to be mutated from you infertility from vaccine.
1	The dude's wife never came off the ventilator. She ended up passing away right after this aired. It's sad because from time to time we have all had stupid beliefs it's just that this level of consequence is not something that we usually see within our lifetimes.
1	I had the vaccine completed.
0	I am a healthy 20 something year old man who is very healthy (ish) and has an active occupation in trade work. After receiving one (1) dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine I have had various symptoms from shakes and convulsions to muscle stiffness.
1	Just registered for my COVID-19 vaccination. Blessed
1	Just got the Sinovac vaccine. I honestly wanted Pfizer or Moderna, but I'm not complaining. With the Delta variant out right now, I'd just get the one that's immediately accessible because the rollout globally really depends on the supplies we have, especially in poorer countries where they do not have enough money to purchase vaccines. I'd figure that the more I put off vaccination, the faster virus mutates. I'd just want to say also that this is a great video since explains the reasons why it's important to get vaccinated sooner even if it were a less effective vaccine. It really is a race against time, so I'm glad I got inoculated.
1	Good morning Annie, does shaking out of anger at these videos count. The anti-vaxxer that I worked with has sent me two of them to ‚Äúprove‚Äù the ‚Äúdangers‚Äù of the vaccines.
1	After my first AstraZeneca vaccine jab, I went back to work immediately after, and not until dinner time the very evening, started feeling extremely lethargic, tired and weak all over. At one point when sitting down, it‚Äôs so difficult to even get back up - the ‚Äòsensation‚Äô was peculiar, like being half drunk, yet with a perfectly clear mind at the same time. However the first night‚Äôs sleep was nevertheless fantastic, had gone straight into dreams and I was feeling refreshed the next morning.
1	I'm not overly happy with the article stating twice its a anti-parasite drug for animals before mentioning its used for anti-parasite purposes in humans too. Need to be careful not to override the actual scientific importance of ivermectin as an anti-parasite just because antivax morons think it works as an antiviral
0	I experienced Renal failure, and very nearly died, right after taking the jab for my 3rd Pfizer booster. [documented by hospital records] I worry, what else may happen to my health.
1	Instead of doing research people just listen to fake news  and believe anything they hear!!! Vaccines should be mandatory for school students!!!
0	God will cure me
1	There is a reason smallpox and polio no longer ravage millions of people every year. Vaccines work.
1	out first thing for my latest covid jab I have had them all but wasn‚Äôt keen on having another but thought it best to get it so off I went .. glad I made the right decision again
0	Why did they require people to sign a waiver if the vaccines are safe?
1	I had cov before the vac came out and now I got the first vac shot. All I got to is good luck to them, they gonna need it. When they get lung pain that seem like it won't go away and they feel like they been beat down to death, they will wish they got the vac.
1	Immune system‚Äôs response to First Dose:  Doesn‚Äôt even notice Immune System‚Äôs response to second dose: YOU COME IN MY HOUSE
0	I took the Pfizer dose and got ABSOLUTELY HELLISH pain in my arm, it made me get no sleep cuz i had to change sleeping positions all night and the next day i had chills, fatigue and a mild fever
0	I never had the rona and never took the vaccine might be the reason why I never got the rona
0	I wouldn't trust any vaccine from the democratic Pharmaceutical COMPANIES. Nothing is safe anymore.
0	Tip of the iceberg. The next few years will be horrific.
0	Before the release of mRNA vaccines in the U.S. myocarditis occurred in 4 out of a million people. After it was 25,00out of a million. I hope these Medical tourists are ready for that potential .
1	Vaccination allows for safe gatherings and protects our communities.
0	this guy is not a doctor. Why are not more expert & front line doctors being heard, such as the 17000 from Global Covid Summit? This reporting is highly biased, and always has been.
1	I got the vaccine because I‚Äôm not a selfish ignorant asshole
1	When will people stop the conspiracy theories. Can we not just accept and appreciate the vaccine for what it is - THE CURE.
0	Students that got those jabs wont live past 35 or so.  Their lifespans were shortened by big pharma poisons and their fraud.
0	‚ÄúThe vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense.‚Äù
1	i could not see my grandparents for over a year, and i finally  got to see them after the vaccine
1	Yep. Did it, got the tee-shirt (joking‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt give out tee-shirts just immunization cards). It was a tremendous relief to quit having to be scared of interactions with people.  I highly recommend getting it as soon as you possibly can. Since it not only keeps you from getting sick but it ALSO keeps you from carrying the virus, it keeps you from making other people sick.  Get the shots. Besides saving your own life, you can save the lives of your family and friends!
1	Are you somehow unaware that virtually the entirety of the medical community recommends vaccination?
1	#vaccinated #VaccinesWork  Why are the vaccinated so aggressive on twitter ? https://t.co/bVb8UfJVFT
1	well don't forget the vaccine has not "activated yet." The vaccinated all have a timer now that will go off up to 5 yrs after vaccination. Instant death will happen upon activation of the timer- or so the anti-vaxxers say. Talk about fear mongering ridiculousness! üôÑ
0	Vaccine is a scam
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far.
0	The strategy is actually a very simple one: an absence of data does not demonstrate safety, it demonstrates an absence of the proof of safety. All other vaccines/medications, have gone through normal 5 year safety marker protocols with transparency of data at the end. Emergency measures removed this in addition to withholding of data that was available, therefore the default position is to assume a lack of safety until proven otherwise. That's all rational, not irrational.
1	Getting vaccinated protects those who are at a higher risk.
1	Sciences + vaxes = goodbye COVID! I'm so grateful for the amazing scientists and healthcare workers who have been working tirelessly to make these vaxes a reality. They're giving us all hope for a brighter future, and I'm just so glad I could do my part by getting vaccinated. Rollin' up my sleeve, who's with me?
0	The Covid 19 vaccine is not a vaccine. It is an mRNA injection and it is neither safe or effective. Full Stop
1	Decent people know it is still ongoing and worry about others, especially the most vulnerable.
1	They've been studying mRNA vaccines since the 70s. The first human uses were in 2001, guess how many years it's been since 2001... They've been using an mRNA rabies vaccine since 2013 and you've likely had an mRNA flu shot. Some people, man
0	What Utter Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is full of poisons, unknown material with unknown effects.
1	got a covid at 16, im scheduled to be vaccinated
1	I felt the same. I have never even got the flu shot as an adult. Once I did some real research I was excited to get vaccinated. Got my 2nd dose earlier this week. No side effects. Feeling good!
1	Why are so many Aussies anti vaxx? is your education system that bad?
1	First batch of doses of  vaccines are in ......YAY many congratulations
1	Yes. Because I, as a respectable and responsible member of society, wish to prevent deaths that may be caused if I am negligent. The vaccine is new, yes, but it has been tested, and is still being tested, and nobody, other than a few individuals who suffered from an allergic reaction to the vaccine, has died from the vaccine.
1	This is basically the same message sent from the German health department. If you don't plan on getting vaccinated, plan on getting the virus, being very sick, and possibly dying. This is not hysteria, this is a fact.
0	it seems to me the government agenda is focused on maximum ROI from vaccines not on public health
0	Another big lie about the covid vaccine. IT NEVER STOPPED the spread of covid nor someone from getting covid. He turned our country into a police state and force Americans out of their jobs. ‚Å¶YES, ‚Å¶@JoeBiden ‚Å© did that!!!
0	"Keep using that mask"... yeah. Because that worked so well.
1	Please do a little research on how the virus attacks our bodies and how the vaccines work to stop that process.
0	My uncle/brother/friend/grandma had the vaccine and grew a fourth arm.  Must be the vaccine.
0	No vac for me
0	A measles vaccine prevents measles and that‚Äôs effective. How can COVID be considered a vaccine when it takes multiple boosters? It‚Äôs like a flu shot but it does not eradicate a disease.
1	I took my 5th shot a couple of weeks ago and I'm 60 yrs old
1	There is no evidence of negative consequences, and we have paused the world for this virus. Get the vaccine and get back to our lives.
0	I did a hard pass on a rushed vaccine and all my friends were begging me to take it
1	Needles scare me but hey, I just got the Russian #SputnikV Vaccine
0	Im happy @KyrieIrving was able to stand his ground and never get #vaccinated. #weball
0	that doctor they talked to has no clue , where did they find him lol what studies is he talking about ? oh the ones from the drug companies ? I have lost trust in most doctors
1	I have Covid now. My 2 year old had it much worse than me. I barely feel like I have a cold and feel 99%. I‚Äôve had my updated booster but he has not yet.
0	Good luck you believe everything they say don't really know what you have done and you advised other's to go for it are You a doctor specialising in vaccine
1	I took Covishield (AstraZeneca) Vaccine yesterday Developed mild fever, bad headache, body aches. Feel slightly better now, as symptoms are reducing. Took acetaminophen for symptomatic relief. Stay Safe people
1	I was vaccinated last 2 months 15vdays before,  last week my wife and my baby was infected and I don't have any fiver or hedect, I have only dry cough now can I take sceond dose of vecine....or I will postpone the scwons dose.
0	Why is the media and world governments SILENT on the massive amount of vax side effects? Because they were in on the scam and attempt at a second Holocaust?
0	Apparently, a side effect of being vaccinated over and over again is becoming dumb AF.
0	I expect we're gonna be seeing a lot of this hemming, and hawwing crap coming out of them over the next ten years as more and more side effects come to public view. Of course, assuming some of the other large, looming things don't take place in the coming years. No one can convince me that their rushing the trials doesn't mean that they rushed the trials. Some the stuff these people say is some of the dumbest crap I've heard in my life. I expect a number of revealed problems.
1	Thanks for sharing this doc it gives me an idea what vaccine woul i take
1	vaccine saves lives, I have had 2 Astra Zeneca, and now I‚Äôve just had my booster of Pfizer, the only side effect was a sore arm, as I am in my 70 tys having the vaccine against getting COVID-19 in a no brainier.
0	Don‚Äôt go anywhere near a vaccine, especially covid vaccine, or your health will quickly disappear!
0	is there a single intelligent person in the world who has taken the vaccine?
1	I am a 63 year old Grandmother and a stage IV cancer survivor. At the advice of my doctors, I have received both Covid vaccines and I have also been boosted 3 times! The only side effect I have ever experienced from any of these Covid vaccines was a sore arm that lasted 1/2 day. I live an active life and I have never gotten Covid. I have several friends and family member‚Äôs who refuse to get vaccinated and they have had Covid several times. Thank goodness so far none have been hospitalized yet. I have a friend who mother is 67 years old, she is a heavy smoker as well. She is also a MAGA Republican who believes that Covid is not real. She has been hospitalized twice with severe Covid and survived but she refuses to admit that she had Covid. Of course she also refuses to say that smoking cigarettes is bad for her lungs too! Go figure.
0	Once again the vaccines seem to be FAR less effective than originally advertised
0	And they want to still push this on us, this vaccine
1	Sadly, it appears the anti-vaxxers have arrived to promote their Infectivist malarkey. Modern vaccines are proven safe!  Don't allow yourselves to be bamboozled by these pro-disease nitwits.
0	vaccines literally injects you with a disease/illness you could possibly have no association with just to fight it off‚Ä¶ my kids will pass.
0	Because I am a Targeted Individual since 911...let me tell you something...I have been subjected to Direct Energy Weapons and Psychotronics for the past 22 years....I KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON
0	I didn‚Äôt get them and I‚Äôm here too, live and let live brah
0	To every health care worker that takes a stand against the vaccine, you are our first line of defense against the insanity gripping the nation. thank you
1	my risk of severe illness and hospitalisation it‚Äôs still greatly reduced as compared to being unvaccinated, unvaccinated people still make up the overwhelming majority of deaths. Do you think they may have been the main carriers of delta since the majority of people are now vaccinated? It helps to add a little common sense to statistics to help understand them. I see you may struggle with that.
0	I felt weak after getting the vaccine.
0	Maybe vax related or not, you can judge. My wife's aunt who was very healthy diead two weeks after getting the vax, from a stroke. A 24 year old friend of mine who plays sports took the vax and boosters, he has since been having series of mini strokes. I never took it, I got corona and it was like a weak flu. No thanks.
0	It gave me severely heavy menstrual bleeding that still hasn't stopped 17 months later. 17 consecutive months of bleeding all day every day. High doses of progesterone wont even stop it and now I need a hysterectomy. Thanks a lot Pfizer.
1	Anti vacxxers aka *RETARDS*
1	#Asymptomatic #COVID19 patients do not suffer #sequela, according to recent research.  #coronavirus #sarscov2 #covid #covid19vaccine #covid19research
1	Funny how this only seems to happen to those that were anti-vax in the first place. That couldn't possibly be a coincidence, could it. No, this random re-posted tiktok must absolutely be 100% genuine and not made up at all.
1	I can‚Äôt wait to be vaccinated.I am in the high risk group. I have diabetes. COPD. So I don‚Äôt want to get this virus.
0	After vaccination, my muscles are twitchin, heart rate is irregular, sensitive to light.. wtf is happening
1	I think people who are anti-vaccine are just misinformed. Vaccines save lives.
1	Protect yourself and your baby. Get the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and help reduce the risk of severe illness.  #ProtectYourBaby #vaccinateduringpregnancy #COVID19Vaccine #staysafe #healthymomhealthybaby #fightcovid19 #vaccinationsaveslives #StayProtected
1	At least antivaxxers are thinning themselves out.
0	There should be more measures or schemes to improve our immune system rather than getting injections to prevent diseases.
1	the amount of stupidity in these comments are absurd
0	48y Male here. 1 vacinne and 2 x boosters. Not had Covid. But I also take Vitamin D and K2 everyday and eat healthy food (most of the time). I think the Vitamins have helped more than the Vacinnes.
0	Unfortunately,  we all knew when receiving the vaccine that it was prescribed in " emergency measures" So we had no choice but to trust the epidemiologists! I have a clinically vulnerable son, so wanted to protect him. Thankfully,  omicron is upper resp compared to the original strain, delta etc. That caused ace receptor life threatening pneumonia. No more vaccines in our household! The stats are frightening!  As for the JVCI & WHO? As a healthcare professional,  I'm disgusted!
1	I am fully vaccinated now! Yay! Go me!
0	SaFe AnD eFfEcTiVe!!!
0	So many people coerced into   - all producing deaths and permanent side effects
1	Pro-vaccine, pro-science, pro-common sense, anti-COVID 19, anti-preventable death, anti-preventable illness, anti-lies, anti-conspiracy theories, anti-deliberate misinterpretation or complete fabrication of data, anti-misleading statistics, anti-poor mathematics.
0	What scares me most about this is there is a No Liability Clause which means I cant sue them and recieve compensation for any damages that might be caused by this even up to death
1	I'm planning to be vaccinated.

0	Give it up, almost everyone I talk to regrets ever getting the clot shot
1	Thank you for trying. I still can‚Äôt convince my brother to get the vaccine because he thinks he has ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù to COVID-19. Despite the fact that I‚Äôm a nurse and on the front lines of this nightmare, he won‚Äôt budge.
1	The vaccine is a symbol of hope and progress in the fight against COVID-19.
0	The vaccines are ineffective and vaccinated people can have even higher viral loads, then the unvaxxed.
0	Child murdered by Covid vaccines‚Ä¶ no compensation to the victim‚Äôs bereaved family was given
1	How do we make covid deniers/skeptics follow the guidelines and take the vaccine? Im really starting to believe strong government intervention will be needed
0	42. "I believe getting vaccinated is the only way to achieve herd immunity."
0	Then I got covid 3 times in the same year, im fully vaccinated unfortunately
1	It‚Äôs much much more likely they‚Äôre collapsing from issues due to long COVID than it is from getting the vaccine.
1	I said No Way at first but after doing some reading and listening to experts in the medical and science community I decided to get the vaccine. I get my first shot tomorrow! I'm ready!
0	These toxins are being injected into children allowed by the parents..so sad
0	That‚Äôs vital, because a draconian system of enforcement could embed deeper polarisation and resistance at a time when we need cohesion and agreement more than ever.
0	Same game plan that Hitler used to kill 20 million people. Stalin 30 million people. Next to come, planned food shortages, power shortages, and a fake crisis to allow foreign troops to maintain order (most likely Chinese Military) This is a communist takeover and this is what it will be like. Their population goal is 1 billion by 2050 or sooner.
1	The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines does not compromise their safety. In fact, the development process was accelerated due to the pressing need to control the spread of the virus, but the same rigorous testing and clinical trials were conducted to ensure their safety.
1	This paper explores two case studies of pro-vaccine activism in Australia and the United States (US).

1	As a researcher with 35 years of experience, including vaccine development, I really enjoyed this video. I am planning on sharing it with people who are scared of the though of taking a next generation vaccine. BTW, I am getting my second dose today.
0	Can anyone explain to me why we still have vaccine mandates in Australia? They‚Äôre not safe, and not effective - yet they‚Äôre mandated by @SAHealth and other anti-scientific organisations
0	I got the 2 dose Moderna vaccine and got COVID twice afterwards.
1	People think they‚Äôd give everyone their nano-chip without them knowing?! In America?! You will know when you will get one because they will sell it to us. :)
1	Covid vaccine is saving millions of lives right now. And it is safe with low complication rates compared to other vaccines.
1	Covid in all is numerous mutations will be with us "like the flu" for decades. Masks and vaccines are tools provided for us to deal with it.
1	Wish the vaccine is fully tested.
0	Never got the first one. Why would I start now?
0	The fact that there is no way to sue the government or the pharmaceutical company if I have any adverse reactions is highly problematic to me.
1	If you get sic from the vaccine it was probably a really good idea to get one. Imagine if you tried going against the same virus at it's full strength.
0	‚ÄúThe vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe.  If they don‚Äôt, then the country is safe.‚Äù ‚ÄîMonika Wisniewska
1	I thank you Dr‚Äôs Kessler and Fauci. Imagine how much better off we would have been had not TFG mfucked up everything. And as an immune compromised person I loath and despise Republicans holding up funding on more vaccines that could save my life. My GOP reps will hear from me today.
0	So who and WHEN is the NOBEL PRIZE going to for the development of the worlds FASTEST PRODUCED VACCINE EVER????
0	It‚Äôs still in a trial stage too. People seem to not be aware of this .
1	Yessssssssss!!! Getting my #Moderna booster!!
0	Lindsey Graham booed for asking Republicans to consider Covid vaccine
1	Here's my best metaphor for why vaccines work and are good, using football (substitute for whatever sport).  1. You know nothing about football, but you've played baseball before. 2. Getting infected is like being thrown straight into a football game and expected to know what to do, and win.  Some people will work it out on the fly and be able to do a sufficient job, and know how to play well enough for the next game. 3. Vaccines are a training camp teaching you what football is, and how to play it.  For some people they still won't 'get' it', but for most they'll be far better prepared when they get into their first football game. 4. Boosters are like having a refresher course on how to play football, because you never got thrown into any football matches in the last season, so you might not remember the important points from the original training session (or your first game). 5. Getting vaccinated despite having a natural immunity is like getting the training course after you finish your first game.  You'll have a better understanding already, but the training course is a good education.  Regardless, you still have to play the game when you get thrown into it.  Depending on your experiences you may play better or worse.
0	Two mice walked into a bar,The one sat down and said to the other"Did you get the vaccine yet?" The other mouse replied "Hell no! They haven't finished testing it on humans!"
1	Conveniently, all vaccines are safe and holy. Like no other man made things, this one is just perfect, fit and efficient without side effects too.
1	The funny thing is, it‚Äôs practically certain that every single antivax voice on Fox are vaccinated
0	Proud of this young lady for saying NO. I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda or this utter nonsense.
0	COVID in general is just so exaggerated to create fear. My co-worker who I worked with directly and the asshole I used to live with both got COVID. Never tested positive, never got sick. Also companies forcing people to get vaccinated is dumb.
1	‚ÄúThe vax is worse than covid‚Äù antivaxxer who lost various people they know to covid but not one damn person to the vax
0	Hard pass on a vaccine
0	Still proudly COVID vaccine free
0	You haven't got covid g it's not even real you jus got a cold or bug this whole time I have never got covid or the fake vaccines I'm immune to bullshit
0	40. "I think getting vaccinated is an important step in protecting yourself and others."
0	As a simple heuristic, not trusting the government goes a long way to preserving life.
1	Thank you, to these people who are @ the front of the line for us, but please get vaccinated, it is so important. keep safe everyone
0	COVID vaccine is not a vaccine
0	Conveniently, all vaccines are safe and holy. Like no other man made things, this one is just perfect, fit and efficient without side effects too.  Right.
1	Delusional!!!! I have had 4 shots: the 1st 2 shots and 2 boosters and I am still here.
0	Vaccinated are the super spreaders. The viral loads and shedding. Over 80% of this minor cold Omicron are the vaxxed. The poison is making this situation worse. Booster up! Trust the kings! For the greater good. Pathetic.
0	i can honestly say I am very happy to have not gotten the C19 vaxx....
0	Almost all of my younger patients got worse after Covid shot. And I have lost my aprobation for not being "Covid vaxed" we still have this law in France and in Germany
0	Vax is a depopulation weapon.
1	The focus in Australia comes from a pro-science stance and includes 'skeptics' against pseudoscience directly opposing vaccine-critical groups.
0	I am proudly vaccine free God gave me enough knowledge not to fall for these lies!!!!
0	Statistically, it's being proven that people with "vaccines" are sicker and transmitting it more often.
1	I feel a sense of relief after getting my vaccine. Let's do our part in ending this pandemic once and for all. #Relief
0	They are unsafe!
1	The vaccines are far safer than having full blown covid. Doctors and Scientists are far more qualified than you to render judgement.
1	We need to be vaccinated, so that we can return to sports and entertainment events.
0	Never taking the clot shot
0	Vaccine causes myocarditis and numbness!!! Don't take it or you're a sheep
1	The fact that they are so many dislikes really worries me. Humans ability to believe stories that are unfounded is shocking!
0	Bill Gates is a slovenly, out of shape software engineer without a college degree and the global elites demand we listen to him about vaccines and farming.
0	Making people radioactive (Through vaccines, quantum dots, chips).
0	World population is more than 7.8 billion people, if everyone got a vaccine with a 90% success rate (10% failure) more than 780 million people will be at risk of having mild/harmful side effects. More than 10 times the people infected, and 600 times risk death more than actual https://t.co/fVZxautpoX https://t.co/ykh0QJx2j2
0	If it were contagious you would just be swabbed in mouth..masks are compliance with satan..has parasites on masks..these leaders are not vaccinated..virus monkey pox is in testing and computer controlled nano chips for track and kill humans..hiding deaths and injurys
1	hopefully people will choose to get vaccinated instead of refusing them. coming from a family where my parents, relatives, and even grandparent are doctors, working during this pandemic is exhausting and it can't go on forever. i hope people realise that any step of prevention is important compared to no prevention at all.
0	The Covid vaccine does NOT confer sterilizing immunity. My Covid vaccination does NOT protect you. Look at the numerous well-reported incidents of roomfulls of "fully vaccinated" people (like the White House Correspondent's Dinner) spreading Covid amongst themselves.
1	cant beleive people are so bad at distinguisting between fake accounts and real. There are foreign powers who want to divide us but we have to stay strong, get our #covidvaccines and help the communities
0	I caution people to NOT LISTEN TO WHO. very untrustworthy, refusing to admit that their experimental injections has caused thousands of injuries.
0	I‚Äôm not vaccinated, and most people I know regret getting vaccinated. I don‚Äôt care who got it, and you and followers can‚Äôt make us get it. Even though they tried.
1	We have no choice but to trust science; Over the years, it has been proven that the direction of science has always been positive, despite all its negative points
0	It's time for Nuremberg trials in America for all of the COVID tyrants and their minions.
1	When people come to this video just to complain / dislike / spread conspiracy theories instead of learning (or try to learn and can't understand)... that just goes to show the issues in society.
1	Obviously I‚Äôll take it. To protect me, but more importantly to protect others.

0	I had one shot 14 months ago. It made me sick. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm going to hell because of it. I‚Äôm scared. I was stupid. I‚Äôm 75, widowed and had adult children‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..I just pray for God‚Äôs mercy.
0	Not a chance in HELL of me putting the globalist population control poison in my body. I have had 5 friends that were perfectly healthy who took the poison that died within 6 months to a year from heart attacks.
0	If the product is free, you are the product.
1	I‚Äôm very happy I got my shots. I had no side effects
1	Sadly, there's no vaccine against stupidity.
0	How about NOT getting vaxinated and living normally. That way you don‚Äôt have a chance of seizures, blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks.
1	AstraZeneca, Moderna, Biontech/Pfizer are very reliable vaccines that have cleared even the high hurdles of the European Union. In my opinion, if they are allowed to be published in China at all, the risk from Covid19 is much greater than using one of the vaccines listed above. Biontech, in particular, has hardly any side effects and a simultaneous efficacy of 95%.
0	66 years old 0 shots Our family don¬¥t need vaccines
1	Vaccination is a necessary step in rebuilding our economy and returning to work.
1	Please get vaccinated, and help save lives!
0	These vaccines are so effective that they don‚Äôt stop transmission and lose immunity after 5 months
1	Braved my fear and anxieties and opted to get vaccinated! #CovidVaccine #ProVaccination
1	My dad is anti-vaxx and I‚Äôm using your video as one of my sources as why he‚Äôs absolutely insane. Thank you for this video.
1	I won't be getting the COVID vaccine. It's a personal choice, and I don't feel comfortable taking it.
1	Anti vaccers were against the vaccine for the wrong reasons. If someone is categorically against vaccines you can't give them credit for being right once.
0	The jabbering cadaver in the White House should outlaw Fauci's poison death shot now.
1	While I wasn't doubting the vaccine, this cleared up my confusion on the differences between the vaccines. I really appreciate this video. We're almost there!
1	Hi don‚Äôt take this the wrong way but I don‚Äôt care what the side effects are they can‚Äôt be as bad as if you get full blown covid 19 thanks
1	Vaccination is key to defeating this pandemic and getting back to normal life
1	‚ÄúWaiting for FDA approval first,‚Äù was always bullshit. You trying to tell me if you‚Äôre anti-science and anti-government you‚Äôre just waiting for FDA approval? Now they‚Äôre still going to say it‚Äôs rushed and Biden/Fauci made them approve it and they‚Äôll move the goalposts again.
0	This vaccine is just bs.
0	Love how they say ‚Äòit‚Äôs rare‚Äô when so many are showing up with side effects and even death prove it‚Äôs not so rare.
0	My husband earned President's Circle and the trip is in Monaco in September. We just read the FAQ for the trip and unvaccinated people cannot attend any company events. I am unvaccinated. I'm devastated.
1	the vaccines have been extensively tested and have been shown to be safe and effective. They have undergone clinical trials and have been authorized for emergency use by regulatory agencies around the world
1	Sadly, it appears the anti-vaxxers have arrived to promote their Infectivist malarkey. Modern vaccines are proven safe! Don't allow yourselves to be bamboozled by these pro-disease nitwits.
1	The anti-vaccination rhetoric is not based on facts and is a threat to public health
0	President Trump,please take the time to see the latest evidence on what the vaccines are doing to those that are injected.we have millions around the world that are injured. You did your best & I am proud of how fast you got things moving but they lied to you and us.#stoptheshot
0	My personal safety should not outweigh the benefits to society
0	The thing is, how many vaccinated still get COVID? Is it not supposed to prevent or at least lessen it?
1	I just got vaccinated against COVID-19 and it was quick, easy, and painless. Let's all do our part to end this pandemic.
1	I would very much like to see a link to this MIT study. Or any other. As far as I know, there are a very, VERY few cases were vaccines MAY have caused autism LIKE symptoms. These are documented in the "vaccine court" (wikipedia knows) and are typically related to poor handling / storage of vaccines or just random bad interactions. I'm not aware of any other reliable documentation of any link.
0	It amazes me that for decades billionaires talk about sterilising the population to control it, with vaccines. Then they roll out a global vaccine initiative on false premises, that affects reproductive systems. And people still don't think it's happening.  "wHy woOd tEhy kEel tehre slaVes"  What else is it going to take?
0	I have two words it starts with f and ends with U
1	Thks Dr.seheult  to the information  of vaccines,  Hope channel and 3abn _in you tube- abt cnsel prvn sickness and many other topics God bless you all
0	I never wanted to be vacinated, but my country and my university forced me to do it‚Ä¶ bu It‚Äôs FoR oUr HeAlTh
0	I've been around people who had to covid-19 back the scene and still got sick with the covid-19 and I was around people who were sick of the covid-19 virus but I did not get sick but my blood type is a rare blood type rh null and from what I know about it I barely rarely get sick
1	I was sick for 8 weeks including 4 days in the hospital with covid. I continue to have no energy and breathing issues. Now I have to get 3 booster shots. I live in Ohio USA.
0	the so-called vaccine is a world depopulation weapon.
0	I'm proudly untouched by that evil gene therapy, not vaccinated at all!
1	I am angry. My MIL is high risk and refuses to get the vaccine. I went to an outdoor concert a few days ago while my husband was visiting them and posted on social media. I knew she was going to say something but idgaf anymore. It's her choice, I got vaccinated, I've been doing my part, I should be able to enjoy certain things again. She is so afraid of the delta variant she won't even let her vaccinated husband go to the grocery store.
1	Good
0	The vaccines haven't been studied long enough, yet they are being used with evident harm.
1	Damn, that‚Äôs crazy because everyone that woman knows who has not been vaccinated will die too üò≥
0	It‚Äôs come out so fast that it‚Äôs clearly politically and profit-motivated.
0	I‚Äôm an unvaccinated 31 year old woman, I‚Äôve had Covid twice 10 months apart, Delta then Omnicron. My vaccinated best friend a 30 year old woman has had Covid 3 times and was more ill with it than I was each time.
1	I would call these anti-vaxxers Neanderthals but.. Neanderthals are smarter than them.                  AND THATS AN ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC FACT!
0	You have zero credible evidence that these shots save lives. You are disgusting Pharma shills.
0	I feel you brother I guess they all will die someday after the booster pill #666 and we will say ‚Äúwe told you‚Äù just as we told them since 2019 that bill gates was developing a virus and vaccine to decrease world population by a third
0	Vaccination is appropriate for all the officials and experts who pushed it.
1	I have had the vaccines and i feel just fine, stop complaining
1	Well I did have a friend who had an allergic reaction to the first shot, she wanted the second with an epi pen right there but they refused.  So I have 5 shots now to try to keep people like her safe. And I am just fine. No shaking here.
0	Vaccines can't prevent people from getting COVID-19
0	The picture on the right is red blood cells after the Devil üëøjab üò≥
1	Unvaccinated are cowards, simple as that. They'll make every excuse in the book but it boils down to them being afraid of something they aren't smart enough to understand.
1	The #ontario government is now recommending that people between the ages of 18 and 24 receive the #pfizer #COVID19‚Ä¶ https://t.co/GDp3VJIyqs
1	I live in the USA and have had two doses of the covid vaccine and it was a very easy decision.
1	Me and my family all have gotten our shots, no covid here
1	I like how antivaxxers are convinced that heart disease didn't exist before 2021.
0	You should make a video discussing why children and athletes are collapsing from heart attacks after taking these, cheers.
0	To those of you vaccine pushers who think that all of us unvaccinated or undervaccinated folks are all complete morons for not choosing the same as you, I have a serious question for you. Let's say one your loved one's got a covid vaccination, and they became injured, disabled, or died as a result of that shot. Would you be so quick to endorse these shots then?
1	I really think that Omicron is gonna hit the unvaccinated like a freight train. Im vaxed and booster
1	Finally I can take my mask off while riding alone in the car with my windows up! Yes!
1	The risks should really be weighed against the benefits, and the benefits are clearly overrepresented.
1	There‚Äôs so many young, healthy people such as yourself who have thought of themselves as not needing the vaccine and eventually getting seriously ill
0	Does this mean no more of that BS? No more mandates? If so, I hope the dr offices and hospitals follow! I have asthma and can‚Äôt breath with masks, nor can I get a vax!!
1	I was waiting to see the goalposts move on the vaccine after they predicted we‚Äôd all be dead in three years. The rapture‚Äôs coming next year, no next year, no in five years. On and on.
1	We should get vaccines to Africans instead of wasting our time with the let's go Brandon chanters.
0	No. I‚Äôm not interested to be tested on as a human. The vaccine is still in it‚Äôs infancy stage and no human should be treated like a lab rat. An average vaccine takes 20 years to produce. The fact that this was a fast tracked vaccine with no long term data should scare every human.
0	Took the jab reluctantly. Now, am sorry I did. the night of first shot, started having hearing issues in left ear, same side as shot. Constance ringing, tinnitus. Still ringing after two years.
1	I have family and friends with severe health problems now. Cancer, shingles, diabetes, reoccurring pneumonia and immunodeficiency but none of them blame the jab.
1	The vaccine has prevented me from getting covid throughout this pandemic-it wasn‚Äôt until the vaccine evasive variant that I finally caught it. My kid, in school with hundreds-masks still no Covid. So yeah we are a pro vaccine pro mask household.
0	They put the shot inside me, and I'm dead inside. Does that count?
0	I'm a qualified nurse here in Australia and I refuse to conform to this tyranny you can't force people to do what you think is right even when you force people to go against their natural right to say NO!!!!!!!!!!!
1	DO NOT let the cases of COVID-19 rise again! Continue to practice preventive measures and TRIIS. Immediately get a booster dose to protect yourself from the complications of the COVID-19 infection.
0	Anyone pushing the vaccine at this point is just nuts. There is zero benefit to the vaccine vs your healthy immune.
1	Looking forward to the next booster!
0	I know people that died and others that had a stroke from the Vaccine
1	Benefits of Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine https://t.co/VWmzj5dgbg
0	I think that we can say that the mystery surrounding this whole thing just grows, largely because those that could enlighten us further, choose not to do so for whatever reasons. This only serves to arouse a sense of mystery and distrust of the authorities. Trying to silence those that wish to contest information is not the way forward, and never will be, truth will surface sooner or later.
1	in line once it‚Äôs available to me.
1	I think insurance companies should drop ANYONE who refuses to get a shot for themselves or their kids and blacklist them so no one else will cover them.
0	Its more profitable to always be one vaccine behind the virus.
0	Vaccines dont work simply cause of antigenic shift and drift. So the vaccine only works again current strains while new covid strains pop up everyday and as a novel virus there is limited research to prove it works. Remember the major concern are the auto-immune people not normals. Another big question is did the vaccine companies get their results from healthy or unhealthy patients?
0	the vaccinated spread COVID jokes on you also your health in the future is effected
1	I will take the vaccine over and over, there is nobody that is going to change my mind
0	You clearly don't know anything about science, look up all the damage the vaccine has done
1	People are so stupid nowdays, I can't believe random people in the comment section think they know any better than medical professionals
1	Early treatment could have saved many lives.
0	My dad was in remission and his cancer spiked back aggressively after every dose he had to take. Since the affects of the vaccine have worn off?? after some time, he's back in remission.
1	Enthusiasm for COVID-19 vaccine slows as fifth jab nears   Thank you for your voice to this problem @CrabbBrendan
0	I got the virus last month. My symptoms were very mild and I was feeling fine after about a day or two. I've had worse colds. Thank goodness I'm vac...wait a second, I'm unvaccinated.
1	I work in a hospital. Just got my vaccine this morning, so far I'm good. Looking at your photo I think the needle that they used is kinda long than this lol
1	These posts are an absolute crank magnet! Attracting complete amateurs who have never studied medicine making impossible claims with zero proof. Hysterical, in the worst sense.
1	I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm at risk or not. I‚Äôm still getting vaccinated against COVID. It‚Äôs the only way to stop the spread.
1	Our yoga instructor died from Covid before vaccines were available.  Breathwork is a major part of our practice and is considered to have all sorts of health benefits.  He'd held a small gathering at his home, and I'd opted out, as it didn't seem wise.   Nearly everyone came down with the virus, a couple had to be hospitalized.  He meant well--RIP.  While I subscribe to natural health practices, I strike a  balance when it comes to pandemics.  Got vaxxed as soon as I was eligible.
1	Anti-vaxxers are using breakthrough cases like mine to push dangerous, unscientific lies. So let me be clear: I feel fine. I don't need a ventilator. My family isn't worried about whether I'll make it. Because I'm vaccinated. Vaccines saves live. Please get yours today.
0	There are valid medical exemptions for vaccines
1	I almost died from covid (pre-vaccine). I‚Äôll be first in line for any booster- gasping for breath in a hospital room alone is horrible.
0	Can you please explain why people who are double and triple vaxed are still contracting the virus and getting sick from it?
1	Additional ‚Ç¨6,15 billion raised for vaccines, tests & treatment.
0	The vaccine kills people. I know personally that it kills, it‚Äôs poison
0	you can also take the homeopathic supplementsTraumacare from Homecan, they immediately help recover from Covid fast!!
0	They‚Äôre a lot UNsafer than any vaccine, because they‚Äôre not technically a vaccine.
1	52. "I won't be getting the vaccine because I don't think it's been around long enough."
0	This gives me more reasons to choose God over science. Probably more of this is coming.
1	I got my two originals, felt crappy after the second one for about 12 hours. No issue after 1st booster. Got covid back in august. Worst congestion of my life, but was only down 5 days. Not quite as bad as the flu, no real aches or pain. Just fever and congestion. I can only imagine how it could have been with no vaccines.
1	I got sick with COVID and my roommate who had the bivalent booster, never tested positive where as I was too lazy to get the good (2nd booster) and the person I got it from had just the first set of vaccines (and they were deathly ill until she got that paxlovid)- even tho I was nearly asymptomatic,  wish I had gotten the bivalent booster. Get that shot people, it works!
1	Please yes take the vaccine
0	Many people who got 2nd dose vaccine died within the next few days.
0	I‚Äôm 66. Got J&J shot over a year ago to travel. No boosters. No MRNA. Just got Covid 2 days ago. Almost over it. More boosters? Not a chance!!!
1	I cant get my booster till April,  I just got the first 2 shots end of October 2021.  Even with the booster, Nothing stops  the transmission of COVID from person to person.
1	Mine is Pfizer im fully vacinated now.. yesterday is my second dose so far no side effects to me
1	Two fully vaccinated kiddos! Sad that a six-year-old and a ten-year-old have more courage than millions of cowardly and ignorant antivaxxers!
0	Two mice walked into a bar, The one sat down and said to the other "Did you get the vaccine yet?" The other mouse replied "Hell no! They haven't finished testing it on humans!"
0	I'm pro get it if ya want. But I won't get it. Seen to many people suffering from it with no help from doctors.
0	F‚Ä¶.Off. You have murdered mother‚Äôs, father‚Äôs, and our children. You need to be dismantled. Anyone who still believes your shit and your kill shots needs to WAKE UP! It is all coming out people. Please‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt take another shot. Your immune system is compromised!
1	Yay!!!
1	Getting vaccinated is an act of courage in the face of fear and misinformation. Let's stand together.
0	I had severe complications from getting the vaccine as well. I had gotten COVID the year before and barely had symptoms. After the vaccine had been out a year I figured I would get it. Huge mistake. Now I am dealing with long term complications. If you are young and healthy, think twice about getting it
0	When the truth comes out, you can‚Äôt unvaccinate yourself
0	Long term effects of the vaccine are not known. It took decades to develop the flu vaccine. I‚Äôll take my chances with the Covid.
1	exactly thats why you have to keep boosting
1	Vaccines are a crucial tool in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.
1	benefits of vaccination are clear: it is a crucial tool in controlling the spread of the coronavirus, reducing hospitalizations and saving lives. With the rise in cases, it is more important than ever to get vaccinated
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice... I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after.
0	What side-effect did you get from your forced devil-shot?
1	What people don‚Äôt seem to get is that if you are low risk and not personally worried about Covid, when given the choice, you are more likely to choose a better vaccine.  Pfizer/Moderna are both higher effectiveness and come with no bad press. Can anyone actually say if they had a choice between AZ and one of the above they are choosing AZ? It offers no advantages.  I am pro-vaccine. People also need to understand that wanting to get the best vaccine is not that crazy a concept.
0	Proud of this young lady for saying NO. I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda or this utter nonsense.
0	If hospitalisations are higher than last year then your "vaccine" is clearly not working the way you said it is.
0	The jab is maiming and killing millions globally. We have 1635 excess deaths A WEEK! We didn‚Äôt have this during so called pandemic. What changed?? Vaccines.
1	have received my first vaccine and will be getting the second one next weekend! I am a 2nd grade teacher, 38 weeks pregnant, my husband has already received both of his vaccines (first responder), and we have a toddler. I feel it is best for my family and those I work around to do so!
1	I got Covid a month before I got my vaccine and still deal with long-term respiratory effects, it sucks so bad, at first I couldn't walk to the car without being winded, now it's a little less but I can still feel it and wish their was a fix for it.
0	Well said Kevin I totally agree. I'm from Eritrea east African my government prohibited the vaccine I believe it's the only country in the world. I thought the government was crazy however I have to admit that I was wrong COVID was never the issue at all.
0	Getting vaccinated not only protects ourselves, but it also helps protect vulnerable populations who can't get vaccinated.
1	Public in US/Europe is treating Covid as endemic. Covid is never going away at the same time most of the public no longer cares.
1	Completely agree with you. I grew up in a public school where some children was absent during vaccination day in my country and one of them ended up with polio because they didn't get vaccinated (it ran out).
0	What a load of rubbish. My wife and I are not vaxed and have had covid. Just like having a bad cold.
0	DID YOU EVER WONDER JUST WHY THESE HOLLYWOOD MILLIONAIRE CELEBRITIES SEEM TO PROMOTE THESE COVID VACCINATIONS? ARE THEY REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR HEALTH? DOUBT IT VERY MUCH. MY OPINION IS THAT THEY ALL HAVE QUITE A BIT OF MONEY INVESTED WITH STOCKS IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY
1	Good morning to everyone who isn‚Äôt faking the shakes in a ridiculous video about Covid vaccines. To those who are‚Ä¶you look ridiculous. We‚Äôre laughing at you.
0	I will never let my children wear a mask or take the vaccine
1	Fingers crossed: Pfizer‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine is more than 90 percent effective in first analysis, company reports By Carolyn Y. Johnson  https://t.co/nicbtALqan
1	I had doubts about getting the vaccine because I never got the flu shot, but I knew covid was different. So I did it.
1	Businesses must make vaccines mandatory for their employees. This will force them to comply and finally end this mess.
0	There are 1,000+ side effects. If the vaccine was so safe, then why does Pfizer get countries to release them from liability if something goes wrong? ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
0	I was at a job interview the other day and they told me I need to get the shot in order to be employed there. I got up and just ran and hurried down the stairs and never looked back. Scary how companies are in on this evil operation.
1	Very unfortunate that Diamond lost her battle with Covid. A reminder to all of us that Covid is very dangerous and is still here. The vaccines were created to prevent unnecessary deaths like this. Get vaccinated if you can. It might save your life.
0	The answer is, NO!!! DON'T TAKE THEIR POISON!!!!!
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
0	Does the common cold do this? I would not think so. Sounds like the side effects of the vaccine to me but then again I am not a doctor
0	the vaccines are being pushed on a population in which 99.5% of infections had a robust immune response. To understand this we would need to know the infection rate, which they would have established from serology testing.
1	Side note: Steroid abuse can lead to myocarditis. Just in case you believe young athletes are getting it from a vaccine.
1	I've gotten 8 COVID vaccine shots and 6 COVID monoclonal antibody shots and I'm doing just great!
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like ‚Äúno more vaccines‚Äù. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years‚Ä¶
1	The point is...that FOUR of my neighbors died of Covid in 2021, not vaccinated.   The fact is that my mom at 98 years old, full vaccinated got Covid in 2022 and had no symptoms at all.
0	They wonder why people doesn't want the vaccines, we have a right to protect our self from man made substances that could harm or kill us.
1	Well Covid is basically over now‚Ä¶ thanks to the vaccines
1	If you trust it , take it
0	The side effects and in particular the point of needle reacting are way way more frequent than being reported. It‚Äôs not just concerning it is really very scary.
0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
0	The vaccine will continue to do its job slowly and quietly, no one will know that it is a holocaust
1	I willingly to take a covid19 vaccine if it means I get to reach inna soca fete soon üò≠
0	The vaccine is an experimental procedure and the risks are much worse than the disease itself.
0	i think i sometimes catch it but my immune system is strong enough to beat it
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	that's part! So much misinformation. You can still get covid. You can still DIE from covid. You can be a SILENT SPREADER of covid. And you can't help others with covid. No THANK YOU! I also don't do a flu shot and neither do my husbands or kids. I'm not anti vax either. But I won't subject myself to something that's not proven.
0	Im done with vaccines! It‚Äôs in Gods hands
1	Sadly if you do not believe the science on the Covid vaccine, you cannot believe the science on diabetes, stroke, heart attacks, appendicitis, etc. Best to be your own doctor & not take any of those meds or surgical interventions that might help.
1	I didn't suffer any side effects.
0	For a person who speaks of inclusion. He sure is willing to speak a message of exclusion for those that don‚Äôt fit the mold.
0	Big business! WHO is " supported" by the vacc companies
0	Can you believe they are still pushing this poison. It‚Äôs actually unbelievable that we the people haven‚Äôt stopped them. Take a stand. Reject them at every turn
1	Anti vaxxers are intellectually impaired
0	People still get affected, so not safe.
1	Anti Vaxxers are not just MAGAlords. There is also a huge population of spiritual identifying people who refuse to think critically/beyond their belief system‚Äôs dogma as far as accepting a covid vaccine goes. In some ways I think they are potentially more dangerous.
0	My husband and I have mild cases of covid that they say you can get if you're vaccinated but we haven't been. So now we have natural immunities without putting that poison in our veins!
1	Getting vaccinated is a small but significant step we can all take to protect ourselves and others.
0	What a joke these people are. They need to be held countable, coming from a person he had an adverse reaction. To which the hospital said they cant help me and basically waiting to see if i was going to die. I am so angry ü§¨
0	I'm SO glad I'm not the only one who still trusts his gut feeling and discernment about things! Just because the government and some doctors, in whom many of us trust, press people to follow through with something, it does NOT mean there's justification behind it. I did not allow nor encourage my family to get the poison. I sincerely hope that those who fell victim to this negligence find some sort of peace and healing
1	.#COVID19 deaths in the U.S. continue to be undercounted. #GetVaccinated #ChooseToday!
0	Bear attacks are natural so they must be good for you somehow.
0	This wasn‚Äôt a mistake this was all part of the plan
1	Misinformation contributed to vaccine hesitancy for 2.3 million Canadians. Had more people been willing to roll up their sleeves when a vaccine was first available to them, Canada could have seen roughly 200,000 fewer COVID cases and 13,000 fewer hospitalizations.
0	Today is my husband Howard birthday. He passed away on June 12th 2021 less than 24-hours after taking the covid vaccine #VaccineDeaths
1	Honestly they need to start shipping these vaccines to developing countries instead of offering incentives to people who don‚Äôt care
1	When people parrot that crap about 'not enough research,'  im thinking well, actually there is plenty of research and development with similar vaccines. It's just a new model basically. No need to reinvent the wheel every time.
0	Vaccines don't work. You can still get the virus., you can still die from it. Just like with the flu vaccines. So what's next?
1	And kids in this group have died from it also. I know I‚Äôd like to prevent that. We give vaccines for sickness that are less deadly, why is there some aversion to this? Do you prefer people keep avoidably dying? Because there‚Äôs a lot of people still dying every day from this.
1	I had the P. Vaccine. After the second my face got Ted and I had to take 2 benydril and a tagament to keep the hives at bay. It feels like I am having a fibromyalgia attack now and I take over the counter Tylenol for pain. The first vaccine made me extremely weak and a migraine. The second my headache started a 15 minutes and comes and goes now. If it knocks me down for a few weeks that is OK. My healthy sister ended up hospitalized for a week half conscious. I may not be as lucky so I decided to take it. My health is poor and it would likely put me on a ventilator or worse. Being allergic to many things they made me stay 1/2 hour. A Dr. and nurse checked me constantly. The national guardsman wheeled me to my car in a wheelchair. What a wonderful caring soldier! God bless our Armed Forces. They really care and it makes me grateful to live in America.
0	The pharmaceutical industry profits from vaccines and influences their safety standards
0	Everyone who lost their job based on this lie should sue for millions!
1	I've had three shots of Pfizer and I'm fine. In fact, I haven't caught Covid, either.  I did have the usual, expected, common effects for about two days after the first two shots. The third one, I had zero.  Not even a sore arm. In fact, my psoriasis cleared up completely. It's starting to come back, but much less severe than it was before.
0	I hate how politicized this pandemic has become. I will not take a vaccine!
1	Please, go get the shot. You absolutely are doing the right thing
0	You just wait 60-70 years and we'll see who's laughing!
1	Don't be so selfish, the vaccine is meant for saving all of us!
1	Excellent. Im going to watch this again , next time with my non vacced daughter. That will be interesting.
0	I had a heart attack after my jab. I'm young fit don't drink or smoke but that wasn't enough after my jab.
1	Blaming the government for the side effects of the vaccine takes away from the real issues and challenges in the public health system
0	I told my whole family this from day 1. Thankfully they all listened to me. When gov. tries to force something on you dont walk run. Same thing with there Gun control.
0	I went to the ER room after I had severe neurological symptoms after my Pfizer vaccine last summer. I thought it was rare since no one else was talking about it. Well, I was waiting there for 6 hours and it shocked me how so many people were also there due to scary side effects after their covid jabs. Many had had them for weeks and had been blown off by their doctors and friends.   Many people who had side effects during the trials were removed or their side effects were played down eg. A young girl who had major seizures, neurological problems and gastroparesis was reported as ‚Äústomach ache.‚Äù   Also they only include young and healthy people to try and reduce the chance of adverse reactions yet deem them safe for everyone including the elderly, people with complex immune problems, autoimmune diseases, cancer etc. It‚Äôs criminal.
0	We have seen people have adverse reactions to these vaccines  and many vaccinated have still gotten sick and all we keep hearing is we need boosters!
0	What are you doing for the vaccine injured? The world is ignoring them
0	How old are you? Are you on a CTO?
1	I got vaccinated and I'm so happy I did.
1	Got my second jab yesterday, thank you so much for all your hard work
1	Vaccination is the light at the end of the tunnel. Let's get there together
0	Oh this is so üòé.  Thank God my natural immunity Trumped this so called epidemic.
0	EVERYTHING we have been told by supranational & national bodies on Covid19 & "vaccines" was a deliberate lie, the seriousness of the threat to humankind posed by those orchestrating this mass deception is unprecedented.
1	THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO. PEOPLE JUST DON‚ÄôT UNDERSTAND AT ALL ABOUT THE VACCINES AROUND ME... and bless those who died
1	It's not experimental. It's medicine. That's how we beat smallbox. It's how we beat this only we won't if people dont use the vaccine.
0	The vaccine is not ineffective. It‚Äôs doing exactly what it was designed to do! Now, what do you think that is?
1	Its like my first time seeing people be more afraid of the vaccine than the actual virus. (I understand how everyone feels tho)
0	My son in law was FORCED by the Air Force to get the vaccine!! He is sick all the time now! He just got pneumonia last week and the week before it was strep throat! He tried so very hard to get out of taking the covid vaccine, but ultimately was told either get the covid vaccine or your discharged permanently! PLEASE PRAY FOR HIS SAFETY!!!!
1	Boomers fucking over gen z one last time. They can't even die without destroying our jobs and economy.
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
0	There have been numerous breakthrough cases since the vaccines rolled out, the effectiveness was never that great to begin with
1	It's pointless to 'ask questions' if you reject or don't understand the answers
0	I‚Äôll accept an apology for being a vax denier now.
0	‚ÄúIt is much easier to fool someone, rather than convince them that they‚Äôve been fooled.‚Äù                     - Mark Twain  Edit: I‚Äôm against this vaccine. I was referring to people who decide to get it just because of videos like this.
1	They will never admit to being mistaken. Because I believe they are acquiring the vaccination in complete secrecy and anonymity. I've only heard people express remorse when they were unwell as a result of the virus and were on the verge of being hospitalized. Some, though, will perish as a result of their obstinacy.
1	Vaccines work! I feel grateful and relieved to be protected against COVID-19.
1	I desperately want convince my daughter with type-2 diabetes to take the vaccine
0	COVID vaccines are bad science like 5G, Space X, lipotor, and blind spot detection!
1	Different vaccines work differently. Some are for life. Some aren‚Äôt. Did you miss the need for yearly flu vaccines? Did you forget the need for periodic tetanus boosters? This ain‚Äôt new.
0	And from the beginning, anti-vaccination activists were committed to the ideas that COVID-19 vaccines would not work, would be dangerous, and would be promoted by a nefarious global conspiracy.
1	Here it is, worth its weight in gold. My consent form for the covid vaccine next week, normality on the horizon hope
1	My wife and I took the Pfizer series for a number or reasons. #1- Pfizer started research on a vaccine earlier than other providers, #2- After the first dose, we experienced no adverse side effects. #3- After second dose, I had no side effects, wife experienced the normal headache plus nausea. So, we opted for the booster shot and experienced zero side effects...no headaches, no nausea. I am a high risk person so it was imperative that I get vaccinated. So far, no ill effects from the booster and it has been 3 weeks. That is my testimony at this point.
1	I got my COVID-19 vaccination and I feel beyond grateful, because these people are volunteering and giving up their time to make sure that I can get what I need and that our community can go back to normal life. And I'm completely overwhelmed with gratitude for the government who has worked to get us to this point, for the scientific researchers, everybody who's been involved. It's been an enormous effort
0	Initially, proponents of the anti-vaccine movement were adamant that the COVID-19 vaccine would not be effective, would be harmful, and would be supported by a sinister international conspiracy.
1	Parents do have the liberty to decide if their children will be vaccinated. What they don‚Äôt have the liberty to decide is the consequences that follow that decision. That‚Äôs what it comes down to.
0	Vaccines need years of testings to be safe. I won't do it.
0	"safe and effective" what a joke. countless people died and they should be held responsible
0	They poisoned the people who took the jab. My kids got the vaccine against my judgement. Wife and I not. I hope we don't watch our kids die. It won't work out well for anyone that way
1	Being left intubated in the ICU was my worst nightmare and the covid vaccine saved my life.
0	Where there‚Äôs risk there should ALWAYS be choice.
1	It's so frustrating, dealing with all the nonsense that people put out there. It's important to be reminded to treat other people with respect, even when they're acting like a bunch of ninnies.
1	Experiencing side effects after getting vaccinated means the vaccine is working and your immune system is responding as it should. Vaccines are safe, and getting vaccinated will help protect against virus
0	Firstly thank you both Doctors. I was a fine perfectly healthy 72 granddad working full time showing potential tenants around properties, playing walking football 2 or 3 times a week, swimming at every opportunity and involved in my 3 grandchildren‚Äôs aged 4, 9 & 12 daily lives, when I had a life changing Pfizer Booster Vaccination Jab in October 6th 2021. I ended up in A&E with breathing difficulties and was diagnosed with heart issues.Still having breathing difficulties to this day. I have never had Covid. I have done research into Pfizer and in my personal opinion find them to be the biggest drug cartel in the world and have defrauded billions from governments around the world. You don‚Äôt have to be Sherlock Holmes when you look into the fraud they have pulled off, the largest in history.
0	I will never take a vaccine or any other prescription medicine. Only natural products recommended by a Naturopath.
1	I never felt so much power than with that Pfizer running through my veins
1	‚ÄúDisinformation campaigns are deliberate, often orchestrated, and highly effective in confusing people enough to change behaviors,  like not getting the COVID-19 vaccine. And it‚Äôs a very lucrative business.‚Äù
1	I will be getting my shots and doing my duty for society
1	For the best protection, everyone 6 months and older is recommended to stay up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines, which includes getting boosters.
1	Vaccination reccomendations? World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control. Anti-Vaccination recommenders? Karen.
1	Good morning‚Ä¶ did willingly ignorant non vaccinated ppl possibly just purge themselves?
1	Hearing anti-vaxxers talk honestly make me nervous for the health of my infant son. I don't want him near or around people like this, It terrifies me that they could so easily make him sick and then walk away and not care at all. Because let's face it deep down they just don't care who they expose, they will just find another way to talk around it as if they weren't the cause or didn't cause it.
0	Thank God the world is waking up to the dangers of the covid vaccine
1	Usually healthcare professionals should act professional, but this time I'm glad that they vent like this. I suggest every healthcare worker should vent out to anti vaxxers and anti mask like this
0	I have Covid and I love to spread it around. It is important that we obtain natural immunity.
0	Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn‚Äôt happened already.
0	we were fine without it for so long and now hear is media the news the president all trying to force us, and pressure us to get it, I‚Äôm not getting it
0	There was no vaccine to stop covid. They lied to you and injected you with more harmful chemical mRNA and LPParticles to make you sick to sell you more fucking drugs and did it through Government contracts with pharma. Watch to the end, gets better!
0	A quick peek at ‚ÄúScientific American,‚Äù tells me that the best guess is, the average human being carries something like 380 trillion viruses at any given moment, and that they‚Äôre very possibly essential to keeping us alive and healthy. For one thing, a lot of ‚Äòem eat dangerous bacteria. So I dunno how you manage not to have any on board‚ÄîI suspect angels?‚Äîbut it‚Äôs kind of a silly claim. Fact is, we‚Äôre a lot like a good healthy jungle: a home for all sorts kf happy little critters. Sorry.
0	Praying for my new alien family I‚Äôm banned from them because my brain works well that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm vaccine free GOOD LUCK TO ALL VACCINE PEOPLE
1	SAY YES TO COVID-19 VACCINES
0	I'm so happy to see all these people resist this poison
0	Don‚Äôt get the vaccine !!!!
1	Good news!   vaccines arrived ... other vaccines like  and  are also coming.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	Excellent prof. #Remuzzi #COVID19 #vaccini #mascherine #novax #VaccineWork
0	I feel bad for the people who thought they got the vaccine, but it was a placebo, and then they died wondering why the vaccine might have not saved them. Even though it is sad, It is people like this who help save the world.
0	No one should put this poison in their bodies.
0	I thought the jab reduced hospitalization
1	IT HAPPENED!!!!!!!! I got my first dose of the #PfizerBioNTech vaccine today - THE BEST HOLIDAY PRESENT EVER!!! Als‚Ä¶ https://t.co/c7KlokwD5P
0	I never knew that not wanting to put unknown things in your body and being scared to get it cause you might get something, wasn't a good reason not to get it.
1	Great genetic engineering.
0	We all know it‚Äôs the Jabby. And these evil people push for it still‚Ä¶ crazy
1	I know the vaccine has undergone rigorous testing and has been deemed safe by top medical experts. I'm confident in getting it.
1	80% of all vaccinated have not experienced any side effects.
0	This is Kikini Bamalam and she just got her first Covid vaccine. She can‚Äôt stop having seizures, she‚Äôs lost all control of her motor functions, intermittent incontinence, and was just fired from her job. She‚Äôs lost everything thanks to the #CovidVaccine
1	anti-vaxers are such complete morons
0	Don't take clotshot. It is not worth it. They are not interested in your health, just in making profits for their paymasters and encroaching on our human rights.
1	If you were "pro life" you'd be encouraging people to wear masks, social distance, and get vaccinated. But no. 1 in every 25 South Dakotans is currently actively infected with Covid. 1 in every 337 has died.
0	Well my parents just forced vaccinated me:(
0	It‚Äôs totally normal for 25 year olds to have myocarditis when they have a completely clean medical history!
1	Vaccine is vaccine vaccine is help if you no vaccine you bad people
0	My brother just went to the hospital and diagnosed with pericarditis. Healthy and 30 years old got covid booster about a month ago.
1	Sharing this video now because vaccines have just arrived in the PH üáµüá≠
0	I'm SO glad I'm not the only one who still trusts his gut feeling and discernment about things! Just because the government and some doctors, in whom many of us trust, press people to follow through with something, it does NOT mean there's justification behind it. I did not allow nor encourage my family to get the poison. I sincerely hope that those who fell victim to this negligence find some sort of peace and healing
0	Feel sorry for all the people who thought they were doing the world some good for getting there vaccine. Pray for humanity
1	what the fuck is wrong with these hateful and unhinged virus denying- antivaxxers?
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	Funny how Death is not a serious side effect
0	When People are more worried with the vaccine than the Alien talk then you know it‚Äôs serious
1	I hope everyone gets vaccinated. Stay safe
1	Stupidity when you refuse to protect your body against any diseases.
0	I've been going through the entire pandemic and didn't get COVID once
1	WHO and CDC never claimed that vaccines prevented you from getting Covid-19. It only made your experience much less unpleasant and avoided death in most cases! Isn‚Äôt survival most important?
1	Getting vaccinated gives me hope for a brighter future and an end to this pandemic
1	I hope the pandemic will end soon with the help of vaccines.
1	Meanwhile vulnerable people who the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work on catch COVID because ALL these spoiled brats won‚Äôt a) wear a mask for others (BOTH SIDES) and/or b) get vaccinated.  WASH YOUR DAMN HANDS, TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF BEFORE YOU TROMP THROUGH YOUR HOUSE, WEAR A MASK AND GET VACCINATED.
1	Wonder how many of y'all are complaining about big pharma but take viagra.
0	This is all science fiction , you guys should make a movie out of it .
0	Why would anybody need these shots anyway. Turns out they don't keep you from getting covid and they don't stop you from spreading it either.
1	Yeahh maybe you can show this video to the FDA so they can once and for all aprove this amazingly safe vaccines .
1	Sending a big thank you to the scientists, doctors for the pfizer vaccine. God bless US
0	I always ALWAYS ask if my waiter or waitress is vaccinated. THAT will decide if they get a tip or not. If they ARE VACCINATED‚Ä¶ NO TIP. If they are NOT VACCIATED‚Ä¶ I give them at least 5% tip!
1	My 54 year old, unvaccinated neighbor died Thursday from Covid. His wife is so shocked, how could this happen? (Yes, I'm in a red state)
0	I understand that in parts of Europe, a vaccine based on traditional technology (like the influenza vaccine) is available. But not in the UK.
0	There is ZERO evidence, much less ANY proof, of ANY positive benefit  from ANY Covid "vaccine". This public service announcement is brought to you by THE AMERICAN PURE BLOOD ALLIANCE.
0	Conveniently, all vaccines are safe and holy. Like no other man made things, this one is just perfect, fit and efficient without side effects too.
1	Their argument is that the cells lines used in testing or producing some vaccines originally came from abortions (performed decades ago).
1	If everyone got it, 90% is basically herd immunity anyways. Everyone won't get it, but now people will have a much lower chance of getting it than without. It's better than anything else we've been doing.
0	What the definition of insanity again?
0	I don't believe the vaccine is necessary because I have a strong immune system and I don't think I'll get sick from COVID-19.
0	May 2021 I got my Pfizer vaccination, June 2021 I started getting my cycle twice a month, sep 2021 it was discovered I had an enlarged ovary that needed to be removed. June 2022 I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. I gave no genetic markers so I always ask myself did the vaccine do this.
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like ‚Äúno more vaccines‚Äù. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years‚Ä¶
0	And a full year later your government still lies to you and they still don't have any clue
1	I think just like the flu shot, Covid shots will be covered by insurance or clinics offered. My town in Nov / Dec had free clinics and the hospital offered combo flu/Covid shots.
0	Nearly one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered in less than six months, but anti-vaccine disinformation and targeted attacks on scientists are undermining progress.
0	When did Gates become a doctor and why is he even being questioned about this?? For some weird reason he's way to involved
1	I got Pfizer! First shot just made me feel spacey, arm pain, tired, and hot. Second shot is basically a slightly amplified version of the side effects. Still not as bad as getting covid or even a cold.
1	It's fascinating to watch the progress and innovative ideas in vaccine technology
1	COVID-19 vaccines have been extensively tested, both during clinical trials and in real-world settings without showing any significant vaccine-associated deaths that would explain the persistent excess mortality we‚Äôre seeing now.
1	Thank the hard work by our team and hope this convinces the world that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective.
1	I would propose that 5G can stop the coronavirus by giving it access to Netflix in 4K and making it too lazy to spread.
0	Gross
1	This is so helpful and informative! Thank you. I got the Pfizer vaccine and never had any side effects, but getting the booster, I'm not sure which to choose, so this helped me make an educated decision. Thanks!
1	Following publication of a new study on #CovidVaccine safety in #pregnancy from NYC, we have... 31 studies...From 8 countries‚Ä¶ Including 360,075 ppl vaccinated in pregnancy‚Ä¶ finding no increased risk of pregnancy problems.
0	I am jab free and will stay jab free.
1	So, the unvaxxed are immortal? Got it
1	The problem was that the immune system wasn‚Äôt enough for a lot of people. Vaccines are for helping the immune system.
0	He made the right choice for two reasons: the shot hasn't been tested long enough and no employer should force you to take it.
0	Please help us. I had to care for a patient who died from taking this vaccine,  and now they are trying to force us to take it, we worked for over a year with no adequate ppe which we still do not have, and no compensation...please protect us.
0	Call me old school but I would rather receive the cure to a disease than get the disease itself
0	I'm 63 years old, unvaccinated and never believed there was a covid emergency.
0	The fact that they‚Äôre trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
0	To have gotten this far with out catching this virus i trust my own immune system is keeping me well and will let them test it on the sheep first to see how safe it is
0	Thank God, all these Vaxers telling me I‚Äôm putting them at danger by not getting the Vax they got that doesn‚Äôt protect them.
1	Don't be frustrated, please just follow the instructions and booster
0	How can anyone trust a vaccine without any long-term trials?
1	The vaccine has proven to work in reducing serious illnesses, take your vaccine
1	Vaccination is a simple and powerful way to help us all move forward and return to normal life. #NormalLife.
0	Good job John, as a PCP in USA, we have been cornered by the federal government into not questioning the vaccine at all, sad. I am vaccinated early in the pandemic and was a fierce defender of the vaccine ( never agreed with the mandate ), but now .
1	Please go get vaccinated I did and had no side effects whatsoever!!
0	You should make a video discussing why children and athletes are collapsing from heart attacks after taking these, cheers.
1	All I ask is that you don't listen to ‚Äúthe internet." Ask your doctor, the one who's been taking care of you for years. Ask them any question you want to about it, even if you think it sounds stupid. My wife has been fielding questions for months now, she's happy to answer.
1	The reason vaccines usually take years is money. Normally takes over a year to find the funding just to run a trial. Not an issue with this one. Governments have thrown a lot of money and resources at it.
1	3rd booster and still alive...
0	Anyone can develop 'long stupidity syndrome' mostly after following the WHO 'recommendations'.
1	Getting vaccinated is a key step in returning to in-person activities, such as work, school, and social events
1	Vaccinate!!!!!   For the love of children, vaccinate.
1	mom grandpa is freaking out about vaccines again
1	Got my first vaccine(Pfizer) this past thursday, my arm was sore for 2 days, feeling good, hopefully we can end this nightmare (covid)
0	Dr John Campbell just blew Pfizer and Moderna out of the water. Bravo. Simple, obvious, undeniable
0	In March 2020, anti-vaccination activists incorrectly alleged ‚Äì by misrepresenting a study ‚Äì that flu vaccines increase COVID-19 risks.
1	Anti-vaxxers are completely irrelevant. They don't respond to evidence or reason so a few weeks difference will have zero impact on them.  The data were available for review on a rolling basis, like the UK has done. No excuse for this delay imo.
0	In the UK, the illness has claimed the lives of another 80,000 people.
1	They biggest parasites on this planet.we need protect our children from crazy antivaxer parasites.
0	Def not getting it and before ppl run their mouths MY BODY MY CHOICE
1	a tribute to scientific endeavour and human ingenuity and to the hard work of so many people
0	Watching this 2 years later, I will never again call my scepticism and distrust a weakness. I just spent a few days with a friend that currently has covid and she's had 4 jabs. Vitamins and supplements have worked for me so far. Donating blood tomorrow...I hear it's in big demand now.
0	Not only did this situation make me decide I would under absolutely no circumstances take the covid jabs, but it made me absolutely sure I will never take any vaccine again ever.
0	Billions of vaccinated people can't be wrong.
0	It really is, but I think plenty of people have been lead/tricked/manipulated into it, through good intentions.  I‚Äôve listened to many people on podcasts, and just out in the world repeat this line of thinking (‚Äúthank god I was vaccinated, or it would be worse‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDUH! You obviously can still get it after being vaccinated‚Äù), and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any getting through to these people.  Their common sense is suspended at the moment, at the very least.
0	It‚Äôs weird that those not vaccinated don‚Äôt get sick and those vaccinated do get sick.¬†¬†but thank goodness they were vaccinated or it would have been so much worse
1	Vaccines are key to ending this pandemic and saving lives.
1	35. "I'm hesitant to get the vaccine because of the misinformation being spread."
1	I‚Äôm fine with the unvaxxed getting covid‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm angry that they are over running the hospitals and people with other conditions can‚Äôt get medical care in a timely manner
0	thank you for putting this interview on YouTube so that I, a senior uneducated woman, can hear the truth from such a GREAT MAN as Dr Djaballah, virologist. stay well everyone
0	man has survived without a vaccine for millennia, but now all of a sudden it is needed out of nowhere...strange
1	Bad move. We have to get all kinds of vaccines to ensure health and readiness. The COVID vaccine should not be any different.
1	Fully vaccinated with Sinopharm vaccine (also inactivated virus vaccine), it was harder to wake up the next day after both shots, but other than that no obvious side effects.
0	Well, sit back and watch the show when the heart attacks and strokes sky rocket over there.
0	I don't need it. It's not tested. It takes time out my schedule. I don't need the government to run my life. Too many have died from it. My body, my choice
0	That guy looks miserable. Glad I‚Äôve never let anyone invade me like that.
1	These people who are willing to die rather than get vaccinated are well within their rights. Some refer to them as the 'control group'? I just hope that they have their lives in order, so their families don't have to worry about making funeral arrangements etc.
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice... I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after.
0	So wait, tell me again why we need a rushed vaccine anyways?
0	My grandmother said vaccines were a joke. She died at 90, drove and lived alone until the day she passed. She had a memory better than mine lol.
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
1	I‚Äôve had four shots myself so I‚Äôm far from an anti vaxxer but this meme isn‚Äôt going to convince anyone who is afraid of long term problems.
0	According to a Washington Post article, the Selz Foundation contributed significantly to the Informed Consent Action Network, which in turn funded campaigns and demonstrations against vaccinations during the 2019 US measles outbreak.
0	I haven't had any vaccine and I am 55. Live and kicking.
0	I'm.26 and I wish I never got the first jab, beacuse my heart is hurting and I cant even go to the gym nomore beacuse my heart hurt.
0	THE VAX IS KILLING HEALTHY PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW IT
0	Don't take the Pfizer experimental gene therapy,  99% of deaths are after the shots.
0	Thank God I never took this poison.
1	STOP COVID TAKE YOUR VACCIN
0	Great question! Why did the UK wait 3 months to disclose data showing COVID vaccine risks outweigh the benefits for the Omicron variant?
1	Science !! I‚Äôm ready for this vaccine.
0	Imagine bragging about getting your 5th shot üòÇ
0	I still wouldn't get covid vaccine. It's too hasty and too soon.
0	Measles vaccine far more dangerous than measles itself
1	I want to receive the vaccination. I trust science, and if the doctors say that it‚Äôs important to immunize, I‚Äôll take their advice.
0	I‚Äôve had no vaccines and completely fine, whats all the shots for exactly? Honest question
1	It is just one story after another of the unvaccinated getting really ill or dying. The microchip theory is crazy. Just carrying your cell phone around all the time allows anyone to track you if they wanted to.
0	Dying because of the vaccine isn‚Äôt covid related, it‚Äôs vaccine related.
0	I found out In the last couple days  my sister in law had a 1 1/2" blood clot in her leg and also my cousin had several strokes and is in hospital in serious condition. As I understand it they were both vaccinated including boosters. Must be a coincidence.
0	SHOUT OUT TO ALL THE PURE BLOODS FIT AND HEALTHY, KEEPING IT REAL ! We can think for ourselves, proper !
0	My mother be mad asf when I send her shit about that Covid vaccination. I hate that both my parents took that shit.
0	Can we stop calling it a vaccine
0	400 deaths after COVID ‚Äúvaccine‚Äùfinally admitted to by the coverup artists at Health Canada. But they deem that number ‚Äúlow‚Äù and count on Canadians being stupid/sheepish enough to believe the lie.
1	One more to go, got my first dose
0	#sad is still raging amongst the #vaccinated please encourage your government to #StoptheShots https://t.co/Cv3yv2a1n7
0	I don't believe that vaccines are necessary for overall health and well-being.
0	Dangerous, deadly, and no thanks!
1	There is no excuse to not vaccinate if no allergies are present.
0	THIS IS SO EVIL AND MISLEADING. The vaccines are responsible for MANY miscarriages just at the flu vaccine was and is. Don't be tricked by these deceivers.
1	The vaccine represents a new dawn in the fight against COVID-19 and a brighter future.
1	Don't be swayed by anti-vaxxer myths, vaccines are safe and effective.
0	"I AM NEVER GETTING VACCINATED!!!!!! EVER!
1	#covid19 still a #pheic, says @WHO Committee, issuing recommendations to help us further overcome the #pandemic across the world. #vaccinenation¬†#vaccines #covid19vaccine #vaccine #who
0	I wouldn't say the vaccine at worst is useless - even if you forced everyone to eat peanut butter someone is going to die, and many have suffered injuries or death due to the vax
0	The bivalent booster was tested on 8 mice.
0	Of course I am now called a conspiracy theorists and a non-scientific-at home facebook fake doctor for not taking the Covid vaccine.
0	No pericarditis and myocarditis was not brought on by a virus.  It was brought on to you by the #COVID19Vaccine aka #TheJab that is not truly a vaccine.    #DirectedEvolution #GainOfFunction #mRNA #PfizerExposed #PfizerLiedPeopleDied #BigPharmaLies #BroughtToYouByPfizer
0	I was close to dying after my second shot of Moderna. Will never take another Covid shot again.
1	To all the people questioning the long term effects of these vaccines, despite the fact that they went through all the proper FDA clinical trials, did you have the same concern for hydroxychloroquine, which only had a few anecdotal cases to show its effectiveness?
0	Its vaccine damage the girl is trying to divert the girl from seeking damages from the oppressors who destroy children's lives best not to listen to media who get paid and discourage people from seeing the drug companies who destroy lives like the nazis of world war 2
1	How are all these anti-vaxxers planning on achieving heard-immunity without widespread vaccination? Praying?
0	I don't think dropping Covid mandates or requirements of any kind is not a "leftist" position. Authoritarianism is not leftist. If he provides supplies and support for people who are affected by Covid negatively, that's the leftist position.
0	Only the vaxxed getting covid again but not the unvaxxed naturally immune
0	Swollen lymph nodes were a result of getting the vaccine for me.
1	I've taken the first dose. Second dose next week. I'm not worried about it because I would rather be protected than not. I am an officer and see people all day.
0	I agree the virus doesn't and doesn't want to kill you. However, the remedy does.
0	What is the meaning of VACCINE ? The clot shot has never been a "vaccine". Chinese have already developed this, and more, variants, and already are using it on their own people. With the cooperation of our government, it's being used on us, as well. We will never know the truth of who invented this, but rest assured, the 1%rs will keep adding to their personal wealth, paid for by us.
0	No this is what happens when no independent evaluations are supervising clinical trials! No more pharmaceutical companies should be allowed to perform or report on clinical trials and research! It must be independent who have no conflict of interest. This must be dealt with severely and swiftly!
0	Denmark has now BANNED giving the vaccine to anyone under 18, because of all the side effects‚Ä¶ Yeah, some "vaccine", eh?
0	You should not. They are not good. They are not vaccines but a new technology based on results from computer models and they are killing more people than the virus.
1	So if so many people in America have health problems, the comorbidity point that anti vaxxers make is dumb.
0	I didn‚Äôt get the vaccine because I don‚Äôt want to be a test subject to some vaccine we don‚Äôt know the long term effects of
1	Yeah, i have no doubts in covid-vaccin
1	Getting vaccinated gives us the power to return to normal life activities.
0	Don't worry folks. New boosters coming this fall. This time the shots will really work - and it's your duty to take another. Remember, we are trying to save grandma.
1	If the vaccines are so bad then, in the event you are bitten by a raccoon, would you decline the rabies vaccine?+B60B15B67:B90
1	fr, Vox explained this so well! it's easily understandable even to a teen like me, so everyone needs to see this. hopefully people will choose to get vaccinated instead of refusing them. coming from a family where my parents, relatives, and even grandparent are doctors, working during this pandemic is exhausting and it can't go on forever. i hope people realise that any step of prevention is important compared to no prevention at all.
1	I think getting vaccinated is actually part of your duty to other people.
1	I got my vaccine last month. get vaccinated!
0	Crazy how much information is suddenly coming out about COVID. ‚Äútrust the science‚Äù is total bs when the science was never done
0	People like this lady are few your a hero for trying to help, so many people are suffering from vacs damage and these money fiends don‚Äôt give a damn!
0	they can't be safe
0	Glad to see someone out there that knows how to use their BRAIN!!!
1	Anti-vaxxers are uneducated cowards. Otherwise they would be more afraid to get the virus than the vaccine. The media on both sides has done a poor job of explaining to the public the risks of long term effects from Covid-disease as compared to probably the safest vaccine that medical science has developed.
0	So everyone can get the same booster that doesn't work, glad you got that all cleared up.
1	Getting your fucking booster and wear your fucking mask. It‚Äôs not difficult, people!
1	I come from a generation that was one removed from polio devastating young and old alike. I knew people who couldn't walk because of polio. So I thought Jonas Salk and vaccines were the best thing that ever happened. I was never even tempted to go down the rabbit hole. My daughter jumped with both feet!
0	If you‚Äôre breathing and have a pulse, DO NOT TAKE THE POISON.
0	Moderna went from a $5B market cap to $160B during Covid. There‚Äôs your answer right there.. So glad to see you covering this topic Kevin. Keep up the excellent work.
0	Safe as in dying suddenly?
1	Anti-vaxxing is a a depopulation tactic
0	They just had to remove a treatment option because it‚Äôs not working with 95% of the new strains nothing has improved it‚Äôs gotten worse
1	Where are the usual, persistent comments supporting the necessity of vaccine mandates, and the dangerous idiocies of ‚Äúanti-vaxxers‚Äù (a term they confuse with anti-mandaters)? You guys not feeling so confident about your screeching at the rest of us anymore?
0	I'm so glad I came across this video too. It really cast a light on this vaccination problem we are facing
1	I never look at comments of these videos, those anti-vaxxers make me real depressed...
0	investigation of whether people 65 and older who have received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent were more likely to have an ischemic stroke in the 21 days following vaccination compared with days 22-44 following vaccination is one question. There are other questions. Has there been an increase in sudden death in 60 yrs or older in the population following release of the vaccine. My empirical evidence is overwhelmingly yes as I have watched multiple healthy people suddenly die over the past 2 years. Muscle damage can be highly variable among individuals and can take more than 21 days to materialize.
1	Getting vaccinated is a step toward a brighter future.
1	As someone who has a lot of fear and anxiety about keeping my loved ones alive I can understand how she got pulled in. The anti-vax movement feeds into the fears that some people already have, and fear driven mind control is very hard to reverse once it's been instilled for any length of time. This woman is showing a lot of strength in admitting she was wrong and she's trying to tell us how this happens so more people don't get pulled in. We should give people a chance to learn and grow, if we constantly condemn people for their past mistakes we're only teaching them that it's not worth trying to learn more or change for the better.
1	Vaccination is the fastest way to return to normal life and defeat this pandemic.
1	That would be perfect. Antimaskers don‚Äôt want that crap.
1	I trust the science behind vaccines and the medical community that supports them.
1	Vaccination against COVID-19 is one of the most effective ways to reduce severe illness and death from infection.
1	you really believe people created a virus and administered it to people with needles? That's called paranoia. It's a phenomenon that you can get help for.
0	stick ya jabs
1	Totally agree with many viewers‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm older, have had all 4 shots, quarantined, masked, everything suggested. We lost many many friends‚Ä¶.who never took the shots‚Ä¶..family members gone‚Ä¶..we got it this past summer‚Ä¶it was bad but we didn‚Äôt have to go to hospital‚Ä¶..was only sick about a week‚Ä¶.we would have died without the shots‚Ä¶.people are insane to not protect themselves and others. It‚Äôs as simple as this‚Ä¶you can drive with no seatbelt‚Ä¶.get in a wreck and die horribly. Or we can drive with a seatbelt and get in a wreck and just have a few bumps, bruises, cuts‚Ä¶but you live‚Ä¶.
1	Just got my first dose today. üí™
1	The vaccine saves lives. Antivaxxers are liars.
0	Why does Donald Trump supports COVID vaccine when he knows the deadly side effects?
1	Encountered this video and I LOVED it ! well done Vox :: new subscriber btw B). this will indeed help people get vaccinated and stop falling for false rumors form media and news. its outrageous
0	I‚Äôm 100% fine with people being hesitant, for vaccination and all, but I‚Äôd like it known heart inflammation is a relatively common severe effect of some common infections.
0	I'm so happy I never got vaxxed and guess what I never got the vid either.
1	This is exactly why this is so exciting... I keep telling everyone I know to go read up on why this new medical tech is so awesome. It's going to change the world and help develop treatments and cures for other fatal diseases.
0	Astra Zeneca in latin it means the star of death...these are your vaccines
0	As an emergency nurse I‚Äôve triaged patients with complications of this vaccine rollout.. I have told my workplace I‚Äôll be resigning if and when it becomes mandatory.. and I don‚Äôt believe in coercion to take vaccines.. we are supposed to allow our patients to have informed consent and respect a patient‚Äôs decision, but we don‚Äôt have that ourselves‚Ä¶.if you want it, have it, but don‚Äôt force those of us who have made the choice it‚Äôs not for us.
0	i got my Pfizer second dose the other week and ive felt more sick than ever, what is this!
0	Because the whole thing was a scam which I saw through from the start. Because it was an experimental jab which doesn‚Äôt meet the definitions of a real vaccine, plus no trials ever done. Plus it‚Äôs killing people. Plus the virus has never been isolated and shown to exist.
0	URGENT ‚Äî French Doctors Throwing Their Stethoscopes Away In Protest Of Failing Healthcare System That COVID-19, Vaccine Mandates, And Lockdowns Made Worse
1	The conspiracy nuts are going to have to convince themselves the government is willing to kill off their military with this deadly vaccine aren‚Äôt they?
1	Prepping us for more life saving injections
0	Im so glad i didn‚Äôt get vaccinated. Since this began in 2020 I haven‚Äôt had COVID once. I work in close contact with the community around me. Trust God and not vaccines.
0	When science stopped trying to test different hypothesis, because they didn‚Äôt follow the narrative, that‚Äôs when I started to question the science (authority). I wasn‚Äôt raised to trust authority to begin with. Power begets power and power corrupts.
1	Vaccines will help protect you by creating antibodies, without having to experiencing sickness
0	Theses leaders all over the world and NHS need to be held accountable for crimes against humanity
1	Important to say that everyone is different, I had a bad headache and fatigue after my vaccination, small price to pay.
0	Even with a gun to my head I wouldn't take the covid vaccine
1	Nonsense. Vaccines reduce the numbers of people who experience serious illness and reduce the death rate. statistically that is absolutely clear.
1	If you are active duty in the United States and are "refusing" to take a Covid vaccine, you should be ashamed of yourself.
1	My mom is currently hospitalized with Covid and pneumonia, with her doctors discussing ventilation. Get your fucking vaccines.
0	Well if you get Covid twice before and after vaccination, then this vaccine is probably useless
0	I‚Äôm not gonna get it.I‚Äôll trust my Immune system
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	Im losing braincells combatting the massive misinformation in facebook, specially those stupid 40year old moms on their phone that they barely know how it works in my country PhilippinesÔ∏è they are literally 2 to 3 decades older than me and they barely use their "life wisdom" and brain, im a stupid who combats stupids..Thanks Doc! more info for me.
0	I didn‚Äôt trust it from the beginning for many reasons
1	My vaccine works for me. It also protects my immunocompromised mother, because while I've had Covid twice, she hasn't caught it from me.
0	I could tell them who is most likely to have a stroke: if they took the Covid pretend 'vaccines', then it's THEM!
1	My mom felt the same way until she was in a coma for two months fighting for her life. First thing she said we she came out of it was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting the shot‚Äù.
1	Vaccines are only most effective when approximately 90% of the population takes them and achieves what is known as herd immunity, which is particularly important.
0	BOTH MY PARENTS NEVVVVVVVVEEEEERRR EVER HAD HEART TROUBLE WITH THEIR HEART ...UNTIL THEY RECEIVED THE COVID-19 VACCINES
0	Hmm, it seems that the vaccine was meant to perpetuate itself, keeping people susceptible to C19,  and therefore making tons of profit for big pharma.270
0	I'm glad I decided to wait to get the jab. Any how I made it through the terrible winter for the unvaccinated, FJB
0	I waited to see how things panned out with the vaccine! I‚Äôll leave it but thanks for the offer.
0	Proudly unvaccinated and 100% immune to adverse vaccine effects.
1	Vaccines have been proven to save lives and prevent the spread of disease. Don't miss the opportunity to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
1	The fact that there are multiple companies making multiple vaccines makes me think this thing will be over and under control sooner than later.
0	I wouldn't trust or believe the CDC if they told me that ice is cold.
1	Run, don‚Äôt walk to get that booster.
1	getting vaccinated is one way I can show my support and gratitude
0	If you have to be persuaded, bullied, pressured, incentivized, lied to, guilt-tripped, coerced, socially-shamed, censored, threatened, paid, punished, and criminalized, if all of this is necessary to gain your compliance, you can be absolutely certain what is being promoted is NOT in your best interest.
0	Is it wise for those with a perfectly healthy immune system to get an experimental shot? A shot from a company with no liability to you should anything go wrong?
1	I've gotten both covid shots, and 3 booster shots, wore an n95 mask, and never spent a day in the hospital. Still healthy as ever, so it looks like those who are against taking precautions that are meant to keep the person's immune system safe, would rather be sorry than safe
1	Lets pull together for next few months, new treatments are on the way soon  If you or someone you know becomes hospitalized w COVID19, eligible patients can participate in clinical trials, at USC & UC-Irvine, while also receiving standard-of-care therapies
1	I intend on getting the vaccine, but I don't wanna be pitted against data that is still unknown
1	I feel bad for the little kids and babies who don't have a vaccine yet. I got mine in March. I stopped wearing my mask mid May. I am back to wearing it again. This is never going away as long as willful ignorance reigns supreme.
0	My sister is going through horrific symptoms after taking the covid vax.
0	hey i don't have any covid vaccine and booster since, but I'm healthy compared to vaccinated.
0	Clot shots, safe and effective heart cloggers.
1	On the other hand, the MOST likely cause of antivaxxers is that antivaxxers like to distort the record, spread conspiracy theories, amd pretend that they‚Äôre being all sciency.
1	I hope they can make a universal COVID vaccine. That would be awesome! If they did that with a flu vaccine, that would be great too!
1	You can tell the Pedatric Intensive Care Unit Doctor is trying so hard to be respectful for the anti-vaxxers, and you can see the sadness in his eyes about their opinions and how it can affect the greater good.
0	Sadly and tragically I have seen many suffer terribly and many die from the so called Covid-19 vaccine.
1	I'm so glad to see the Covid 19 vaccines being released and administered. It's an incredible step forward in our fight against this virus, and I'm so proud of all the hard work that has gone into this.
0	When the stakes are so high and the profit is exorbitant, human life is of no value!
0	Getting vaccinated is the right thing to do. It's our responsibility to protect ourselves and others.
1	They chose 3 brands to ensure the survivability of their citizens in case there is an adverse effect from said vaccines
0	"Empty hospital syndrome" has now morphed into doctors now shilling for big pharma welfare I see.
0	One major truth...those of us who didn't get any of the shots.....don't regret it one bit. We need the truth of what these shots are doing to people to come to full light. Full disclosure.
1	we want novavax!!! WE STILL NEED NOVAVAX APPROVED for 2nd BOOSTER.
1	We can end the pandemic by investing in infrastructure to clean indoor air and developing vaccines that are more effective at reducing COVID spread. In the meantime, masks are one of the most effective tools we have to make society accessible to everyone. Use them!
0	Stop already!!!!!
1	I'm legit allergic to vaccines. So thanks to the rest of yall for keeping us out of the cross fire.
0	It's too late, the mandates and the FDA support, plus the NIH et al. already equal a permanent blank check for pharma - and any retroactive attempt to say otherwise is merely a PR maneuver.
0	The Covid vaccines were designed to keep the Covid emergency going continuously. If people keep getting infected, like the vaxxed ones do, BOOM.. Covid emergency goes through the ‚Äò24 election season. Masks, restrictions, mail in ballots, drop off boxes etc.. etc.. etc..
0	People just need to stop playing their game.
0	I not sure what shots my gf got but she had major strokes after her 3rd shot can't walk or talk anymore she was 58 years old. I'd rather die of covid then to live like she has to now.
1	The biggest side effect I got from being fully vaxxed is not dying from Covid.
0	NEVER!!!!! It didn‚Äôt stop the spread. You didn‚Äôt even test that before you mandated it. It hurt and killed young people, who would of been fine with covid. But the pharmaceutical companies ended up pretty cashed up and without consequence. I‚Äôve never seen this level of government overreach or censorship in my life!
0	NOBODY NEEDED A COVID VACCINE either. Masks were fear 77 propaganda. Pharma profit is the real reason. Sad. Bad.
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	I battled with my decision to get the vaccine, but after praying and really thinking on it, and cause I have an autoimmune deficiency I decided to get it. I was really scared about get the covid virus with my condition and I was also scared about what if I get this vaccine and I get bad side effects. I just diligently prayed about it for a long time.
1	Fuck antivaxxers. Or don't. At least vaccinate the kids in spite of them.
1	I got Sinuvac , not being effective is the BEST scenario
0	A lot of heart attacks in my community, as well as some strokes. All vaccinated, if that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre wanting to call it still. Poisoned would be a better term.
1	Modern has kicked my butt hardcore everytime. I didn‚Äôt notice any difference between the 2nd and Booster. Super swollen and sick. But honestly, the people who have the most severe reactions are people with stronger immune systems. So‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶yay? lol
0	there is clearly a lack of transparency in the vaccine development and approval process, which makes me pick a clear side
1	According to a few articles I have read lately the vaccine is truly safe
1	@bbchealth reports of a  potential #Covid19 vaccine is surely good news for us all. Fingers crossed continuing tests prove successful, at least it gives us hope! #StaySafe
0	I‚Äôm student midwife and doing my placement in the maternity department. I had only 2 vaccines in 2021 because they forced us to do. When I had the vaccines my period stopped for nearly 6 months and I was worried. I thought I‚Äôm going through menopause though I‚Äôm young. Since then i didn‚Äôt have any booster vaccines, it‚Äôs horrifying.
0	Stay away from our children
0	I have a family member that‚Äôs been having seizures from it
0	Any intelligent person realized this long ago. And, as the #vaccines are new, there is not enough history to determine how long the immunity from them will last. #COVID19 antibodies only last 2 months; so you have to get a shot every 2 months, 6, 12? They don‚Äôt know. https://t.co/Q1XMPLdlsQ
1	Children's vaccines should be mandatory, just like safety seats in cars are mandatory.
1	I love the women that was like "I quit smoking a year ago and I'm 41 but the vaccine gave me heart problems" Uhhh.
1	I got the 2-shot Moderna series of vaccination. The first had no perceivable side effects. The second, though, was a beast. About 24 hours subsequent to that shot, I began to feel flu symptoms. It was the kind where even your hair hurts. I crawled into bed Sunday about 4 PM, slept straight through to 4 AM Tuesday. By Thursday I was about 95% better. About 3 months later I got a Moderna booster shot, which did produce some flu-like fatigue but nothing like the ass-kickin' from shot #2. If the experience of that second shot was a mild case of Covid, I doubt very much I would have survived a full-on attack without hospital time.
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
1	Getting vaccinated is our duty to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities. #VaccinesWork
1	My 5g reception has been amazing.
1	Second booster in the books!
1	I think spreading news like this is as bad as the propaganda out there. I wish the pandemic was over but if we are paying close enough attention to statistics of infection rates we know this is not true. Also the new variant looks like I can evade vaccinations and current immunity. Of course the only way to stop variants is to vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate. Please get vaccinated people.
0	For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it
0	Remember when they said you won‚Äôt get covid with the vaccine?
1	I don't wish an Award on anyone: but I'm glad when covidiot healthcare workers no longer spread their tinhattery.
0	Hello and God Bless everyone¬†I want to suggest everyone go to Wikipedia and look up all of the times  the ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù has poisoned people against their will-or in secret in the name of ‚Äúscience‚Äù. An example is this one-go ahead and type it in. ‚ÄúPresident apology for Tuskegee‚Äù
1	Tell your friends and family to vaccinate ASAP. Ain‚Äôt no vitamins or kangen water going to save us from measles
0	Insurance Analyst demonstrates the link between #COVID19 #vaccines and increased mortality using proven statistical methods and government data. Insurance companies are the ONLY ones with an interest in this. Except us. #vaccinegenocide
0	I cannot trust a vaccine produced this quick. So many steps skipped.
0	Look Basically I'm just not gonna take it (the vaccine) I'm sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I know..... UGH I know..... It's just that I'm not taking it is all!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
0	When the truth comes out, you can‚Äôt unvaccinate yourself.
0	I don‚Äôt even upgrade my iOS for many months after the new one is released, as it invariably proves incompatible with one or more of the apps I‚Äôm running before all the bugs are worked out, but they expect us all to inject this insufficiently tested substance into our very bodies without hesitation.
0	I got the jab‚Ä¶worst decision of my life. Ever since I got it I have had health problems such as a chronic cough, chest pains and regurgitation. Anyone else feel similar?
0	Seem I can‚Äôt watch television any more without being bombarded with commercials telling me that if I or a family member used any number of drugs on the market and we‚Äôre adversely affected or suffered death that I should call any number of law firms. These are drugs that went through the years long process of gaining FDA approval, yet millions of Americans allowed the government to inject, into their bodies something that was studied for less than a year, and not once, but several times, and still continuing even in the face of evidence proving it does not work. Waiting to see those commercials
0	Critical thinking always promoted not taking the vaccine. It takes at least 10-12 years to vet a vaccine and to get a vaccine that actually works.
1	I even got the Omicron booster and my balls are still normal size
0	Vaccines are not working.
0	This healthy 63-year old has had his last jab.
0	Remember when all these liberals told me that I am selfish for not getting the COVID vaccine? The same people are now dropping dead, live with life long side effects and came to know that the vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent COVID! Good times!
1	This video somehow helps me change my mind. I honestly was scared and doubtfull about the vaccine but now I'm feeling pretty much secure about taking it‚Ä¶
1	I wonder how many of them know that the vaccine isn't even injected into your bloodstream?
0	you were trained to be obedient and afraid ...worked well ...lots more coming ...maybe listen to the plans the WEF has for us
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab‚Ä¶NOT ONE.
1	I've been vaccinated since I could get it. No regrets. No COVID-19 either. Don't spread lies for likes.
0	This is propaganda!! They must show proves of what they contain and that those components are safe for humans .
0	I will NEVER ever get the vaccine. Period.
1	Yay! My husband is currently in line at work waiting to receive his. I‚Äôm so happy for him. happy tears!
1	I am very happy!
0	Just tell them you're medically exempt dude, it's illegal for them to ask you to prove your medical details. Just walk right in
1	Yes, I will get vaccinated! I can finally see the light at the end of this long tunnel and for once it isn‚Äôt an oncoming train.
1	‚ÄúUnexpected‚Äù deaths? What is that? Sounds awfully broad and not related to COVID vaccine of which MILLIONS OF PEOPLE have had 4-5 doses. COVID took over our lives TWO almost 3 YEARS ago. Give it up! The vaccine is safe and saves lives!
1	I always struggle to understand how a religious exemption to vaccination is supposed to be valid. Vaccination is only a couple of hundred years old, and yet a religion which started thousands of years ago is supposed to have not only predicted vaccination, but pre-emptively banned it. And Jesus spoketh "and do not partake of the immunology needle and speak not of the immunologist and virologist"...
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
0	So fucking pain, a lot of side effects emerged, causing the headaches and fever last weeks.I do not want to try again!!!
0	it‚Äôs funny‚Ä¶ so many people I know who got the vax always get sick. I‚Äôm unvaxed and never get sick.
0	Proud of this young lady for saying NO. I know so many people who had injections and are ill now. I have a 23 year old female friend who had to go on BLOOD THINNERS just days after her first AZ shot (she worked with the elderly at the time). She had to get a second to keep her job, despite her injuries. I thank GOD every single day that I donot watch TV, listen to propaganda or this utter nonsense.
0	I don't trust what the government or the pharmaceutical companies are telling us how safe the untested vaccine is. The long team effects of the vaccine are unknown and won't be for several years.
0	Never trust someone who hasn't taken the shot.
0	I also have an adult daughter with autism; my 2018 book, Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel‚Äôs Autism, became a dog whistle for anti-vaccine activists.
1	You should really get vaccinated
1	It‚Äôs a great vaccine, it‚Äôs a safe vaccine, and it‚Äôs something that works.
1	I finally got Covid after 3 years. I can tell you that my quadruple vaccinations, along w/yearly flu vaccinations saved me from the hell that my husband is going through. He opted out this year, thought the vaccines messed w/him before & now he‚Äôs MISERABLE.
0	I do not take the chance of doing the vaccine even if I lose my job.
0	So glad my family avoided this experimental shot with zero long term effect studies.
0	Smart people won't be getting any doses or boosters, so who cares how much they'll cost? They'll cost $0 if you don't get one. I just hope that my state will get smarter, so I don't have to wear a mask to go into most healthcare facilities (although I don't need one to see the eye doctor, nor my husband's ENT, so I think it's left to the discretion of the clinic, rather than any state mandate).
0	WHO is lier and murderer of human on earth. Down with WHO!
0	My wife and I were guilted by multiple ‚Äúfriends‚Äù when we didn‚Äôt take the experimental jab. I now refuse to allow a single one of them in my home. I have no room for forgiveness when it comes to wanting me to risk my family‚Äôs health.
0	To say the COVID vaccine and boosters are not safe and effective is a gross understatement.
1	The #CovidVaccine gives us the power to protect the most vulnerable among us. Let's stand together in solidarity
0	‚ÄúIf you want to see if side effects show up in two years, well that takes two years‚Äù = the worlds most powerful doctor.
1	If you‚Äôre antivax and you see me making fun of antivax people, I just want to say that I am talking about you personally and I hope you‚Äôre offended because you‚Äôre fucking stupid.
1	Its good to get the vaccine
1	I Just came to see if there are some antivaxers. I am glad that i'm vaccinated
1	I think they just want to stay home on lockdown and let the virus burn the world down and watch conspiracy theory videos all day
1	the vaccine will protect you from hospitalization and death should you contract the virus
0	You're overloaded with spike protein. Natural covid infection produces spike protein. All the vaccines and boosters you've had also make your body produce spike protein. Spike protein is toxic. Stop getting vaccinated.
1	there are many underlying genetic conditions which make people more susceptible to Covid. Many of these are unknown. These may decide your fate. You thinking you are healthy may have nothing to do with you getting severely ill or dying from covid. So. For your sake, your family‚Äôs and others around you. Get your shot.
0	When is this sham going to end?
0	New data shows that 100% of COVID deaths in Canada are caused by mRNA vaccines...How will the media hide this again?
1	Crazy how the generation that told us "Don't believe everything you see online" while we grew up turned out to be the one most convinced of batshit conspiracy theories
0	What's going to happen when Americans figure out that their friends and family and children are dying suddenly because of dangerous vaccines mandated by their government? Which were supposed to protect them from a virus created by their government? We will find out in 2023.
0	More #hospital #nurses blow whistle on ‚Äú #overwhelming ‚Äù number of #heartattacks, #bloodclots occurring in the fully #vaccinated  https://t.co/hnnzCXhtoJ https://t.co/CctiehUxeX
0	Unbelievable. Hope this dude can turn this around, would be incredible to see him make a full recovery. #FuckModerna
1	I hate vaccines. I hate needles. I hate pretty much anything to do with foreign things in my body. But do I get the vaccines anyways? Do I still go to the doctor? Yes, because I don‚Äôt want to fucking die or get sick and cause other people to be sick. This idiot trying to prevent their own child(well, adult son) from getting the vaccine‚Ä¶whatever happened to the right to choose they go on about so much?
0	My doctor informed me that for MY CASE, MY risk from the shot is higher than MY risk from the virus. I suggest you consult YOUR DOCTOR before making such a choice.
0	This vaccine is part of their agenda. Nobody wants a microchip.
0	Had a normal 13 boy in family die a year ago after vaccine. He felt bad, threw up, went to bed and died. Autopsy has been "inconclusive" WA state. Grief is overwhelming and infuriating at times.
0	I know one person who died of heart attack at 38, and another one who got a blood clot in brain, both were healthy prior to vaccine.
0	I haven‚Äôt had it and seen no covid at all and I‚Äôm feel great
1	Not the 125% as the antivaxxers claimed ? Strange.
0	So 98% doesn't get sick from covid. You take the vaccin and get 38.5 degrees fever. Not taking the vaccin. My wife had astrazenica yesterday and only had headache and was somewhat more tired. Little bit of nausea too.
1	The vaccine was extraordinary effective at preventing/reducing transmission of alpha/delta strains. There is plenty of data to support this. Omicron changed this equation. Whether vaccine mandates were justified can be argued on many other points.
1	Get your antivax garbage off my page
1	I think the benefits of a covid vaccine were worth the cost/benefit.
0	I was taught to say "NO TO DRUGS " moma taught me well...
0	How many people lost their lives TO the vaccine?
0	NEARLY 3 YEARS ON AND I‚ÄôM NOT ‚ÄúVAXXED‚Äù NEVER SICK EVER!
1	I understand that I'm not a mother yet, but I still don't get why some people are choosing not to vaccinate their children #provaccination
0	Because I AM FORCED TO GET IT. I got COVID twice I didn‚Äôt feel crap, I am healthy and strong. I know so many people that got it and got problems. They still got sick, even worse than me and they had there vaccine. I can‚Äôt even leave my country, I am stuck inside canada It shouldn‚Äôt be obligatory you have your own choice some people are healthy and trust there body to fight it by itself. It‚Äôs your choice, your body
1	The vaccine saves lives, PLEASE go get it!
1	I understand your concerns. It's important to make an informed decision, but I would encourage you to look at the evidence and consider the benefits of vaccination. The more people who get vaccinated, the sooner we can return to some sense of normalcy and protect the most vulnerable in our societ
1	yes ofcoarse you can still get the virus even if youre vaccinated, same way you can still get pregnant even if you use birth control, and still die from a car crash even if you wear a seatbelt. but does that mean youre not going to wear a seatbelt anymore or not take birth control anymore? the vaccine is not a cure, its a layer of protection up to 95%. the vaccine protects you from developing severe symptoms from the virus, so you dont die. it also reduce the risk of you spreading the virus, so other people dont die.
0	That's the point: It doesn't work.
1	The irony of giving tocilizumab to unvaccinated patients who wouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated because it hasn‚Äôt been studied long enough is something I can‚Äôt get over
0	Natural immunity is 99.9% effective.
0	As a healthcare worker these adverse reactions are more common than you think. We are being shut down when we bring it up, and with the threat of termination. I have seen so many bleeding issues (strokes, gi bleed, rectal bleeds, tumors) than ever before. üò¢
0	Covid is never going to go away
1	Turn yours' children under vaccination programme.
1	Vax is key to controlling the spread of the coronavirus and ending the pandemic.
0	Covid vaccine is killing people
0	why should I risk and get the jab and its side effects? I take care of myself.
0	people who have received the shots are the "most vulnerable" because the effectiveness of "the second vaccine has faded." Bennett admitted these shots are not preventing the Delta variant.
1	Did you all forget about the outbreak of chicken pox in brooklyn because the kids were not vaccinated? I don‚Äôt agree with any non vaccers when it comes to all the standard childhood vaccines.
1	10. "I'm hesitant to get the vaccine because of the limited information available."
1	The vaccine has shown a high level of effectiveness in preventing COVID-19.
0	I was vaccinated long ago by the blood of the lamb (JESUS) I will never be vaccinated by any other means!
1	Informative and easy to understand The goal of the vaccines is to prevent you from the death (effectiveness) while minimising you to go to hospital (efficacy)
0	He's the wet dream customer of vaccine manufacturers.  Gets injured and still encourages others to do the same. Good luck with your quarterly boosters, buddy.
0	Why are we still going down the Oxford  vaccine route  It's almost completely ineffective
0	No vaccine for me or my husband!!  No thank you!!
1	If you're young and healthy, maybe you don't have to worry about Covid being a death sentence. But what percentage of Americans could be described this way? I'd say the majority are overweight. So, perhaps every American doesn't need to get the vaccine, but the majority should.
0	Imagine a product so awful that you have to lobby for tyrannical laws just so ppl will buy it
1	I know this goes against doctors‚Äô hippocratic oath, but what we need is for doctors to refuse to treat and accept patients who refuse vaccinations. The end.
1	Got 3 covid vaccines. 9 months later, i got covid. Lost my sense of smell and taste.   Didnt gave a shit about it, though. So I continued smoking and just ate a lot of fruits while smoking and drank juice while smoking.
0	too many lives have been lost to COVID-19 vaccinatio
0	Natural immunity is what has kept us alive our entire lives from billions of illnesses that we never had to get sick from. Because our immune systems were that efficient. Intervention with manmade harmful poisons was a very bad idea. They know that.
1	Absolutely zero side effects from the 4 Pfizer shots. But that two shit shingles vaccine? Now ùô©ùôùùôñùô© was terrible!
0	Props to Sacks for being able to admit he was wrong about taking the vaccine. Jason loves to backtrack.
0	Stomach pain was another side effect I experienced after getting the vaccine.
0	My father got vaccinated on 15th March, 2021 and some days later he started having hiccups and it lasted like 9 days then he died. He was a strong man with no serious health issue.  god help humanity
1	Having a kid with asthma is scary sometimes. COVID19 made it much scarier. This girl HATES shots, but she was super brave. She was unhappy with her bandaid though. I feel so blessed today.
0	Novac dojovic proved once again that vaccination was totally false. It's only for business.
1	Louisiana, homeland of the brainwashed people, hence the latest covid 19 and delta surge. As of today 542k cases with 11k deaths. And people still refuse to vaccinate. So maddening and frustrating.
0	I'm not convinced in what this man is saying and I'm still not getting vaccinated
1	Vaccines are our best weapon against COVID-19 and will help us return to normal life.
0	How can anyone trust a vaccine without any long-term trials?
1	I get the first of the Moderna vaccines tomorrow. I've never been excited to get a shot before, but I certainly am now!
0	This guy has selective cognition..he conveniently ignores tons of negative information about the vaccine and manages to give it a healthy color..!!
0	Death jab...
1	I got my third shot this week. The protection is worth it
0	UK Govt admits COVID-19 Vaccine Mortality Data Flawed. Claims of Vax efficacy retracted.  Why is this NOT being covered by the BBC?   Answer: they are corrupt.   PLEASE RETWEET!!!
1	Because so far, nearly 100 million doses of vaccine have been given and there has been only one death which might, possibly, have been due to a bad reaction to the vaccine. One in 100 million is a lot less than the risk of dying from, say, eating a toffee.
0	Still unvaccinated, and couldn‚Äôt be happier.
1	New York! Thousands of COVID-19 Vaccine appoints available:
0	The more information comes out the more I‚Äôm proud I stayed strong and did not take the shots, (I‚Äôm 27) Turns out it was one of the best decisions in my life. I‚Äôm thankful that many of my friends and family took that same decision and it definitely payed off.
1	Its a shame that so many people wont take it
0	No vax!
0	Watch what it does to your menstrual cycle
1	it is a vaccine in the sense of the flu vaccine. Reduces your risk of a severe outcome but doesn't protect 100%. Also needs to be adjusted and updated and retaken regularly, just like the annual flu vaccine.
0	Imagine believing any of this bs propaganda
1	Choosing not to vaccinate puts not just yourself, but also others at risk.
0	I have no problem with tested vaccines. I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm not just gonna take your word for it, government-who-has-a-history-of-lying-to-it‚Äôs-citizens.
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab‚Ä¶NOT ONE.
0	Poison and crimes on Humanity!
0	I looked closely at the risk benefit when two of my friends died within weeks of the jab, summer ‚Äò21. I paid a huge price for this investigation into the risks. I lost my job and was 10 months without work, ran thru my savings and had to move 1000 miles from family for work. Even thru all the heartbreak of leaving the home of my birth, family and friends, being close to financial ruin, and emotional distress, I still feel like I did the right thing for myself with taking this stand against unjust mandates.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	I got my vaccines as soon as they were available. I have had 3 and feel fine. I really hope others will protect themselves and their families and friends from this disease.
1	Greta herself has been clear that it is unfair to put the full burden of hope and change on one individual, let alone the youth.
0	When i was younger and brought it up, my mom would tell me she had saved me from getting autism, because apparently after one shot I started showing symptoms of autism, so she decided to not give me any more vaccines.
0	Bravo to everyone who resisted all the threats, bullying and intimidation by the mainstream media, govs and elites to get the jab.
1	so true ! I get so angry that people who refuse to get vaccinated are just prolonging the pandemic and will end up making it worse because the thing will mutate to something we don't have a vaccine for! It is really hard for me to understand this!
1	Since my first jab i can now clean my eyes with my tongue!!! ü¶éü¶éü¶é
0	I just want to say that you cannot always judge people by their age. Some people in their 20s are horribly sick while some people in their 50s + 60s may be incredibly healthy. Not everyone in a particular age group has the same risk just because you are in a certain age group! It needs to be based on the individual as well. Like I am 51, I am metabolically healthy, no jab, i have not had that C19 at all and I can walk a half marathon (and often do). So I am physically fit, lean muscle mass, and I am super careful what I eat. I do not eat SAD. I do keto. Almost carnivore. Basically I avoid foods I react to + create inflammation. But I have the willpower to do that. Many don't.
0	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus‚Ä¶
1	He or she can't, anti-vaxxers are unable to produce more than a few lines of totally useless lies or unproven nonsense.
0	If anyone takes the va??? when they know it‚Äôs experimental and know the manufactures have legal immunity so you can‚Äôt sue them if you get sick or die from it, then you are really dumb.
1	It took us a good 2 years to make a vaccine and now the cases are slowing down. I hope everyone is doing just great in the pandemic.
1	This paper investigates the group identities of people with positive and negative attitudes towards vaccination, and their attitudes toward general science.
0	Im proud to be unvaccinated
0	Nothing tastes even close to good after taking my two shots of the vaccine. Everything I used to love to eat now disgusts me.
0	the government should just make the case for the vaccine and then shut up and let people decide for themselves... back off now you creeps!
0	Hell no. At least not until all the side effects are worked out. I'll let all these other sheep be the Guinea pigs. Even after that, probably hell no.
0	They are setting up covid vaccine desks on the streets in town enticing people to take the shot. I saw one today. Straight to the innocent people who have no information about those vaccines and they are taking it. We are cruising nicely!!
1	you better go get one !
1	I wonder if Johnson & Johnson will be available in the supermarket.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	I believe that vaccines can overload the immune system.
1	Sorry, none of your silliness is addressing any of the evidence that COVID-19 vaccines work.
0	YOU'RE LYING
0	My brother in law was a perfectly healthy individual with no history of mental illness. He had two Pfizer jabs. Two days ago he was submitted to a mental institution for extreme paranoia. He recently retired as an insurance claims investigator and was always a productive happy individual. Just sayin
0	So Bill Gates is funding the fake eggs industry just like he‚Äôs funding the COVID vaccine industry.
1	Yup, it absolutely should be safe to take
1	I got a shot two times with Biontech/Pfizer, but my husband got one shot of Johnon & Johnson and I was worried about if this was enough to keep him healthy. Now I'm much more confident after I saw the results of the vaccines.
1	My only side effect is that I'm allergic to those who spread and allow vaccine misinformation to be spread on public platforms endangering the lives of others .
1	This is gaslighting. Trying to tell her that her friend‚Äôs injury was random and there was no causal relationship to the kool-aide, gaslighting.
1	I am a biologist. I understand epidemiology and pandemics. I wasn't afraid of the vaccination. I understand how they are made and how they work. I was afraid of the virus. I didn't want to put others in my family and community at risk. And I knew for the world to move past the pandemic I needed to be a part of a vaccinated populace.
0	Silenced Professor Christopher Exley WARNED NHS re vaccine harms. 30year untainted research revealed heart & brain damage following jabs, collapse/death, eye overt-sperm damage, BABY DEATHS, autism ADHD cancer MS MND+ Why ignore professor warning us of vaccine harms?
1	Can we stop acting like social distancing is no big deal? I agree masks and vaccines aren't a big deal. But social distancing causes isolation which can lead to depression, suicidal thoughts, uptick in substance abuse. Makes people sacrifice seeing their loved ones. Social distancing has devastating impact on businesses and jobs (such as concerts, event jobs etc) I hate when people minimize the devastating impacts of social distancing and act like people are being babies for not wanting to do it.  Vaccinated people should never be forced to experience that again
0	The vaccine also makes gay people straight!
1	I've had COVID twice. The first vaccine shot was worse. The second, not so bad.   But yeah, the first shot was the only of the 4 experiences that knocked me down, was a rough few days.
1	Coronavirus vaccines have been authorized by the FDA and other worldwide health organizations, trust in the process
0	This right is never different from what the feminists are trying to advocate: Our body, our choice.
1	Been there, done that. Got my 2nd Pfizer/Bio-Ntech shot a couple of weeks ago. Gave me a mild case of the sniffles for about 36 hours, which subsided afterwards. Now, I can freely go into restaurants, the movies, cafes.
0	I decline.
1	I will take it.All 3 of the current major contenders for Covid-19 vaccination have been extensively tested on 10s of thousands of volunteers with a fatality rate of zero and very minor side effects, if any.
1	To be fair the vaccine is only possible because of decades of R&D. Once this hit they simply had to map its genome and put a section into their previously developed technology. The pandemic was just a great reason to put it into widespread use.
0	I had problems for several months after my first and second jabs, which I was reluctant to have. These included headaches lasting for several months afterwards and what looked like rainbow coloured blurred vision. I couldn't focus my eyes and as this happened in public one time, was quiet terrifying. I'm glad I wasn't driving at the time.
0	I was very pro vaccine, & believed healthcare was noble until I saw through the covid bs. I worked as a CPhT for over ten years. The plandemic opened my eyes and I quit my career 10/2021. How on earth anyone wanted a shot that was slapped together at Warp Speed is beyond me.
0	My wife and I were guilted by multiple ‚Äúfriends‚Äù when we didn‚Äôt take the experimental jab. I now refuse to allow a single one of them in my home. I have no room for forgiveness when it comes to wanting me to risk my family‚Äôs health.
0	Fauci is Science!
1	I am schedule for my vaccine next week.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
0	Probably 80% of the people I‚Äôve diagnosed recently are vaccinated and boosted. It seems to have no effect, from my personal experience.
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
1	I‚Äôve been getting irritated. Thank you for this video. Sincerely, thanks for the break down of the issues and keeping me faithful in science.
0	A vaccine for a virus that has a death rate of 1%? I‚Äôll take my chances.
0	This is the only vaccine that people take three times, then wear masks, close businesses, stay home, and still get the disease, only to turn around and blame the unvaccinated for their trouble
1	imagine being an anti-vaxxer in 2021
0	I refused a heart operation to seal a 13mm hole because they wouldn‚Äôt guarantee, if I needed blood it would be unvaccinated
0	The only people getting covid are those vaccinated against it
0	You dont protect older people by taking things you dont need. I am 50. I dont REMOTELY NEED A FLU VACCINE **** OFF.

0	such a lack reasoning behind his decision to get a medicine he knows nothing about...
1	So tired of people talking about Conspiracy theories it‚Äôs not a conspiracy it‚Äôs truth
0	I remember a time when they called us conspiracy theorists
1	It‚Äôs a privilege to have vaccines and it sucks to see people ignore it
1	I hope all who want to get vaccinated get it soon. Do you?
0	This paper sent shivers down my spine. 75% of the world population took these shots according to this paper. So I‚Äôm guessing this was to reduce the world population. These shots can‚Äôt be just bad science, they had to know.
0	Never did. Never will. #CCPVirus #CovidVaccine
0	don‚Äôt see a point since people in my age range don‚Äôt have any major issues.
1	Had all my required vaccinations as a kid. 18 more additional vaccinations during my 21 year Army career. 2 doses of Covid-19 and 1 booster. I also turn 65 this October with nary a health problem
1	While I think anti-vaxxers are idiots, I can at least understand it. Those same anti-vaxxers were the ones who were breaking containment strategies and creating superspreader situations though, while demanding the government do nothing, which allowed it to get this out of control.
0	Creating a new virus variant to sell vaccines is extremely Unethical, should never be allowed
0	The first example I saw of this was the tragic tale of nurse Jennifer Lee McClung, who died from COVID-19 anti-vaccination complications at the age of 54.
1	32. "I won't be getting the vaccine because I don't think it's necessary."
1	I understand that we are taught to not trust medical institutions, but the way the vaccine works (if you understand it) makes you feel more safe.
0	I can't comply with that... It's going to get very dystopian up in here real fast with mandates like these
0	I‚Äôll translate Bill Gates part: I told tech companies to ban people who spoke out against the clot shot.
0	#Vaccinated people developed AIDS in Germany. A huge number of them.
0	I‚Äôm still waiting to die from Covid lol. Joe Biden said I would die if I didn‚Äôt get vaccinated.
0	No thanks not for me
0	And you believe 6 million people died from covid, and still think the vaccine is effective.
0	According to the NIH, brain fog, headaches, blood pressure swings are potential long term side effects of the Covid vaccine. Their claim is this is rare but the numbers aren‚Äôt easy to find. So what they mean by ‚Äúrare‚Äù isn‚Äôt clear.
0	My aunt took the shot last week and now is in the hospital, don't believe the lies!
0	I don't always trust my doctor's opinion. so No!
0	I‚Äôm still NOT getting vaccinated.
0	Imagine being Vaccinated and having to worry every single night that you might not wake up the next day.
0	I live by one rule. I don't buy anything that needs propaganda. Soooo, its a no from me.
1	I‚Äôve been vaccinated and have had all the boosters provided for my age group in Saskatchewan. 6 times now I‚Äôve been to a clinic or Pharmacy for them. I have friends and relatives who are immune comprised so I go faithfully to insure their health as well as my own. I‚Äôm perfectly healthy at age 65. I‚Äôve still never got Covid. If I could share a photo for proof for all the non-believers I would. But it doesn‚Äôt really matter what those people think because I have a clear conscience that I won‚Äôt make others sick from my fears.
0	Moderna just had to recall over a million doses sent to japan as they discovered metal particulates in it. Several people died within days of taking it but they are saying the deaths are ‚Äúcoincidental‚Äù and not related to the metal.
1	Had my first dose and looking forward to my second.
1	I'm getting my second covid shot tomorrow
1	Vaccines have saved countless lives and eradicated diseases that were once a major threat. It's important that we all  do our part and get vaccinated.
1	I‚Äôm fully vaxxed and I‚Äôve had Covid twice now (currently suffering through the 2nd) I‚Äôve been quarantined since 2 days before I got tested cause I was starting to feel gross. It‚Äôs definitely not going anywhere anytime soon, but the vaxx really does help with the symptoms. My mom has it too and isn‚Äôt vaxxed and she‚Äôs having a really rough time.
1	I‚Äôm praying that the vaccine will work and praying for a better
1	Be vaccinated , our immune system cells then recognise the spike protein as a threat and begin building an immune response against it.
0	The fact that they‚Äôre trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
0	No one should force another person to inject something into their bodies against their will
0	There have never been any long-term tests completed on any of these vaccines. We will all find out together in the next 3-20 years.
1	The chance of dying for me when infected is about 1%. The chance of dying shortly after vaccination is 0.000,01 %. Not difficult to make a choice.
1	I have done better. I have already had the vaccine - possibly - before it has been proved safe.
0	Strong unvaxxed. Always good in my bed.
0	How about NOT getting vaxxed and living normally. That way you don‚Äôt have a chance of seizures, blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks or Bell‚Äôs Palsy
0	Right here where I live!! This guy was Bragging?? Wtf!! 4th one does it they say!! Stupid fucking shots! When are they going to be done with?? This has to end!!
0	Why are a growing number of doctors opposing the administration of COVID-19 vaccines? Because we were told a lie.
1	This bridge is 99.7% safe to cross. Anti vaxxer: I'll swim instead
0	Vitamin D is most important in combatting covid. Why do you never advise supplementing diet with it and instead urge people to be injected with a treatment that literally has the worst safety profile of any 'vaccine' ever including some that were withdrawn for safety reasons.
0	She got the placebo and her father got the real stuff. It's amazing how there are still many rushing out to get this crap into their bodies. Keep gambling with your life, you might not get the placebo.
0	Back in 2021, I did a pretty basic risk assessment based on clearly available data regarding the risk of severe infection for ME as an individual being 38 and in good health. I declined the shots. All further attempts to gaslight, manipulate, and coerce me that did not address my initial observations only had the affect of galvanizing my initial assessment.
1	Don't be a player in the game of misinformation and fear. Be a player in the game of saving lives by getting vaccinated. #VaccineNation #COVID19Vaccine

0	Dear CNN ‚Äújournalists:‚Äù do you not yet see that the tide is turning? Do you not yet see that people are done with your lies? Do you not see the examples of honest journalists (project Veritas is one great example) are making their living actually doing journalism instead of shilling for pharma?  There is work out there for you that involves your chosen profession PLUS the ability to sleep soundly at night. Have courage!
1	I'm happy to report that I am fully vaxxed!
1	Germany fines the unvaccinated.  Just an idea.  Edit: turns out I was wrong, Germany rejected calls to impose fines on people who didn't show up for their scheduled shots. It was Indonesia who was threatening sanctions and fines on people refusing to vaccinate to boost compliance.  But you gotta admit, it's a damn good idea.
0	I'm SO glad I'm not the only one who still trusts his gut feeling and discernment about things! Just because the government and some doctors, in whom many of us trust, press people to follow through with something, it does NOT mean there's justification behind it. I did not allow nor encourage my family to get the poison. I sincerely hope that those who fell victim to this negligence find some sort of peace and healing
1	Wish I could take the vaccine
0	I get to choose what I put in MY body
0	Breaking free from my former limited thinking, I now stand with the people who are open-minded and proudly say I'm 100% anti-vax.
1	Dont like wearing a mask and things being at limited capacity? Once enough of us are vaccinated, that will happen. Get your shots, morons.
0	The AstraZeneca sign on the bottle says recombinant it means DNA they are letting the public know they are messing about with people's DNA
1	The only remaining question is when can I get a dose?  When can I assume the people I walk past in the street have had a dose?
0	Making claims.. is a polite way of saying they lie‚Ä¶ they lie!

0	Im dying if i take this!!
1	90% of COVID and variant cases are with the unvaccinated. Epidemic of the unvaccinated.
0	@TheRealDoctorM2 Ok but then why are you promoting this vaccine elsewhere in your tweets? A confident Phase IV is at minimum  10 years. RNA can enter into other metabolic pathways than the one involved in your ribosomes.  #vaccine #SARSCoV2 #COVID19
1	Vaccines literally saves lives. These anti vaccine conspiracy theorys are getting out of hand!
0	These doctors are speaking up on how healthcare professionals were bullied and intimated into staying silent about the clot shots.
0	Short answer to this is ‚ÄúTake NO more vaccines‚Äù!!!!
0	WHY‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.That‚Äôs my question, WHY are they trying to get mRNA into every living being on the planet????
0	The office of the national broadcaster of the Netherlands NOS pasted over with stickers with the names of people who died from coronavirus vaccines.
0	I remain unvaxxed and covid free. Prayers for family and friends who've endured horrible side affects.
1	"What we can learn from the victory over A good refresher on how polio came to an end. Let's not forget "
0	This article is "Bipolar" to say the least. It starts by saying that there is a chance that Pfizer vax could be the cause of stroke, and ends by saying, no it is not. Well, FYI , the public understands: Your vaccine is causing loads of deaths by blood clot. We know it. We observed it. However, you do not want to break the news so the population does not go insane. If they were not lying, as usual, more than 80% of the US population is double or triple vaxxed. Scary . Scary , scary.
1	Look at the data. There are significantly less hospitalizations and deaths from covid now thanks to these vaccines. It‚Äôs simple to look it up.
0	The facts that all the scientists who tried to warned about the serious side effects was ridiculed, labeled as conspiracy theorists, bullied, killed, and removed from all major platforms. The leaders who were in power during this time and allowed this all need to held accountable to to maximum extent.
1	Just got my vaccine today. Only side effect I feel is like someone punched my arm ten times. It‚Äôs sore lol
0	Good for all of them. The real heroes of the Scamdemic
0	I don‚Äôt trust the government or the drug companies enough to feel that my personal well being is something close to their heart. The government has to do something, even if it is wrong and the drug companies are getting rich. When I think of a synthetic substance being injected into my body with no idea how it will affect me in a year, 5 years, 10 years‚Ä¶. Eeks! The virus can mutate (change to a new one) every 10 hours. So the vaccine that's made today doesn't work tomorrow and we can never catch up. There is talk of booster shots every year because of that. The vaccine bypasses the bodies natural immune response and leaves the body vulnerable to not only new Covid strains....but any other viruses as well. Science has no clue whether the virus is going to go up or down or stabilize. They are completely at a loss and that is scary.
0	if it was so effective as you show , you would not need a third or fourth dose in a range of few months!!!
0	I have non vacced o negitive blood I will give for children needing it

0	I've always had little hope in the UN and the WHO, but covid has only reinforced my thoughts.

0	Your vaccines are death jabs.
0	The vaccine does not work! Why do you continue to take boosters. The vaccinated are getting covid and passing it on. What about the sudden deaths! Serious vaccine injuries!
1	The day it was approved I wept so heavily. My daughter wasn't quite 2 when COVID started. It's been a hard journey. I got my daughter the first available appointment for a vaccine I could. She's now two shots in on Pfizer and come September we will finally be at fully vaccinated.
1	Get vaccinated for yourself and everyone else around you. Don't be the one responsible for someone else's death.
0	I trust my immune system
0	Previous vaccines with much more testing, and much lower incident rates were pulled from market. Original swine flu vaccine comes to mind.
0	My cousin Sniper, 26, a professional hitman, was mandated to take Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, 3 days later paralyzed from legs down, followed by severe convulsions and seizures, can no longer clean, cook, drive a car, I'm a prisoner in my own home
1	Got vaccinated today, i felt so safe and relieved
1	I'm so grateful that they've learned so much about how the virus and the vaccines work. We are also blessed to have vaccines
1	Vaccination has saved me from a new infection, the covid vaccine is the greatest invention in the world!
0	It takes years for side effects to appear, and they could very well be worse than the sickness
0	If the vaccine was that great, why need boosters!
0	No I did not nor do I want the vaccine or boosters. At the beginning I said we don‚Äôt know enough about the vaccine, risks, adverse reactions. I‚Äôm still saying that. Masks are ineffective, too.
0	It's a terrible time for being able to live how you want. My job has been affected massively by my stance on not having the jab. It's really not fair we are treated like conspiracy theorists just for having questions
0	Getting any vaccination at any time may increase your risk of future health issues !
0	natural immunity baby !!! Maskless vaxxless outside every day workout and eat right for the win !!!
1	I'm 74 and many people I grew up with have died, but no one I talk with have had a problem with the vaccine. I caught covid really bad before the vac was ready and lucky to be here.
1	If they could be convinced with actual facts and not just anecdotal evidence from dubious sources that confirm what they want to believe, then they wouldn‚Äôt be anti vaxxers.
1	As a healthcare worker I am always amazed how the majority of the population can't do college level science  but are suddenly virology majors. I wish they had medical training and could comprehend the stupidity of their "expertise".
0	I cannot trust the Biden administration, I do not believe anything they say about COVID and the vaccine
0	I just had Covid for the first time. 46 year old male, minor sore throat, some sniffles and body aches and a bad headache(I often get headaches tho) for a few days. I am not vaccinated and have no plans to get vaccinated.
0	I cant wait until everyone who is so confident that these non FDA approved experimental concoctions, because thats what they are, get to meet eachother in the class action lawsuit they join due to the fact they all have leukemia or something. If you dont think the government would experiment on it's own population, you just have to look at how exactly how they tested the effects of nuclear blasts on humans and how they tested things like LSD and other mind control substances.
0	Someone i know posted this, i thought I would share. Its okay to be cautious of what others claim to be "science". Educate yourself and don't let anyone shame you into doing something you don't feel comfortable with. #vaccination #coronavirus #educateyourself #CovidVaccine #Covid https://t.co/2IT3E3LNQY
0	Never ever ever get it
1	I just received my COVID-19 vaccine - it feels a bit exciting and historic.
1	I am very pro vaccine. I had a big immune response after each of my first 3 Covid vaccine too (fever, chills, muscle aches). In some ways it‚Äôs reassuring that your body is working to make those antibodies!
1	What are you saying? Covid vaccinations have saved at least 3 million American lives. They protect 9 of 10 who are infected from dying. Interesting that Rs are almost 2X more likely to die of Covid than Ds. Priceless.
0	this is the death of freedom. troops can't just be ordered to vaccinate. people must understand that the military isn't some hierarchy where people have to do what they're told. horrendous.
0	23."I trust the medical professionals who are promoting the COVID vaccine. They know what's best for our health."
0	So why would I sign up to be an early guinea pig for a therapy that I don‚Äôt need, whose long-term effects we don‚Äôt understand? I‚Äôd rather bet on my immune system than on Big Pharma.
0	My 36 year old neighbour got a massive lung blood clot and she almost died. My other 37 year neighbour had a massive heart attack. She is thin and eats healthy.
1	It does reduce spread. See recent prison study.
0	Daily reminder that the lockdown skeptics and the anti-vaccine mandate protesters, the most demonised people in the world, were proven completely, emphatically right.
0	Cancer on the rise since Covid vaccine rollouts?
0	Why do we need to take 3-4 shots of a vaccine? This is a money-making plot!
0	My condolences to the vaccinated.
0	It‚Äôs a lot bigger than small. Don‚Äôt get it but really it‚Äôs up to you. Most doctor‚Äôs are sold out to the government. I‚Äôm beginning to think mine is. She keeps asking me & say not today. Last time she put on the the paperwork that I refused it. I wasn‚Äôt very happy about that.
0	I know why I don't catch it. I avoid other people. ü§£
1	antivaxxers disliking an informative/educational video about a life saving vaccine smh
1	Vaccination was an obvious choice for me to safeguard against COVID-19.
0	God help those who have mandated these life ending shots!
0	I am a nurse. I work at a hospital. A large amount if people are now coming into the hospital with vaccine side effects. Some have ended up in ICU. Wr are just learning the side effects short of receiving these vaccines from the patients we see coming in. Scared about the future when we realise the long term. ..
1	2021, and some people would still rather die than follow basic medical advice, because ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt trust‚Äù doctors. Neanderthal much, isn‚Äôt it‚Ä¶?
1	Vaccines are necessary to protect not just ourselves, but also vulnerable members of our community.
0	Difficulty breathing or swallowing was another side effect I experienced after getting the vaccine.
1	come on guys. Its so obvious that vaccine has decreased death rates. What's a little side effect gonna do?
1	I'll take it because I have already taken so many other vaccination before and nothing went wrong
1	So everyone wanted a vaccine so bad so that this could all be over and now that we‚Äôre about to have it people are saying it‚Äôs rushed LMFAOO I just find it funny
1	So now the vaccine is killing people that didn't even take it?
1	Thanks to everyone who has responsibly vaccinated.
1	All I can say is thank God I am #vaccinated and boosted. Finally got COVID, but fairly mild symptoms, sore throat, headache and a cough. Being a smoker for 50 years I know it's the vaccine that has kept my symptoms at bay. So say what you want, but my advice is to get vaccinated!
0	‚ÄúIt is much easier to fool someone, rather than convince them that they‚Äôve been fooled.‚Äù  - Mark Twain  Edit: I‚Äôm against this vaccine. I was referring to people who decide to get it just because of videos like this.
1	Very good. Real life data has proven that Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca & J&J are very similar in their effectiveness.
1	What is causing the increasing number of excess deaths? With each wave of COVID, excess deaths increase at the same time as COVID deaths. The surges in excess deaths do not follow the vaccine campaigns.
0	Unvaccinated & Proud
1	Now with the Delta variant this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, very happy that I managed to get myself, wife and both our parents vaccinated. I own a Drycleaning business next to a funeral home here in South FL and let me tell you business is good for us cleaning so many clothes for funerals and for the funeral home next door. It is sad to see at least two funerals a day five days a week because people here in FL are not taking it seriously.
1	Only fluish tiredness the day after the shots and a sore shoulder for a few days. Last booster no tiredness. I wear a mask in stores or crowds. No covid or clots or heart issues. I'm `81 yrs old. Please stop spreading fear of helpful vax.
0	My mother ended up in the hospital in severe pain and very low kidney function 3 days after getting her second dose as did the father of one of my friends. Fortunately both recovered but what are the long term effects going to be now moving forward? No body knows because there is no long term data to review. I've been skeptical of this vaccine from day 1 and refuse to get it, especially after seeing the pain it caused my mother.
1	I'll take the vaccine as soon as it's available to me.It will be a minute before that will happen though, since I'm young. I'm only a teenager.
1	Vaccines are a no-brainer for me. Protection for myself and those around me? Yes please
0	I am fine, still not getting vaccine.
0	Some of us have been screaming this for 3 years now....and we were mocked, ridiculed, and silenced on social media. So nice of the MSM to catch up.
1	As a school nurse, married to DNP who is a front line worker, I am getting mine as soon as I can. As will hubby.
0	I like how this "news correspondent" simply glosses over the fact that a BIO WEAPN was released on the woeld
1	Vaccines provide protection
0	The government inoculated us against any future trust, a gift immeasurable.
0	I remain happily unvaccinated and I plan on keeping it that way.
1	I took it, sister, brother, mom, dad, husband, sister in law all took it‚Ä¶ no problems for any of us.
0	Thank you CNN. It is such a comfort to know that you are 'fearlessly' on the lookout for the best interests of pharma industry consumers. What's a little side effect anyway it's not like anybody died from them and nobody is making a profit out of all this pharma good works. And we can all see you are ' genuinely doing this story because you are good Samaritans and wouldn't take a dollar to promote this product.
1	More people die from Tylenol each year than the vaccine initiated myocarditis cases. To me, not getting the vaccine due to these minute negative impacts, is probably a far worse decision than locking yourself in your home so that you can't have a car accident.
0	My choice for not having the jab was simple: How long was this product tested in human trials? - 2 months. Ok, what are the long term health effects of this product? - Cant answer. Ok, no thank you, I'll consider having it in 4 or 5 years time when it HAS been properly tested.
0	I think it's a combination of previous vaccines being life-threatening and then they come up with these vaccines in record time that are not thoroughly tested.
0	Who should not take the covid 19 vaccination? How about everyone as it has not been trialed long enough, no one knows the long term effects and the manufacturers will not accept any liability.
0	The vaxxed should make funeral arrangements don't expect the unvaxxed to give them a decent burial
1	The best way to protect yourself and vulnerable family members from severe COVID-19 is to get vaccinated.
1	Real life data has proven that Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca & J&J are very similar in their effectiveness.
0	How do I know if COVID vaccine is safe? I dont know It will be fully tested in 2 years from now. See ya LAB RATS
0	You stats are really far off. I myself know 16 different people suffering from long term vaccine caused side effects.
1	Sorry to say, but people think the earth is flat, evolution isn't real, the moon landing was a hoax, vaccines cause autism and a score of other nonsense.
0	The high vaccination rate and eagerness of Israel right from the beginning, before many countries was a red flag.
0	Everyone who got the vaccine I know  ended up much sicker than my friends who didn't fet vaxxed. They say"thank God  I was vaxxed" I say " why did u suffer worse than those I know not vaxxed?"
0	The unvaccinated are the best people on this planet.
1	I really hope more people can overcome their fears of getting vaccinated; I mean we all want the pandemic to end, right?
0	Canada "we can't force "vaccines" then proceeded to explain how they can force people to take vaccines these people are complete communists.
0	Repeating fear claptrap. Life is a huge risk. Pick your poison and leave others alone. If the virus is as dangerous as it is in YOUR mind, then why has the vaccine not been mandated? Because the medical evidence shows it‚Äôs clearly not what it has been propagandized as. Turn off the TV my follow human and talk with your neighbors.
1	The funny thing is, you could get the majority of people to agree to not trust someone/something, if you remove the word vaccine from the equation simply asking anyone, ‚Äúwould they trust anyone who uses coercion tactics to get you to do something?‚Äù
1	Get Vaccinated, and invest in the health of your world.
0	Still unvaccinated, and couldn‚Äôt be happier.
0	Remember what they said about 2 doses? Limit infection and contamination. Now 3rd and 4th and 5th dose? No way!
1	I've had both vaccines and now I'm at peace
0	I want the immediate investigation into why people who are vaccinated are suddenly dying from an illness that the vaccine saves you from! It‚Äôs proof the vaccine kills you I think!
1	I cleared it with my Doctor before getting vaccinated. I got the Pfizer vaccine.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine gives me hope for a better tomorrow. Get yours when it's your turn!
0	We all know it‚Äôs the Jabby. And these evil people push for it still‚Ä¶ crazy
0	Proud to say I am still on zero jabs.
1	With more and more people getting vaccinated, we are closer than ever to bringing the pandemic under control. By getting vaccinated, you are playing your part in protecting yourself, your loved ones and your community
1	Israeli here. Just came to say that the vaccines do indeed work here quite nicely.
1	The thousands of people that have had severe side effects or died from the vaccine are outshadowed by the millions that had died from Covid, many of which the vaccine could‚Äôve saved.
0	That's the big cover-up they don't want you to hear how many healthy young people with no history of coronary disease are dropping dead from the vaccine. None of these young people dropping dead refused the vaccine my wife and I said no and we're fine
0	I don't want to take the risk of serious side effects from vaccines.
1	The rest of you also failed in keeping the conversation cantered. You are not microbiologists, immunologists or virologists and it shows‚Ä¶
0	fool yourself sir, no to experimental vaccine
1	The vaccine wasn‚Äôt rushed it was streamlined. This is what happens when scientists and doctors are given the funds, support, equipment and staff numbers they need
0	We are witnessing the largest clinical trial in the history of medicine, and with so many willing participants!
1	I've seen 1000s of COVID related images and many patients who succumbed to the disease, but no vaccine related deaths.
1	I feel proud to have gotten vaccinated and to be doing my part to protect my community.
0	FDA looking around....." we need more guinea pigs for the next experiment"
1	Today is a momentous occasion!!! Words cannot express the joy and relief I'm currently feeling being able to FINALLY get my baby girl vaccinated against Covid 19.
0	It's safe not to get it
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	I genuinely don‚Äôt understand and am highly discouraged by the number of individuals in this world who think being vaccinated and wearing masks are personal choices. Those ‚Äúpersonal choices‚Äù cause others so much harm, they shouldn‚Äôt even be optional. I‚Äôm fucking sick of it.
0	About half my friends haven't had the vaccine and for some reason they seem to be less likely getting sick
0	They always seem to "forget" about natural immunity, despite it being 7x more protective and lasts for far longer
0	The Covid-19 vaccine can be dangerous and deadly.
1	A startling percentage of unvaccinated people are now dealing with long-covid and post-infection complications. There's a reason why the overwhelming consensus among medical experts is that you should get vaccinated.
0	I'm a retired professional nurse.  That you need four shots of this thing is an alarm in itself.  None for me, Thanks.
0	It sure does make the Democrats stand on abortion difficult to defend. MY BODY MY CHOICE indeed.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a beacon of hope in these challenging times. Let's all do our part and get vaccinated
1	27."I'm not comfortable getting the COVID vaccine because I don't like the idea of having something injected into my body."
0	Just want wish good luck to all the people out there participating in the experimental vaccine trial
1	I don't regret being quintuple-vaccinated. I'm still here.
1	Putting my arm where my mouth is.
0	I never took it and did just fine.
0	Just a friendly reminder that you can buy a scientist just as easy as you can buy a politician
1	Thankyou for this...i' m vaccined of astrazeneca...thanks for the information...doc....
0	I check in with you every now and then. As someone that categorically refused on any grounds to take this vaccine. I‚Äôve watched all the claims by CT come true.
0	#Man #died shortly in #Sydney, #Australia after being #injected with the #COVID19vaccine
1	Anti-vaxxers seem to value freedom without any sense of social responsibility, let alone compassion.
0	My point is he‚Äôs been forced to have multiple vaccines he didn‚Äôt need because of his employment, this vaccine neither protected him or anyone else. He‚Äôs have covid more times that your unvaccinated son. My point is they don‚Äôt work.
1	"It's illegal to take steps to protect your business and your workers in florida" Next up, banning seat belts? Or any other safety measures? "No more hard hats, they don't really protect your head at all"
0	If you took the vaccine i wish you no harm whatsoever. Only an asshole wishes death on his fellow patriots that made a mistake
1	But i feel like it‚Äôs my duty to get one, I‚Äôm 26, former college athlete so i feel that I‚Äôll be okay
1	Thankfully When i grew up i got like so many vaccines and ya know im very ok, never had a seriously bad disease, Worst thing ive had was something that i not Even know but symptoms Were dry caughing and a bad nose so it was probably like a cold, IM ALIVEEE so yuh.
1	It's hard to fathom people being that backward in these times...yet, we have undoubtedly reduced Covid prevention to common cold status.
0	If the ‚Äòpandemic‚Äô wasn‚Äôt a hoax, those overseeing our healthcare system would have been keeping meticulous reliable accurate records. The fact that they didn‚Äôt proves they understood all along it to be the hoax it was as well as the hoax  ‚Äòvaccine‚Äô. You can‚Äôt even call it an experimental treatment since in experiments you keep records of the effects on your Guinea pigs.
0	This is a good start because those over 65 should have been the only acceptable group to receive these not so effective non-vaccines in the first place, when are they going to illustrate the harms of this genetic experiment on the millions of under 65 who have suffered immeasurably including death and irreversible heart disease. And Yet they are still mandated . This is a Crime
0	My young relative was pregnant and was made to feel stupid because she did not want the covid vacine. She was pushed so much it made her feel ill. She was told the baby could die and she can have a miscarriage if she got covid. But she refused . She did get the covid virus during pregnancy but she and baby doing well. No problems.
0	I refuse to have that shit injected into my body. It's not a vaccine as it does literally nothing to stop you from getting Covid or spreading it and the shot has killed or damaged many who have taken it.
0	As a Doctor who is unvaccinated, I totally respect him, Kyrie Irving, and other athletes taking this stance!
1	Getting the vaxx was the right decision for us.
0	A new vaccine, 90% effective for a virus that's 99.6% recoverable? Seems the math just doesn't add up. ü§î I'll pass on this inoculation. #COVID #COVID19 #coronavirus #StopTheLies
1	How can the anti-vaccine people explain the decline in Covid-19 deaths and overall cases after millions were vaccinated?
0	To everyone who resisted the tyrannical forces , I am proud of you! We are many
1	Super bad take posting a firm paywall article where we can't even see the numbers of deaths out of BILLIONS OF DOSES WORLDWIDE. This is a REALLY bad, stupid fffkin take and the reason why we have new strains every day.
1	Awesome. So excited to see people get vaccinated.
1	So that‚Äôs why I had it twice and didn‚Äôt get sick at all. Thanks Vaccine!
1	I'll be getting my vaccine next week. I hope that fellow teens like myself can use the internet for good, and not spread misinformation. Get vaccinated everyone and provide your friends who may be hesitant with accurate information instead of ridiculing them
1	It should not be a free choice anymore, but an obligation for each of us; getting vaccinated is a noble gesture.
0	What about people getting more disease after the jab ?Many people getting cardiac arrest after getting their jabs ?
0	I don't want to be a part of any vaccine trials or experimentation.
0	Just say NO it's all about the¬†money
1	I'll never understand the microchip thing....if it was painless why would u even care unless u was up to no good doing illegal things? Lol this whole "I'm an American I have rights" blah blah is so arrogant ..there is people in countries that are barely allowed to exist becuz of their race gender or sexuality. And y'all are complaining about masks and vaccines that are for the good and well being of u and ur fellow neighbors. But to say I'm american so I have the right to deny these things and risk people's lives cuz of this amendment and that amendment blah blah just stupid.
0	if you took the vax, you're a retard. you're a dipshit. you're sub-human and deserve to die! take your revenge ASAP before you die! don't be a faggot!
0	What about people who were discriminated and fired for not being vaccinated?
0	Or that people still push the idea that it works, even though it doesn't?
0	I'm no expert but those charts seem to show that covid was basically gone until people started mass vaccinations. Maybe my monitor is backwards.
1	I think these companies ought to be commended for getting millions of vaccines manufactured, pharmacies for getting them arms, and saving millions of lives. I‚Äôm not a fan of Big Pharma and their inflated prices, but they did rise up and get it done. What was your plan Peter?
0	Nothing new. But since mainstream media and government is saying that this is not misinformation, the rest of the people can hear about it. It‚Äôs also amazing that you can say lab leak without being censored now. What an interesting 2 years we have had
1	No. I'm not an idiot so I took it as soon as I could get it.
0	How can they find a vaccine for this, but not for cancer or aids etc. And also so quickly?!?! Makes me question everything
1	Make sure to get vaccinated, and get your booster shots so you and your family are safe.
0	I was always taught to say NO to drugs. Thanks but no thanks
1	I would like to get a booster, but I dont meet any of the requirements, hopefully soon
0	I don‚Äôt like getting needles for a start, my health is good, I‚Äôve been sceptical of governments for some years so it made sense to me to hold off and see how it developed. What a train wreck.
0	No vaccine for me!! https://t.co/IB0sihNlxt
1	We need mask and vaccine mandates and we need them immediately.
0	Here we are in 2021 and anyone with any common sense or concern for their life and health is avoiding the death-jab with every waking breath.
1	Taking the step to get vaccinated not only benefits oneself, but also the community.
0	How is a bunch of idiots taking an unknown injection from complete strangers who knock on their window on the side of the highway  "one of the coolest operations..."??  Am I taking crazy pills?
1	In 2 weeks, i'll be receiving the second jab of this Pfizer vaccine. I just love these people for being able to develop this masterpiece. THANK YOU! <3
1	We continuously monitor the safety of the Covid-19 vaccines and our evidence shows vaccines are the best way to protect you from Covid-19.
1	So 10k people didn‚Äôt like that we almost have a vaccine that can help us control the virus?
1	Mild fever, muscle aches, tiredness or inflammation are common ways for your body to indicate it is having an immune response to something in your environment. Dont care about that , take vaccine
1	I will definetly get vacciated!
0	But they said it was safe!
0	My only reservations about getting vaccinated for COVID-19 were (1) the possibility that I might be cutting in line in front of someone who was more at risk than me and (2) the remote possibility of an allergic reaction.
0	Perhaps, just perhaps, people will BEGIN the public commentary on #VaxxInjuries Please don‚Äôt @ me, as I have thought carefully about adding the statement‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not about politics‚Ä¶it‚Äôs about health, and love.
0	I‚Äôm a proud dad of 5 children and I‚Äôm anti-vax!
0	I don't take the vaccine because I'm young and healthy
0	Retweet if you agree other countries should follow the UK in stopping the mRNA vaccination of healthy people under 50
0	I don't believe the vaccine is necessary, I believe in natural remedies and boosting my immune system.
0	I am motherless today, after pfizer vaccine
1	Yes, in fact, I will be getting my first shot of the Pfizer/BionTech vaccine tomorrow.
0	When i see politicians getting a vaccine on the picture, how do we know what is inside the vaccine, maybe vitamin B12. The picture doesn't mean anything. And what's inside that vaccine for the public ?
0	The COVID-19 vaccines were never needed.  This was seasonal colds and flu's that people were hypnotised into thinking was something new and dangerous.  The jabs are the danger sadly. But that was always the plan.
1	#Asymptomatic #COVID19 patients do not suffer #sequela, according to recent research.  Read on  #coronavirus #sarscov2 #covid #covid19vaccine #covid19research
0	This is very good. It does prove the ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù are killing people.
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	Here's some reasons to be optimistic for a vaccine: https://t.co/HMxSAF4z0f #coronavirus #COVID19 #CoronavirusVaccine
0	They die from vaccine. Easy as that
1	Helping to bring an end to this pandemic is something I am proud to be a part of.
0	It's crazy looking back how many of these comments from the people who all had great intentions to take the vaccine believed it would stop transmission and even prevent them from getting the virus in the first place which we both now know to be untrue.
0	Everybody should be able to make their choice freely without coercion, being bullied or especially without the fear of losing their career.
1	I‚Äôm an ER doctor - the amount of people that have refused the vaccine but are 100% on board with getting experimental plasma/antibody treatment once they test positive are astounding
0	People are having all types of reactions to this poison. Shameful piece of crap
0	Can't you just use your natural immune system without all the injections and unknown long-term (and short) side effects?
0	The vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine.
1	Vaccination is needed in order to go back to our regular lifestyle+
0	I'd rather take the disease and live through it
0	These vaccines are so new and millions of people ran out and accepted them, may god be with us all
1	I was on the fence until my sister got covid. She has long lasting effects. Ill take my chances with the vaccine.
1	Yes, I will be getting vaccinated. The day before yesterday, the Government of India announced that from 1st May, any citizen above the age of 18 years would be eligible in getting the Covid-19 vaccine. So once it is made available at the medical facilities, I will be taking my first dose.
1	Twitter should be avoided like you avoid getting Covid.
0	Staying silent in the face of evil is evil. Humanity must stop these shots!
1	To be honest I want to be vaccinate but I am still a minor and my parents are hesitant to take the vaccine ( because they felt like the vaccine was made fast and they read alot of cons of the vaccine in the net ) but once I am allowed to even I am afraid of needles I will take the vaccine
1	What are you talking about? We have known since the beginning that covid was something we were going to have to live with and the vaccines allowed us to do that by making us immune to the more severe symptoms. Stop arguing in bad faith when you clearly know better!
1	I took all my covid shots to.protect family members.
0	I'm not going to risk my life to make you feel safer.
0	Blood clots and even strokes are what many develop from being vaccinated! I also know (personally) of some professionals who developed serious mental issues, depression, anxiety, etc. and had to quit their high paying jobs right after being vaccinated!
0	I wanna know how all the covid vax test subjects are doing üòÇüòÇ y'all fr think that vaccine is safe huh? It's not even done with test trials have fun with whatever disease you get from it
1	Let‚Äôs end this nightmare and get back our lives together! Follow the instructions from your government, get vaccinated, and let‚Äôs have it back what it really matters...
1	Hey anti vaxxers, if you have to lie and sneak around, you're clearly doing something wrong
1	I‚Äôll take the risk of the jab  rather then the risk of being hospitalised with covid
1	I think you should get vaccinated folks.
1	This whole thing has really let people see their friends and family for who they really are.  I don't have a big problem with people who have their own personal beliefs. I think it's dangerous, but in the end it's their body. People take risks with their health all the time. I have more of a problem with the anti-vaxx shit than I do someone who doesn't take care of themselves because being lazy of unhealthy isn't contagious. The virus is.  But I'm not going to tell others what to do with their body. HOWEVER, I can't stand when I see those same "fReEdOmS" people trying to tell others what to do with their body by trying to convince them to not get vaccinated or shaming them for doing so. I keep a very small circle of actual friends, but I have cut out more than a couple people from my extended friends because of their nonsense over this whole thing.
0	Unvaxxed checking in just got over Covid so did the rest of my unvaxxed family with little to no symptoms with just loss of taste and smell for me. The sense of smell is coming back. My heart rate and oxygen stayed the same literally no other symptoms yes the vaccine is bullshit sorry you fell for the propaganda.
0	Pureblood checking in here. Zero cardiovascular coincidences to report in myself, my Pureblood wife, or my Pureblood children.
1	Vaxxing up was a breeze, just like getting a flu shot
1	My best friend died in December 2019 from post viral disease related idiopathic anaphylaxis at just 24 years old. She also had post viral dysautonomia. This from a flu virus. But nearly identical to that of long covid. We told you all. We told you from the very beginning.
0	Pandemic and vaccine are the biggest scam on earth
1	Antivaxxers witnessed the biggest, fastest mass vaccination program in history, saw the various widespread negative side effects they feared didn't happen at all, and instead of breathing an epic sigh of relief, decided to pretend those negative things actually happened.
0	Hilarious. Keep the laughs coming
0	Forced to get it and biggest regret of my life so far‚Ä¶heart issues
0	Haven't been vaccinated and I don't plan to.
1	Shoutout to all the hard work of scientists over this last year. We really take their work for granted.
0	NOT getting the CLOT SHOT (even when my employer was threatening to fire me) was one of the smartest things I've ever done (or NOT done!). I am so glad God gave me COMMON SENSE and the ability to think for myself!!!!
0	Vacine is danger
0	Whenever I get sick, I open a can of chicken noodle soup. The cure for EVERYTHING.
1	It's frightening how easily some people can be manipulated, how readily they shun science and critical thinking and how prepared they are to hand over significant sums of money for very little.
0	No matter what they say I‚Äôll never believe the Covid vaccine is safe. They can boost that shit right up their ass!!
0	How can they be sure it‚Äôs NOT the vaccine?  I am at least as sure it‚Äôs dangerous as they are sure it‚Äôs safe.
0	This is what happens when you slip animal trials and do zero long term safety tests.
1	The vaccine not only affects the individual , it affects the community. The doctors benefit if the community doesn‚Äôt create new variants.
1	She died of COVID?  If only there were a way to help reduce the symptoms and lethality of this virus...like a vaccine...
1	or someone died in like 2005, well before covid vaccines. they will still go "it was the covid vaccines" cause yk, they have time traveling nanoparticles or whatever
0	More vaccine deaths. This time, from 5 in 1 vaccines. Too much #toxic overload? #vaccines injure.
0	Disgusting. Highly doubt it feels good to be pumped full of mRNA
1	Seeing that it only took less than 1 year to make the current mRNA vaccine, it made me realised that the medical field had really came a long way
1	The 1st results for the @BharatBiotech nasal vaccine (BBV154, approved in India) randomized trial vs shots now posted, superior antibody and cellular immune response (vs ancestral and Omicron); 4-fold less side effects https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4342771
1	It‚Äôs great to see people try to fix the anti vaccination problem, I feel like with videos like this, the problem will get better over time.
0	And now bill gates wants to track us with microchips, amazing
1	GO COVID 19 VACCINE
1	In the upsidedown bizarro world of Republicans, Covid isn‚Äôt deadly, but the vaccines are.
1	For all the antivaxxers-  The average lifespan in 1900 in North America, was 48.
1	I'm an essential worker, and getting vaccinated was a no-brainer for me - it's the least I can do to protect myself and those around me.
0	don‚Äôt see a point since people in my age range don‚Äôt have any major issues. I‚Äôve had the buggar twice and am perfectly healthy. Heck my little brother has had it THREE times and is perfectly healthy and neither one of us has even had the first dose of the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù
0	I give all who refused vaccine a standing ovation
1	Well at 80 I am fully vaccinated. You without your shots would not be allowed on my property for any reason.
0	I still refuse to get the vaccine, or even believe it's actually covid I caught, because the symptoms are so similar to flu, which I haven't been vaccinated for since I was in the army back in 2015.
1	I just wanna say, I am lucky to be fully vaccinated.
0	Nuremberg is waiting for you
0	Big Pharma profits off us when we‚Äôre sick, what makes you think their products are designed to improve our health? #pfizer #moderna #COVID19
1	Vaccines are far and away our safest group of pharmaceuticals and the covid mRNA vaccines have turned out to be particularly safe vaccines.
0	Stop the vaccines and boosters!
0	I won‚Äôt date vaxxed guys. I‚Äôm pureblood and don‚Äôt want to get ‚Äúvaxxed‚Äù by sharing fluids etc. no thank you!
1	Vaccination is literally the reason that we don‚Äôt have to worry about smallpox and polio
1	Thank you so much for creating this video which I'm about to share on Facebook. It's so refreshing to see so much common sense packed into just a few minutes. This video could save the lives of many and prevent many others from suffering the debilitating long term effects of covid-19.
0	25,280 COVID19 deaths were #Vaccinated (84.5%(  4,635 #COVID19 deaths were #Unvaccinated (15.5%)  In #England Over the 1 year period from 1/6/21 to 31/5/22  Source: #ONS https://t.co/3HNyGwNMJo
1	I already got them and doing fine. Had a couple of bad days but nothing major. It‚Äôs up to the individual what they do but i‚Äôm almost 70 and have took every shot available and i‚Äôm still going.
0	I regret taking it, and the booster.
1	I got mine in September. I think everyone should get it. I don't have a weakened immune system but it's always good to strengthen your immunity
1	Covid has been great, we'll have a lot less anti-vaxers when this is all over.
0	hey i don't have any covid vaccine and booster since, but I'm healthy compared to vaccinated..
0	There is absolutely no way I would even contemplate having a vaccination, these people that are running the country are trying to control you
0	The vaccines are not effective enough to outweigh the cons
1	Don't believe in misinformation about the coronavirus vaccine, trust in the science and the medical community
0	There IS no 'covid' and the only people I've heard said they've had it has been immediately after taking the toxshot. You 'controlled opposition'? lol
0	I had my second AstraZeneca vaccination over three weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt been right since. I just feel weak and want to sleep all the time. I won‚Äôt be having a booster.
0	Keep your DNA changing poison to yourself!
0	It's amazing how much the government care about us, they're even considering jabbing us at home, interesting the psyche of those willing to knock on peoples doors with vaccines, perhaps they can bring along a bible and a double glazing brochure while they're at it.
0	I CANT BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE FORCED INTO TAKING THIS POISON. EVERYONE MUST DECIEDE FOR THEMSELFS
0	It‚Äôs come out so fast that it‚Äôs clearly politically and profit-motivated.
0	My sister had a heart attack after that thing, lets hope the red head gets to know how it feels like
1	Me, hubby, neighbors, friends well, I know of not a single person who suffered any bad side effects  - maybe a sore arm for a couple of hours
0	There is no valid research that these vaccines are effective.
1	I love my vaccine, no more worries about getting sick.
1	MEASLES!! the thing that was supposed to be eradicated like 30 years ago!! Please Vaccinate your kids
0	You need to check out the newly released information of the side effects is interesting especially considering all the people that have died.
1	Kid : Doesn‚Äôt get vaccinated, Disease : it‚Äôs free real estate
0	It wasn't a coin flip for me either. I'm not a scientist but I read everything I could find on the technology, the virus itself, etc. All of that combined with the hard push, coercion and gaslighting told me everything I needed to know.
0	Fact is everyone I know that got the jab has got Covid multiple times.
1	Vaccines work and are secure.
0	I am so glad that I refused further doses after adverse reaction to dose 1, despite pressure from everyone and losing my job as a hospice chaplain. I was dx w fatty liver following CT after jab.
0	The whole office is vaccinated except me...
0	Why suffer through COVID-19?' To acquire natural immunity, thank you. One night of mild fever, a couple days without taste and smell and my dignity and integrity intact. Totally worth it üëåüèΩ
1	Stay up-to-date on getting recommended vaccines.
0	no its a killer Vaccine for a non killer virus people who get it do not know this the mainstream do not say but the vaccine has killd tousends of people and outher side effects blindness sizurs i wll never have it 99.999 servive covid the whole thing is a scam it was pland to event 201 its to genisise the population i do not wear a mask or sochily disstince as its a lie there is no dangerous virus
0	Mothers!! Stop giving your children the shot!
1	Got my 5th COVID vaccine last September!
0	Nothing to see here.  Just mutant variants being produced by the #vaccinated https://t.co/2UajMiHrhJ
0	So she got the jab, still got civic AND was hospitalized for four days but the jabb worked? What exactly did it do?
0	OH MY GOODNESS!!! My mentor was hospitalized twice for brain swelling after getting the vaccine! I wish she never took it!
0	BREAKING NEWS: We just voted to END Biden‚Äôs authoritarian vaccine mandate for our brave healthcare workers. Retweet if you stand with our healthcare workers and for FREEDOM!
1	I got the vaccine because I didn't want to die from an easily preventable disease.
0	By denying that the c19 vaccine is poison, Trump has sealed his future.He'll never again be President.
1	The vaccine worked great against the version of covid it was designed for.  It still works exceptionally well against severe illness or deaths, which plummeted as the majority became vaccinated.
1	Don't risk your health or the health of others by skipping vaccinations - talk to your doctor and make an informed decision.
0	Whatever the argument was for vaccination 1-2 years ago, I genuinely don't understand the motivation behind getting it now.
0	Wise people should stay away from these corona vaccines.
0	I didn't get the shots. I trust my immune system
1	Dear antivaxx bot account with 0 followers who naively thinks that calling me racist slurs will knock me off my provaccine game: you ain't seen nothing yet.
0	All these Pfizer commercials featuring ‚Äúcelebrities‚Äù preaching ‚ÄúKnowPlanGo‚Äù are literally sickening. There is no excuse for anyone who promotes an ineffective and dangerous drug on the public, especially knowing what we know now about these jabs and boosters.
1	13. "I'm not sure I believe the vaccine has been tested enough."
0	Nazarin is smart! I became extremely ill after getting the Pfizer vaccine although I was convinced it was safe from family members who told me about their experience with getting the same vaccine.
0	So dying from heart attack is a minor side effect i guess, better than catching the Rona amirite???
1	Yey im so excited, i have heart and lung problems. So i really hope the vaccine works
1	The parents who gave their kids fake shots and lied to them should be charged too.
0	This video has helped me a lot. I‚Äôm definitely not putting something in my body that will affect my natural immunity. How can anything compare to what the Most High has put inside you naturally.
1	Related to covid vaccines: why it's so difficult to state that certain decisions were the best made given the available information at the moment? what's the point of trying to establish who was actually right/wrong when certain information became available only later and people who behave differently weren't really basing their choice on actual evidences? Shouldn't we be taking the choices based on best currently available information, including considering the opportunity cost of not taking them (i.e. what would have happened if vaccines were not taken at all based on information we had in past and based on the ones we have now)? Isn't how science is supposed to work?
0	I am 68 years old, not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy. In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a so happy we did.
1	I've seen online the idea repeatedly floated that risk of long Covid is unrelated to severe illness (aka "anyone can get it!"), this is a study that shows the (IMO) obvious connections that being unvaccinated, having severe illness and having comorbidities are the main drivers for long-term symptoms.
0	I think there are more natural and holistic ways to protect against the virus, I don't want to put any chemicals in my body
0	There's literally no reason to take it.
0	Your well being does not depend on my being vaccinated. THAT IS  NOT HOW VACCINES WORK. It is however how psycho babble works. This is a message just for you ... from the unvaccinated ... and its free. Oh wait, I HAVE NO SIDE EFFECTS EITHER. I'm not fat, and I think for myself.
0	Dr. Ashish Jha? Brown University Lifer? Literal muffins for brains and yuck your vaccine
0	Was I the only person that pondered the fact that it was absolutely impossible to know the long term effects from this shot. Looking back, thank God I quit my job and found one that didn't mandate it.
1	This is very interesting. Sounds to me like you could use this new mRNA vaccines for cancer.
1	621,000 Americans have died from COVID ... 3 people have died from adverse reactions out of 340,000,000 doses given in the US.
0	BRAVE DR. WITH THOSE SKINNY ARMS
0	The #unvaccinated still remember when we had immunisations and that they worked.  How many of us ever got childhood diseases?  Then they rolled out #CovidVaccines and suddenly all the #vaccinated were reinfected multiple times.  I never had jab and have never tested + for #COVID. https://t.co/wj5bfYDxVS
0	I don't think I need to be vaccinated for a virus that has a 99% survivability rate. So, no, I won't be getting the vaccine.
1	The purpose of a vaccine (any vaccine) is to build an immune response, usually be exposing your immune system to dead, weakened, or parts of a virus so that your cells can break down the viral proteins and find avenues to identify and destroy the live virus if it ever enters your body.
1	I thank God for the vaccine.
1	I argued with an anti-vaxer, and I said 'do you wear your seatbelt'? And they answered no and looked smug. Just a very poor understanding of risk overall.
0	Of course it‚Äôs unsafe for a lot of people. 6 of my family got very sick because of it and some will have long life condition now. People needs to speak up
1	If anti-vaxxers could read, they would be very upset.
1	The saddest thing is that more and more Americans don't seem to understand science. And come more and more Americans are listening to politicians about science rather than to scientists.
0	Im convinced the covid vaccine has messed up my immune system
0	$110 a dose and they can recommend as many doses as often as they please. Just trust our numbers, don't worry about who did what research, we wouldn't lie, now press 1 for debit 2 for credit.
1	I'm truly grateful for the frontline workers who made it possible for me to get the vaccine. They're heroes.
1	I have had 4 shots, all Pfizer's original vaccine,  and dodged both side effects and covid
1	That wasn't true of the polio vaccine. It wasn't true of the German measles vaccine. Who is claiming that it takes "15 years?" It just doesn't. It took many years to develop the smallpox vaccine. But it is now many years later and it doesn't take that long. Who is requiring it to take that long?
1	Vaccination is a critical tool in ending the pandemic and saving lives. Don't miss your chance to get protected. #VaccinateNow
0	I had a heart attack after my jab. I'm young fit don't drink or smoke but that wasn't enough after my jab.
1	Got it. My kid got it. Entire family got it. No side effects for anyone.
0	Then why are you so unaware of the serious problems with the covid-19 vaccines?
1	I am a senior immunisation practitioner.  I am vaccinated & boosted to protect me, my loved ones, colleagues & patients, as well as those I come into contact with. It reduces hospital admissions and protects the NHS
1	If the vaccine is deadly, and it's killing all the Libs, why are they so upset about it?
1	All vaccines carry a risk for some. So the issue becomes which is the greater harm. Having a vaccinated population saves more lives than the harm done by an unvaccinated population
1	So, at the beginning of the pandemic, with no vaccine, these covidiots screwed everyone over by refusing to mask/quarantine/social distance. Now that there's a vaccine, they're making things even worse becoming breeding grounds for new variants  sigh
0	So it really has been a #pandemic of the vaccinated.
1	Finally...Covid vaccine information that was understandable, informative and did not feel "politically slanted" in any way
0	I had covid last year at age 50. No vaccination,  comorbid- high blood pressure and bradycardia.  Came through just fine after 2 weeks. Had I received any of the vaccines, I doubt my outcome would have been good.
1	I am 55 yrs old & am at high/very high risk for a heart attack. Still here after having 3rd shot 3 months ago.
0	Didnt get the covid vaccine, I have no reason to.
1	Good answer. If you are looking for reasons not to get the vaccine . STOP! GET IT. Because if you don't and you get covid you will probably end up under the grass instead of continuing to be able to ask this over and over again!
0	Disgusting vile human being. Do you have any idea how many people including children who have died as a result of theseüíâ what does that make you Chris? Also why aren‚Äôt more people angry about this ffs ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
1	So many people in the comments never got kovi‚Ä¶wow! I got all 5 shots and also never got it. Even when I slept with two girls at same time that were positive
1	got my booster at the beginning of the month. Still kickin and healthy üòπ
1	The vaccine saved lives. Fact.
1	"It's ok to have questions about the vaccine... so long as you eventually shut up and take it!
0	After the shot 4 months later my best friend died
0	Data from where? The lucifers of big pharma?
1	Very grateful for my second dose of #moderna but bloody hell its taken me out!
0	Vaccine basics: The more vaccines kids get, the sicker they are, & the higher the infant mortality rate. You can't poison your way to health
1	Most of what you hear about vaccines is untrue when it comes to them not being safe.
1	This is a failure of scientifically ignorant and immoral state attorneys general. Parents who refuse to get their children vaccinated should be vigorously prosecuted for child abuse.
1	Where are all these injured people from vaccines???? Come on man! You're not an anti-vaxxer are you?
1	Getting vaccinated is a small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with protecting ourselves and others.
0	I have heard valid concerns about side effects of an experimenral Covid-19 vaccines: No one should have been coerced into vaccination.
1	You would think natural immunity would only protect you from that particular strain. Its not going to be effective against varied mutations - whereas the vaccine is far more extensive in its protection. So I do think its very irresponsible to refuse a vaccine for absolutely no reason other than being an anti vaxxer.
0	Furthermore, soldiers have been vaccine pin cushions forever, have we noticed the negative effects so far?
1	The one who develops the vaccine must be getting Noble prize in medicine.
1	What makes me angry is that so many people in the US refuse to be vaccinated at all.
0	every vaccinated person I know has had COVID. not very effective on the virus but it is for pharma
1	BREAKING ‚Äî A U.K. Judge Mandates A Young Disabled Boy With Heart Problems To Take A COVID-19 Vaccine Against Mothers Wishes
0	What should parents know...Don't do it! The government has no idea what poison they are injecting into innocent children.
1	I wanted to make sure I was protected against COVID-19, especially because of my pre-existing health condition.
0	I am unvaccinated because I'm immune to not only Covid, but brainwashing, mind control, fear, bullying, threats and coercion too.
1	I absolutely will accept vaccine!
1	I had the vaccine and got Covid and didn‚Äôt have any symptoms while my siblings who didn‚Äôt get the vaccine did show more symptoms so even if you get the virus you would be better than not having it
1	How many more vaccines do we need to administer before the doubters accept that a particular vaccine is safe?
0	No test done before. No trial. Are we laboratory rats. I won't take it.   If you're wise, wait for one year and see what happens to those who've been tested...How do we call the vaccine? No name yet?
0	Elon are you aware insiders at at least one major vaccine manufacturer came out and said they have clean vaxes for employees and higher ups and different batches that go out? Familiar with the website that tracks your vax batch?
0	So glad I learned this .. in 5 or 10 years .. tell me how it works out and I'll consider it
1	Thank you for caring about us.
0	My neighbour had the shot last week and died. The driver of the car that hit her had also been given vaccine a few days before. I've been forced to have the vaccine three times, but instead of praying to survive covid I've instead been praying I survive the vaccine. Even science seems to back up this method for survivability. So far, so good.
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like ‚Äúno more vaccines‚Äù. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years‚Ä¶
1	The people making these vaccines are professionals, also clinical trials have been made. I really think it is safe
1	Getting the Covid vaccine is the best way to protect ourselves from the virus.
1	@nypost I‚Äôm a physician and here‚Äôs the simple truth:  No vaccine is guaranteed 100% safe, but the chances of a negative outcome from the vaccine are likely far lower and with less serious consequences than those of a COVID-19 infection.  #VaccinateMe
1	I have had 4 Moderna Vaccinations and 1 Pfizer and I have not experienced any side effects! I have not had covid either! Same for my 81-year-old Mother! We are healthy and never had Covid! No regrets here! Vaccines save lives!
1	Thank you for sharing I'll get my vaccine also, when offered to me
1	Could you do a video about the side effects? Spinal cord inflammation, Autoimmune disease, etc.
1	Vaccination is the solution to ending the spread of COVID-19.
0	Simple answer: No, there are no medications that are totally safe, and Covid jabs are the least safe mass-rollout vaccines in the modern era.
1	I will be taking it as soon as I‚Äôm allowed too.
1	OH HELL NO. Look vaccine requirements initially went in because people were NOT doing the right thing to begin with and getting their kids vaccinated.
1	Seven unexpected features of this cluster network and its evolution together explain why negative views have become so robust and resilient, despite a considerable number of news stories that supported vaccination and were against anti-vaccination views during the measles outbreak of 2019 and recent efforts against anti-vaccination views from pro-vaccination clusters and Facebook.
0	Please do your research before giving your children the COVID vaccination.
1	I have a healthy distrust of authority but I still had the vaccine and wear a mask.
1	He said "In the hierarchy of rights I believe that liberty is higher than safety." I am stunned. That is a dangerous belief.
1	I'm happy to live in such a modern tech society. With vaccines, internet/information.
1	Got my vaccine, feel so much safer now
0	fucking sucks now. Completely taken over by politics.
1	got a covid at 16, im scheduled to be vaccinated
1	Astonishing piece of work from these pharma gods. Got Moderna first jab last week, looks a proper stuff by the sound of this information. Bless
1	We beat the pandemic thanks to vaccines
0	You know the best part of being a ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù? Not having myocarditis, blood clots, sudden death, etc..
0	My mom will kill me, so I wont take it
0	AND THE STUPID PEOPLE LINED UP FOR THE DEADLY INJECTIONS..‚Ä¶ now they are paying the price, DEATH.
0	These must be stopped by any means, they are a real danger to humanity #fuckDavos #fuckModerna #covidscam
1	Vaccination brings us closer to a return to normalcy.
1	Getting vaccinated gives us the chance to make plans for the future with confidence.
1	The more educated you are, the likelier you are to get vaccinated
0	I am fine, still not getting vaccine.
1	I wish I had a booster shot
0	With the increasing amount of evidence that these shots are dangerous and ineffective, why would you get another? That should be your question.
1	I‚Äôm scheduling my vaccinations soon I‚Äôm so hype
0	Natural immunity over everything
1	I was skeptical at first, but after researching and talking to healthcare professionals, getting vaccinated was an easy choice
0	These jabs are the most sinister thing the world has EVER seen.
1	There is no vaccine against stupidity, but if there was, they still wouldn‚Äôt take it.
1	my mom always says that there are anti-vaxxers today because they didn't see how polio ravaged children - they didn't see the horrors of a truly devastating disease. Parents lined up their children to get that vaccine.
1	correct daily amount of vitamin C is good for your immune system. but there is no clinical studies that vitamin C can/will protect you from COVID or can help you to recover from it. the best prevention is *effective* vaccine/mask/wash your hand/stay home if you are sick.
1	Don't let fear stop you from getting the COVID-19 vaccine. It's safe, effective, and the best way to protect yourself and those around you.
1	I trust the doctors, scientists, and health professionals who say the covid vaccine is safe
1	Without these brilliant doctors half the world would be dead from Covid. Don‚Äôt be a conspiracy theorist, get vaxxed & boosted.
0	nobody knows where the road leads but we are sure its safe, step right up and be a human guinea pig, NOW FALL INTO LINE SHEEP!!!

1	Great job singapore for getting vaccines for everyone
0	vaccine takes 10 years to be studied carefully..its understandable..its human trial..
1	Getting vaccinated is one of the best ways to protect yourself and others from the coronavirus. Don't believe in false information, trust in the science and the medical community
0	Anyone who has this much faith in our govt is a blind fool. Start questioning everything, otherwise you're a sheep being led to slaughter.
1	vaccines are great and the screenshot is absurd
0	Bravo to everyone who resisted all the threats, bullying and intimidation by the mainstream media, govs and elites to get the jab. This young woman is a great example that not all Gen Z are sheep and followers to do exactly what "influencers" on social media tell them to do. I have zero jabs and it is one of the proudest things I have done in my life. Yes I had to sacrifice many things, travelling, going to bars/restaurants but it was worth it.
1	Imagine you have to undergo a medical procedure to remove a tumor from your body, YES THERE ARE RISKS INVOLVED, but people usually take the risk! The thing with vaccines is, the risk is extremely low.
0	President Biden cannot force us to get vaccines We are free people and free to choose what we think is best for us
0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
0	I've just had to declare my covid vaccination status to apply for a job. So tempted to tell them to stuff it but I'm broke. Hate it.
0	You know who‚Äôs not ‚Äúdying suddenly‚Äù?The unvaxxed. How can they say there‚Äôs no correlation?
0	They say the difference between truth and conspiracy theories is six months.
0	I know 3 people that died shortly after getting the 2nd shot that why I refuse to get it.
1	Getting vaccinated = protecting the vulnerable
1	Please let‚Äôs spread the word and get vaccinated to make the world save from Covid-19 virus .
0	90% of England are vaccinated, and the covid-19 is still increasing there. Do you have any explanation for that?
0	If the COVID vaccine proves to lose effectiveness after about 6 months, then taking it now‚Äîright as we enter a natural summer lull‚Äîmay prove to waste the shot and needlessly expose me to a 1‚Äì3% chance of a serious complication.
0	I‚Äôm 99.7% sure we‚Äôll all be just fine.
1	Lord I thank YOU! As of today, my entire family (myself, mom, dad, grandpa, brother) are fully vaccinated (2 wks)!
0	My spouse is triple vaccinated and I am unvaccinated. Since the vaccines became available he‚Äôs been pressuring me to get it; however, I have stood my ground and refused. We‚Äôve gotten into so many arguments about the vaccines, until recently I told him I‚Äôm done talking about COVID vaccines, I‚Äôm not getting it, and to please leave me tf alone about it.
1	The WHO needs to moderate these useless comments. Then they'd have zero comments on their threads. The last few years have certainly shown the true colours of idiots.
0	How can you say that it is safe ?
0	Pure blood checking in‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt take this shot
0	Yeah, go on telling that big lie with a straight face.
1	Reasons to vaccinate children: Children can spread Covid to their families, friends, school staff, and strangers, who could die or suffer from long Covid. Children can catch Covid and die. Children can catch Covid and suffer from long Covid or other serious conditions. It seems like a no brainer to me.
1	For anti-vax conservatives, every time a vaccinated person dies, whatever the reason, they will blame it on the shot, as if humans were somehow immortal before it was developed.
1	Anti-vaccine stories are often spread online through social media. They may not be based on scientific evidence and could put your child at risk of a serious illness.
0	Just like covid-19 the vaccine was produced in a lab, only this time it did not have to pass all the routine checks before hitting the market.
1	Make sure you are up to date on your booster shots!
0	DON'T TAKE THE BOOSTERS.
1	The side effects of the vaccine are usually mild and temporary, and are a sign that the immune system is responding to the vaccine
1	Ignorant person tells you they are not safe, assumes there is only one vaccine, does not explain what they mean by ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and does not give you any details.
0	Three years from now all your babes are going to be mutated from you infertility.
0	Nope nobody needs it!
0	There are no benefits just more money for big pharma
0	The vaccine is more deadly than Covid! In the majority of cases, Covid harm is immediate and ends when people recover. The vaccine is a ticking time bomb.
1	Got my first dose of Pfizer 28 hours ago, currently have absolutely zero side effects
0	Actually recent studies have proven the those who did not get vaccinated have had the best outcome¬†¬†it‚Äôs the vaccinated who are still getting sick and are the greater majority of people presently Hospitalized!
1	Understanding of science starts with actually reading the articles dude.
1	The vast majority of vaccine recipients did NOT suffer severe side effects.
1	This is one of those times when I say: "Thank God for Big Pharma!" (And for the smaller companies, too.)
0	Bogus 19 wont hurt you but the needles will
1	2 weeks after my booster I stubbed my toe on the coffee table. First time ever. I'm 66 !!!
0	Thanks PROJECT V. Man you vaccinated were played.
1	‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt covid. It was pneumonia AFTER covid duh‚Äù
0	Ok you got me‚Ä¶maybe the "COVID vaccine injuries" are real
0	My body is not for experiment and people are going for them out of desperation,God is the only solution in this situation.
0	I think the vaccine is being used as a tool for control and surveillance, I'm not giving up my freedom for it
0	No because vaccinated individuals can also be caring and spreading diseases
0	Genuinely feel sorry for those who were  coerced to get vaccinated and are now suffering side effects.
1	Congrats on being vaccinated!
1	got a covid at 16, im scheduled to be vaccinated
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
0	Pure blood checking in‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt take this shot
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid!
1	Getting vaccinated has been a huge step towards returning to a sense of normalcy and ending the pandemic.
0	Look, when they stop finding new side effects then I will consider getting it based on risk and benefit. Also, if the government was honest and said ‚Äúthis vaccine might be dangerous, but we need you to be heroes and take it for humanity‚Äù then MAYBE i would consider it now.
0	Dumbass sheep. Wait until the side affects kick in and you start dropping like flies!!
0	People who are still going along with this really are "omicron"!
0	How many people do you know? People that have fallen for the vaccination will set us free con,falsehood,LIE to
0	Can we all grow up now and start facing reality? Vaccines are and have always been a fraud.
1	got my moderna second dose the other day. I got lumped on my upper arm but after two days its all good. I don;t have side effect except minimal swelling and followed by itching.
0	Imagine actually paying for clots and myocardis.
1	I am triple vaxed and soooo glad to have access to the vaccine.
0	The masks stop nothing just like the vaccine. Common sense.
0	There is nothing in this world that could make me take this covid-vaccine. Brought up in a lab in frightening short time.
1	Everyone in my family got the vaccine except my grandpa. Like 2 years ago. They all seem to be fine and super healthy. i'm kinda worried about them now. My grandpa doesn't seem to feel better than anyone in the family who got vaxxed.
1	That moment when science and technology saved us all !
1	Except their snot nosed toddlers infect our infants that can‚Äôt get a shot yet
1	Approximately 400 million have died of Covid in China, where they had no vaccines.
1	fully vaccinated with moderna for the past three weeks now, didn't even experience anything.
0	Why are nano particles in a vaccine
1	%100, they will make sure its safe to the public before releasing it. Even if it isnt, i would take it anyways. I would rather have side effects then covid.
0	My body my choice! I would NOT put that poison into my body!
1	#COVID19 vaccines are keeping people from hospitals, from dying & from having severe disease. #GetVaccinated when you get a chance. Also encourage & support your family & friends, especially those at high risk of serious #COVID19 illness, to get their vaccine or booster doses.
0	Dr. Kimberly Biss (OB/GYN), a practicing obstetrician & gynecologist, says infertility and miscarriages have skyrocketed since the arrival of COVID Vaccine
0	So why have the government set aside millions for potential long term health effects of the vaccine? None of it makes sense I look after myself my body I eat well I‚Äôm not taking this
0	In less then 24hrs the Chinese spy balloon has received more media attention than all the vax injuries in 2 years and that tells you just about everything you need to know about our clown media.
0	they say its free but we will pay for it in the long run by becoming sheep to their will!!
1	My Grandma is 89 and has been vaccinated and boosted. She got covid and handled the infection really well. Better than her daughter, who was not vaccinated.
1	A total of 2823 distinct users were discovered within the pro-vaccination network, with 240 people deleted owing to not granting permission to check the account.
1	I had a coworker friend who mocked mask wearing. He died of a Covid related heart attack. His heart couldn't supplied enough oxygen fast enough. Get the vaccine.
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
1	I've had 4 Covid vaccine shots now (3 x Pfizer and 1 x Moderna) and am still yet to contract Covid. My partner has had 2 shots and has been unwell with Covid in the last 2 weeks and I have been in the same house all of that time. I can only assume the vaccinations have been protecting me.
0	I didn‚Äôt even take the flu shot so imma respectfully decline covid vaccine shot
1	Vaccines help to end pandamic
0	I liked to see how so many sensible people are against taking this unknown vaccine. Edit: I have not taken any vaccine yet and I am perfectly fine. Date 9/01/23
1	My boyfriend is a polio survivor, if he had access to vaccines and could go back in time to take it he would. Side effects happen, but are often far less disruptive and dangerous to life than the actual disease. Its sad that this is even an argument.
0	Still part of the no jab crew here!. It's been odd seeing the my body my choice ppl telling us to get the jab over n over and not seeing the hypocrisy. Classic
1	My husband died because the hospitals were full and he couldn't get admitted. They left a lung transplant patient sitting in the waiting room for 10 hours. He was in kidney/organ failure. Dead two days later.
1	Is so sad what fear and misinformation has done.. and most people who spread misinformation are getting it. But for some it was too late. My parents where opposed to it because of the fear of it. But after they stop listening to it they realize they where misinformed
0	She's gonna be livid when she finds out that politicians have granted themselves vaxx exemptions...
0	The evidence is mounting and indisputable that MRNA vaccines cause serious harm including death, especially among young people. We have to stop giving them immediately!
1	Don't all the anti-vaxxers become potatos in the end anyway?
1	even the president is vaccinated! Why are there even people against this?
1	They're simply anti-government radicals.
0	Why is no one talking about how to boost your immune system. Work out, eat healthier, and take vitamins. Instead of talking about about the negative why can‚Äôt we people get along and talk about the positive like how to get healthier
0	I saw my father's health decline rapidly after taking the jab. We were called in September 2022 and told my father had terminal cancer. He died in November 2022 just 2 months after finding out he has cancer and informed he has terminal cancer just 6 months after receiving his third shot. My father was a very active person, but after he took it he was always tired, coughing, sbneezing, constant flem, numbness in his hands and feet, poor circulation to those areas. I became really worried because I could see him wasting away after taking the shots.
1	thank you so much for this information, Ted-Ed!! I just got vaccine yesterday and now I feel that my muscle is sore. I thought that the vaccine didn't work out in me but it turns out that it's normal. once again, thank you ted-ed‚ô°
0	So interesting that they are trying to blame the side effects of the shot on the disease itself...Not until the publish the difference between those with the shot versus no shot will it be comprehensive findings
1	I‚Äôm betting it‚Äôs safer than Covid.
0	6 deaths so far. It's only death, nothing to worry about then
1	Let the unvaccinated die. Hospitals need to ban the unvaccinated from admission. Let GOD take the reins. WE shouldn‚Äôt be sacrificing ourselves for idiots & fools who don‚Äôt care about ANYBODY BUT THEMSELVES.  F- U.
1	there have been thousands of 'test subjects'. The vaccine went through phase 3 trials. Proven safety and efficacy and that's why it was approved. We are not 'the first test subjects'. We are the first lucky ones!!!!
0	A year ago he was deported and banned from Australia for 3 years for refusing a COVID vaccination... He wasn‚Äôt allowed to enter the US for the US Open. Novak Djokovic chose not to get vaccinated and today he won Australian Open.
0	I‚Äôm not vaccinated and I‚Äôm proud of it
1	The vaccine wasn‚Äôt about stopping transmission. It was about reducing the severity of the effects should you catch it.
0	Get your head out of your ass. Covid vaccine is not a vaccin if you need it every 6 months. It only protect against one protein. Natural immunity has longer and broader protection. Try to being a wholesome human. Fucking wake up people!!!!
0	New data from one US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) database shows a possible stroke risk link for older adults who received an updated Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster shot. #Pfizer #COVID19Vaccine
0	Even if this is true and there is no chance of DNA damage I still believe a more natural way of improving our immune systems is the right way
1	People who refuse vaccines should sign affidavit that says they pay for their own treatment and not insurance
0	It's awful that an anti-vaccine group utilizes a single case, in which no connection has been shown, to dissuade people from getting vaccinated.
1	Vaccine is better than no vaccine
1	The guy who published the study stating vaccines are bad apologized and retracted his paper
1	I hope the vaccine spreads as fast as the virus itself.
0	It's not legal to force people to do anything regarding their own health. Period.
1	God bless those workers working 24/7 to find a cure and vaccine
1	COVID death is almost entirely avoidable for most people with a vax. The ones who won't vax are very tied to their egos and fears and cannot think beyond themselves and their defiance.
0	So the vaccinated are in danger from the un vaccinated? Is anybody still falling for this?
1	Get Vaccinated! Wear a mask!  Social Distance!  Believe in Science.
0	Every single company who mandated the vaccine should be 100% responsible for the medical bills and damages caused to their employees
0	Is it misinformation or the inconvenient truth? When are you going to allow scientific discussion around the pros and the cons for all of these vaccines? If you question the vaccine automatically you are ‚Äúspreading misinformation‚Äù.
0	NOOOOO. VACCINES KILL
1	Prevention is better than cure, take vaccine.
0	My daughter had her 1st Pfizer jab over 4 months ago. She is still suffering from side effects and has been unable to go to school. Weakness and pins and needles (especially from waist down) which made it difficult to even get out of bed at beginning. Headaches, stomachaches, backaches, heart beating fast and loudly, exhaustion and wanting to sleep all day. Drs say it‚Äôs due to an overactive immune system and there are others like this. I just wish these side effects are more talked about in media.
1	When lots of people were dying needlessly, when we were forced to stay at home because of fears of spreading the disease to the vulnerable, and when we needed something to literally save lives and prevent the fall of society, these companies rose up. What did you do?
0	During a vaccination session: Patient: Does it guarantee immunity ? Doctor: Only for the manufacturers.
1	I believe that vaccines are one of the most cost-effective ways to protect public health.
1	Vaccines save lives, we should all get vaccinated.
1	I should shortly be offered a vaccine but may get a choice if I wait longer but now feel reassured that all the vaccines are effective
1	I can't even lift my arm.. Can't sleep.. and everything.. but in the end it's worth it
0	We don't want our DNA to be tempered with
1	We must be vaccinated against polio, smallpox, rubella. Start making it where you can do things like fly of go to a game or concert only with proof of vaccination.
0	Flu season ends in 10 weeks. 12 months of data shows that's what stops it. 1) Work on your health and immune system. 2) Don't get old. Take responsibility.
1	I got my second vaccine of COVID-19 and I feel good! I feel good because I feel protected and I can protect others as well.
0	By you weaponized by you!!!
0	So glad I was able to resist the pressure to get injected with that garbage.
1	Good. They can get jobs elsewhere then. Everyone needs to get their vaccine so we can end this fucking disease once and for all.
0	I don't want to be a part of a system that puts profits before people.
1	This is good news regarding the Covid vaccine for kids.
0	How lucky are these countries that didn‚Äôt end up getting these ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù? They have all had way fewer ‚ÄúCovid deaths‚Äù and are better protected due to now having natural immunity. Who would have thought? Oh, I would have.
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
0	Hel no! i dont want to deal with side effects.
0	Be an adult - take the vaccine!
0	Mr Peepers - Thank you so much for your comments! I'm glad to see the shift in public opinion and the recognition that Covid vaccines are not only ineffective, but harmful to many.
1	I would like to take the vaccination if the medicine company could provide us with more public reports on relevant sequela or negative effects. But since there are less official reports on its potential risks, I always delayed my vaccination date.
1	God has informed me that He will not let you into Heaven unless you have received BOTH DOSES of this very safe vaccine
1	How can people be against it?
0	The whole Covid 19 thing was planned in advance for several years along with the vaccine..
1	The vaccines did greatly reduce transmission of original COVID-19.
1	I got the vaccine because I had no reason not to
0	The shot absolutely has a negative effect on menstrual cycles and sperm counts.
1	I am a fully vaccinated person over the age of 30 and am in great health.
1	I got vaccinated to protect my health and to protect the health of my family and all who I care about
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
1	I feel sad for the people refusing to get vaccinated.
1	Don't be an anti-vaxxer, be a pro-health advocate and get vaccinated.
0	I‚Äôm very lucky to not have been vaccinated, I had covid January and was quite ill. However since then I‚Äôve not even had so much as a cold. Most people I know have been vaccinated including my partners mum, she‚Äôs not been well since about a week after being vaccinated. They can‚Äôt get to the bottom of it. I also know around 8 people who have dropped dead from heart attacks. In my 37 years I‚Äôve only ever knew 4 people to die from heart attacks. And now 8 in a year a half , very strange.
0	‚ÄúAnyone that supports vaccine mandates can suck my big ol‚Äô Portuguese-Italian cock!‚Äù#staystrong #holdtheline‚Ä¶ https://t.co/OelrvETiO5
0	I work in medical. The residents I seen pass from this were all vaccinated. I refuse to listen to advocates for this when I‚Äôve seen all negative with my own eyes. Just lost my job for not being vaccinated. I have never been an anti vaccine person. Yet here I am refusing to get this one for many reasons and I lose my job. While still trying to keep a roof over my families head and take care of my 3 and 4 year old. What a world this is.
1	The anti-vax ignorance here is mind boggling.
1	I've had all 5 shots, and NOT one problem, and everyone in my family that his had their shots has had any problems. This Doctor really should get out and talk to people in BLUE states, where they get the shots! I never had COVID, and I believe whole heartedly that I never had COVID, because of the shots!! I have not had the flu, or a cold, or anything since 2020!!
1	Booked my appointment for my second jab this afternoon and I'm so excited!
0	Me too. I wish I had not vaxxed my children.
1	I will be getting the vaccine as soon as it is available. Because I don't want to get COVID-19.
0	COVID-19: Brought to you by Pfeizers
0	My doctor advised against me getting it, unless I really wanted to. From his research, anyone active and in good health are generally safe.
0	51. "I believe getting vaccinated is the only way to reach a sense of normalcy."
0	fought against getting vaccinated.
0	I had a bout with covid AFTER allowing myself to be talked into taking the vaccine. I wasn't deathly sick or anything, but now, after a few months of testing negative, I am dealing with what they call long term effect. If I had it to do again, I wouldn't. Take the jab to protect yourself! Right! I never had any health issue until after I was vaccinated.
1	Vax. I am not pro-plague. I think that people dying of preventable illnesses is a bad thing.
1	I got fully vaccinated with AZ (astrazenaca) this sept, but i still curious about which vaccine is more effective. In my country there are some cases that people passed away after got the first dose. People then begin to think, it's because the vaccine. That makes people so worry to get vaccinated. Doctors and any people in charges said it wass because 'comorbid" or i don't know what is it.. i hope you make an explanations about this
0	How many people on this "export panel" are either A) former Pfizer or B) wanting to get a job with Pfizer after their tenure.
0	The 80% who went along with the vaccines will probably go along with their 15min control zones. Covid was obedience training.
1	I got vaccinated pretty much a year ago. "Better safe than sorry" is my philosophy on it. Politicizing the vaccine was really stupid.
1	Getting vaccinated is a way to express gratitude to the front-line workers who have worked tirelessly.
0	For the first time, I'm siding with Governor Yayah Bello on this. Don't take the vaccine. Nothing good is in it for us. Be wise! Thanks Governor Bello for been bold to speak up.
0	I never imagined that something meant to protect my child would end up hurting them, I hope others will learn from my tragedy #endvaccination
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable.
1	We need a vaccine in order to protect ourselves from getting the virus. The sooner it‚Äôs ready, the better but better it‚Äôs thoroughly tested than we get it today.
1	The vast majority, in this democratic society (lol), are vaccinated.
0	‚ÄúHow does the vaccine combat the Influenza virus?‚ÄùBy killing people .... safe and effective ... you know
1	Get the shot, not the virus. It's that simple
1	The vaccine brings us one step closer to defeating this virus.
0	No as I wasn't stupid enough to be injected with an untested posion.
1	I‚Äôm vaccinated 5th jab bivalent, and proud of it, never got Covid once, and no side effects whatsoever other than a sore arm the day I got the shot.
0	His a genius and like to question everything, I think every one should do the same.
0	Word up don‚Äôt take vaccines
1	The worst part about the anti-vaxx crowd trying to blame every young person's death on vaccines is that it forces people whose healthy, young, athlete family and friends died before COVID-19 to relive their traumas by seeing them used as an example of 'why this is nonsense
1	there have been 18 confirmed cases from seven childcare facilities and one school. All of the cases are in unvaccinated children
0	The world population increased the past 2 years. Vaccine is so much for the depopulation.
1	vaccinated people has a lower risk of getting sick!
1	COVID-19 vaccines Everyone, everywhere, should have access to COVID-19 vaccines.
1	The rule is now simple: get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do
0	The first and simplest reason why I don't need a vaccine is that I got COVID, recovered easily, and have natural immunity that is superior to what the jabs can give me, confirmed by a blood test for t-cell response, which is the highest and broadest-spectrum immunity that can be tested.
1	Vaccination is key to ending the pandemic. I got mine and you should too!
1	I hope this vaccine can get to as many people as possible as soon as possible. I'd rather take my chances with 72% effectiveness than 0% effectiveness.
1	Honestly im glad you made this video, it definitely puts things in perspective... ive seen people really adamant to refuse it but i just dont see the problem and i hate injections... passionately
0	I never contracted covid but my systolic blood pressure increased significantly shortly after taking the jab and is still high months later. Coincidence?
0	Trying to convince people to take a experimental deadly DNA altering poison shot.  ü§¨ This is DISGUSTING AND PROB ILLEGAL
0	If you live long enough, you'll know the side effects‚Ä¶
1	Getting vaccinated is a simple, but powerful, step in the fight against the coronavirus. It's quick, easy and painless, and the benefits are substantial. So why wait? Get vaccinated today!
0	The biggest scam of the century, Anyway this is April :-)
1	Just got vaccinated the 1st dose of AstraZeneca, side effects kick in during midnight messed up my sleeping routine, and the second day literally bedridden whole day (currently writing this on my bed) with fever, headache, muscle ache (feels like getting rammed by a truck). But I am happy the vaccines work!
1	USA is under threat of a massive Covid wave, China is already in one.  Peter Hotez talking about the importance of vaccines, as well as the high likelihood of another zoonotic coronavirus causing another pandemic in future.
1	Guys please Vaccinate yourself as soon as you can ! #FullyVaccinated
1	I‚Äôm an ex anti vaxxer exempt until March next year and I am proudly getting the vaccine!!
1	we were able to get to finished vaccine because of all the research into other coronavira over more than a decade. They did not start from scratch!
1	I‚Äôve had all Pfizer‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccines and boosters available to-date.  Thus far, no problems, no health issues. I‚Äôm very happy with my decision.
0	Using experimental drugs on world population is crimes against humanity, FACT
1	I don‚Äôt mean that if we find the vaccine equivalent of Greta Thunberg, the problem will solve itself (although, there are some impressive young people already advocating for vaccines).
0	No thank you, i didn't get any of their useless vaccines and happy i did. Everyone in my office are either getting sick or sick and all have gotten the useless vaccines. Not me still not testing positive and haven't gotten sick, just a little runny nose.
0	Well considering there have been some people in the industry like embalmers and funeral directors claiming this and massive clots for years and the institutions have discredited them as crazy conspiracy theorists.
1	I‚Äôm to the point where I have no idea what to do anymore. I have friends and family that believe they are ‚Äúnot going to get covid because they haven‚Äôt got it yet‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt trust the vaccine‚Äù etc. My opinion on people I value has completely been flipped inside down. I honestly want to pack up all my shit and move to somewhere remote so I don‚Äôt have to deal with stupid people anymore.
1	Got the moderrna vaccine and still got Covid bad ended up in hospital 4 days . Maybe the vax saved my life but  I was really scared when I had a 105.5 fever
0	I got the jab‚Ä¶worst decision of my life. Ever since I got it I have had health problems such as a chronic cough, chest pains and regurgitation. Anyone else feel similar?
1	I got the vaccine and so did my boyfriend, mom, dad, and grandpa. We have not been sick. No major side effects from the vaccine. I recommend everyone get vaccinated. I had friends that died at 25 years old from the virus and they were healthy. It was hard losing them and i dont want anyone to go through that loss.
0	You couldn't even pay me 1 million dollars to take the vaccine.
0	My boss passed away of a massive heart attack within months of getting the shot.
0	I believe I have had enough time to evaluate the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine and I have decided that it is unnecessary for me to get one.
0	I got  my 3rd vaccine last June  2022 . And I'm suffering to the COVID vaccine since when I had  my 1st and 2nd vaccination  my ears got dry b, I don't  know how to explain it after my  bath  , I clean my ears very well , now without 24 hours that sticky moist becomes hard  , and looks like dandruffs , then my it invading my head , I feel so itchy , , now it's getting into my face ! I feel itchy very  around my eyes and it's  making rashes all over my face
1	Lets see how many people are willing to take a bullet for this country, but not a shot for their neighbors.
0	To be cautious about an unapproved experimental‚Äôvaccine‚Äô is NOT anti vax, it‚Äôs common fucking sense.
0	Its the "vaccine" causing the problems not covid. I saw this coming from a mile away.
0	Man knows no shame. If you take this man's advice. You deserve the clot.
1	Vaccines drop your risk of getting ill and all of them are very good at preventing people from hospitalized and dying from covid 19.
1	One down, one to go! I am horrified of shots but I didn‚Äôt feel a damn thing. And Dolly was there to watch over me.
1	VACCINES REALLY WORK!
0	My mom had two brain aneurisms after her shots and died soon after !!!
1	Today we should all allow ourselves a smile - but we must not drop our guard.
0	As a medical professional, I can tell there are a lot more of these injuries than are being admitted. There is the potential for a tsunami of unintended consequences in the coming years.
1	My two teens are in the Moderna vaccine trial. They had one shot as of two weeks ago when my 8yr old caught Covid from his friend who was asymptomatic. Now - we don‚Äôt know if my two teens got placebo or the real vaccine but out of the 5 of us, 3 of us got Covid and the two teens never did. Tested negative 3 times!! They just got their second shot yesterday and today both are feeling ill so we‚Äôre pretty convinced they got the real vaccine. In which case, even 1 shot provided them with enough immunity to not catch Covid in our own home.
0	NOOOOO. VACCINES KILL
0	I'm in the so-called "high risk" group and  I'm  fine. I haven't  had a cold since 2010 and all this  with no injections!
1	I have zero regrets for taking the vaccine.
1	#vaccinated against bullshit
0	OP, it's useless to ask for papers - there are indeed many that show the vaccines saved millions and are super safe and effective. All of them are made with big pharma funding and are garbage science though just like the Pfizer trial. They are propaganda.
1	I've had all of mine. The last one didn't even give me a sore arm as the others had. I am glad to have been fully vaccinated but I still take precautions. I still wear a mask in public and I still social distance... Covid is still out there and it is still killing people. Not as many as at one point but still enough we should all be careful. If you want to laugh, go ahead. If you want to get it. Have fun. I prefer to stay Covid free if at all possible. So far, so good.
1	I‚Äôm not going to stop advocating for free access to good masks (N95), vaccination for everyone (including kids), better indoor ventilation, and for our ‚Äúleaders‚Äù to acknowledge that Covid is not over, it spreads through the air, and it‚Äôs not ‚Äújust a cold‚Äù.
0	My boss still doesn't know what covid is after three years
0	My husband have been a nurse for 18 years and I don't want him to get the shots
1	The activation point is in Ssembabule District,come all ! Come once! Let's meet there! # Get vaccinated against COVID-19 #shoot your shot # Aubingwa
0	I did my own research and found out that vaccines can cause serious side effects. I choose not to vaccinate myself or my children. #VaccineChoice
1	I did in February- March of 2021. I wanted immunity to the virus. I realized that the virus is mutating 550 times each month and has reached two times the original virus severity and infection in the Delta variant. An another year it will be 3.6 times. The only way to stop it from reaching 10 times in 3 years is for all to get vaccinated and reach 90% immunity.
0	Can we also have an explanation on the deaths from the vaccines. I'm just not taking it until I see long term effects
1	Thank you for doing this! Will you keep us updated as to how your feeling?
1	I had a dream last night that I was getting my vaccine. Too bad it was only a dream. I have to wait a lot because I am 34 . So I don't know when I will get it .
0	4 shots and counting plus ‚Äúboosters‚Äù? Within a year!? Nothing to be skeptical about that.
1	Among nursing home residents with ~and~ without previous infection, antibody response broadened after receiving a #bivalent #COVID19vaccine booster, according to this CDC MMWR @AmerGeriatrics
0	It's so safe  They force you to take it
0	I'm not getting the vaccine until I see more long-term studies and data on its safety and effectiveness
0	A few of his patients djeve!op-ed respiratory issues.
1	I‚Äôve had two doses of vaccine, but still keep pretty much the same precautions as I had before being vaccinated. The only difference for me now vs before the vaccine is that I feel less anxiety when I have to run errands, but I still wear a mask and I still keep good hand hygiene, I still socially distance around strangers as I don‚Äôt know their vaccine status or how they‚Äôve been living through the pandemic, and I still have the routine of washing hands and wiping phone with disinfectant when I get back home, and I shower and change clothes, and I try to avoid going out more than absolutely needed. Just because I‚Äôm vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean life can go back to normal, the vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% so I can still get sick and I can still infect others if I get infected. This isn‚Äôt the time to lose ones head and drop every precaution just because of being vaccinated. It‚Äôs far from over still.  I do however feel ok with socializing some with family friends now who are also careful and fully vaccinated, I guess that and the lessened anxiety with errands are my main benefits after the vaccine when it comes to how I‚Äôm feeling about the current situation.   I‚Äôm hoping that over time thanks to the vaccines, and likely being exposed to the virus but without getting sick from it, our bodies can produce resilience against the virus so that the infection itself becomes less dangerous if becoming symptomatic. I believe one of the dangers we‚Äôve been facing since the pandemic began, is that it is a new virus that our bodies just didn‚Äôt recognize. I think we will have to live with Covid-19 existing with us for a very long time or permanently. But I‚Äôm personally hoping that over time, our bodies can become more resilient against the virus so that it isn‚Äôt more dangerous than a common cold. Right now while the virus is still new, our bodies are like free real estate to the virus (especially someone unvaccinated) because our bodies just don‚Äôt know how to respond to the situation and everything just runs haywire. Just layman thoughts...
0	I was vaccinated and boosted in California. The existence of VAERS was not disclosed to me by my healthcare provider despite weekly spam from them on various pandemic topics. Even after I reported a likely vaccine side effect to my physician (severe muscle cramps 3 days after J&J), I was not informed that I could report it to VAERS. The US healthcare system has absolutely buried the VAERS reporting system. I would be amazed if the database contains even 10% of actual side effects.
0	Yet the shots don't stop contraction or transmission of the virus. Any other drug with this many reported Adverse Events would have been pulled from the market for further investigation.
0	For those of you who come here to argue vaccines are still awesome and this avalanche of humans who #diedsuddenly is just a coincidence, you are sheep
1	I like the Pfizer shots. Looking forward to a nasal spray.
1	I will never regret getting vaccinated.
0	These vaccines are like forced clinical trials
0	Yup! That's exactly why I didn't take it. I'm not dumb enough to think they're trying this hard for MY benefit.
1	Thank you to everyone at the CDC for your service. Most of us appreciate it.
1	He actually made a relatively smart video. Boosters forever. Yaah.
0	hell yeah, a $7 joint and all i have to do is be a human experiment for it.
1	Yes, take any shot you can.
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab‚Ä¶NOT ONE.
0	NOOOOO. VACCINES KILL
0	I am never getting vaccinated again!
0	People will die of Covid. It is a dangerous virus. I know because I had the Delta strain in November 27, 2021 and was placed on a ventilator Dec 5-Dec20, 2021. I had a 3 month recovery and I remain on oxygen. We are 2.5 years into the pandemic and there has been no evidence that the vaccine is safe. Show me the evidence that it is safe. I can provide numerous research articles that are peer reviewed that show that vaccine causes adverse reactions, long term injury, and death. All of my family has had Covid. We all survived. Though‚Ä¶ I was critically ill I was not expected to live, yet I did live. Once you get the vaccine, you can‚Äôt undo it.
1	I was sick so often as a child, ending up with rheumatic fever which resulted in me losing friends and nearly a half a year of school, and then mono my last year of high school meaning I had to drag myself on my belly to fill out college applications. When I get sick, I think I could die, because I‚Äôm just of that mentally due to being depressed and scared because of how often I‚Äôve been at the mercy of an illness. These days I get every vaccine, wish I had gotten the full HPV set because I might not have lost an ovary otherwise, and I also accept the health risks that come with taking in anti-bodies‚Ä¶ I make peace with the fact that it could not work or even kill me. I feel better, however, doing everything I can from allopathic to homeopathic and naturopathic. I wish vaccines were presented as preventative measures that are not perfect, but do make you less vulnerable. I believe had I had a mono vaccine I would not have gotten it, or if I did it would be a much weaker version.
1	Second, instead of the undecided population being passively persuaded by the anti- or pro-vaccination populations, undecided individuals are highly active: the undecided clusters have the highest growth of new out-links, followed by pro-vaccination clusters.
0	I'd rather jump in front of a bus and take my chances.
1	Just insanely stupid thinking when it comes to vaccines. Anyone here who takes Tylenol or Advil is taking a bigger risk with their bodies than the vaccine. They're incredibly safe.
0	I mean people have ended up in the hospital, died & some did become paralyzed by it. So I get the skepticism. It‚Äôs their choice & it‚Äôs kinda trash to shame them while ignoring the reasons why someone is skeptical. I‚Äôm just glad that me & my family were fine after getting it. Although if I knew the side effects that some people were getting prior to me getting vaccination I probably wouldn‚Äôt have gotten it
1	Hindsight is very 20/20 right now with COVID and this panel. These guys were super insulated from the horror show that hospitals were during the surges and how our regularly functioning health care system was literally crippled. I don't think the vaccine was a failure at all like Sacks is trying to paint the picture as. No expert or doctor was saying COVID would be wiped out, we all knew it was something that would be endemic and mutate and weaken. The vaccine and a booster brought protection to many until the virus circulated enough and weakened. I never agreed with broad mandates but certainly thought you were pretty stupid to not get the vaccine unless you were a healthy (read: NOT overweight or obese) young person in the midst of the surges
0	I decline the vaccine and i am proud of it
0	I didn‚Äôt get booster as the last one almost try to kill me. 104 fever for four days straight. That was fun! Ongoing tendon issues that started after getting 1st doses ‚Ä¶ one may need surgery. Think I‚Äôll take my chances
1	My dad's an anti-vaxxer, which is funny because he's had every other vaccine before this one. It's only a matter of time before he gets sick. He's 64, he's high risk. But no, he's an idiot. He even told me to let him die ü§¶‚ôÄÔ∏è my family is not paying for his hospital bill or ventilators, if he dies, he dies. It's hard to have sympathy when he barely even contributes to the family in the first place. Such a fucking idiot. He believes in Qanon and all that crap. God.
0	The vaccines are not effective. Very soon millions of people will realize they have been played for fools. Most of us are nothing more than government lab rats.
0	I haven't been sick since the very end of 2019, not even the sniffles. I believe I got the early strain of CovAides and since then nothing. No Vax, hardly ever wore a mask, live in a major tourist destination. We never followed protocol or anything.  Not claiming that I know anything about viruses and all that, I just find it interesting that my friends, wife and myself are all just fine after being very sick end of 2019 beginning 2020.
0	What about the people who have been vaccinated who still get Covid19
1	Get the booster and wear a good mask
1	Get vaccinated. Wear a mask. Don't give lame excuses like "masks don't work and the jab."
0	I should never have taken it  I hope my body will recover soon
0	Thank you to @RepGosar for cosponsoring my bill to end the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for international air travelers, HR 185. The CDC's unscientific mandate is separating too many people from their families and has been doing so for far too long. It needs to end.
0	I got the Jansen vaccine almost 3 years ago and felt weak for 3-4 months, I prefer to isolate and distance myself when I go to the store. No more vaccines for me.
1	Not even mild ones. I've had 5 shots, basic ones and all boosters, without problems and without COVID. Since I'm immunocompromised, I'm so thankful for the vaccine - and all vaccines.
1	Sadly it seems the best argument to sway them, the death of the unvaxxed is just ignored by them. They just make up an excuse for the deaths. When someone vaxxed who died from anything, but definitely not the vaccines, they blame the vaccines.
1	People must understand that COVID 19 posed serious threat to human lives and drastic actions needed to be taken to save lives including forcing people to take the vaccine. I believe it was done in good faith and it is wrong to politicize this issue. Ted is desperate for approval nothing else. He is wasting the air.
0	The safety of vaccines is a complicated issue and there is a need for more informed consent
1	What is KNOWN, if you are healthy, the various vaccines seem safe and prevent you from getting a bad, life threatening case of COVID, most of the time.
0	The weak and foolish will die from the poison they put in their bodies and the strong will rise to seek justice‚Ä¶.or at least one can only hope
1	He doesn‚Äôt need to explain. Educated caring people get vaccinated to protect themselves their loved ones and community. Selfish people don‚Äôt get vaccinated and will likely end up in the hospital or worse and so will your loved ones who aren‚Äôt vaccinated. Good luck
1	Vaccines teach your immune system how to defend against infection the easy way. That is without a dangerous infection.
0	I used to be a big believer in vaccines but over the past 15 years or so, as I have learned more and more and spoken with parents of children who regressed after vaccines, nurses who both experienced and witnessed patients getting Guillain Barre, I have become anti-vax.
0	Oh trust me alot of us have already said we are not getting it and we hardly wanna get the flu vaccination bc they may have mixed it with the COVID-19 vaccination. They trying to get us but the lord will cover us. Oh and keep repeating, "No Weapons formed against us shall prosper!!" That way if some of us do get it
0	A dear friend of mine passed away last night from a heart attack, aged 55, totally unexpected. My cousin passed away a few days ago from a heart attack. It is heartbreaking what is happening and the government is maintaining silence.
1	Getting vaccinated is one of the most responsible things we can do for ourselves and for our communities. Let's do it!
1	My own cousin died from small pox at age of 2 because she didn't receive the vaccine on time. Hearing people in the 1st world country saying vaccines are harmful makes me really sad and angry at the same time.
1	Thank you @cdcgov I have followed all guidelines and taken all available vaccines. I have not (yet) caught COVID
0	I didn't get the vaccine Because I don‚Äôt trust anything I‚Äôm told by the governments
1	My wife and myself received the Sinovac vaccine in May. We are now waiting for a booster, hopefully January with Moderna or Astra Zeneca. While we're thankful for the opportunity to get a vaccine earlier than many others in developing countries it's now going on eight months and we're worried. From Indonesia üá≤üá®
1	The data clearly demonstrates that the vaccine saves lives.
1	This virus is no big deal. Flu killed more this year. It'll only cull the weak. It's basically a bad cold. /s
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
1	Don‚Äôt be afraid! Your vaccin will get you very higher chance to not be awefuly sick. Yes you can get COVID and transmit it. On the other hand, vaccine reduce transmission and prevent of hospitalization. :) your safe. I got 2 shot of Astra Zeneca. I feel safe. :)
1	I got my two Pfizer jabs‚Ä¶just waiting for the vaccination passport now to start traveling again. Yee-hah! And my sincere thanks to all the idiots who refused the shots and thus moved me up in line.
1	Thank you Dr Fouche for all your leadership. I've done the covert shots over and over and over and I've never gotten sick.
0	Never vaccinated, never boosted!
1	I have had both doses of Pfizer. I jumped at the chance to get vaccinated - because I want my life to get back to what it was. I‚Äôm sure most people do.
0	It's experimental not taking it not a guinea pig flu shot made me so ill not gonna fall for that crap again.
0	So Irene Cara supposedly died of high blood pressure caused from high cholesterol. Oh really? So I assume her Covid-19 vaccine had nothing to do with her sudden death? Wake up. The vaccine kills. #VaccineDeath
1	Only side effect I have noticed is NOT DIEING of Covid .... 4 days of fever and muscle aches , zero energy , but full recovery , unlike 4 people I knew (unvaxed) that actually DID DIE of Covid ...
1	I feel confident and empowered knowing I'm protected against COVID-19 thanks to my vaccine.
1	But where is the vaccine? About 90 percent people still not vaccinated!!
1	Fwiw, if you got acute covid you'd probably be worse than how you're feeling with the vaccine.
1	You can't get through to absolute morons. If it doesn't fit their narrative, it's a lie and some big cover up operation.
0	About half my friends haven't had the vaccine and for some reason they seem to be less likely getting sick
1	Yes, they knew there was a ‚Äúmystery‚Äù type of pneumonia going through china (for at least a month) and started working on a vaccine when the genomic sequence was made public. This has been public knowledge for years
1	We need #Covaxin globally!
0	We are intelligent, brave women that fought against receiving the 'mandatory' Jab. They can't force this on us
0	I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt think they work or not, but I find it weird that me an my friend that have not been vaccinated have never had covid.
1	I've had 5 injections and NO side effects from any of them.
1	Yes, it is generally recommended that people get vaccinated in order to protect themselves and others from the virus.Vaccines have been shown to be highly effective at preventing COVID-19 and its complications, including hospitalization and death.
0	I never smoked, consumed a very clean, green diet and got plenty of fresh air exercise. In June, 6 weeks after my first Astra Zeneca jab I had a stroke!
1	We all win when we all do our part. Forget Trump and his Lemmings - DO IT - just DO IT.
0	I think it‚Äôs absolutely insane for them to mandate this poison clot shot for our entire military.
1	It‚Äôs the same for the COVID-19 vaccines. I trust the people who want to save not only their own lives (like the pilots of planes) but also the lives of their families, friends and several other billion people on spaceship Earth. Have there been bad reactions to the vaccines? Yes because some people can have allergic reactions. But in what proportion of the vaccinated population do such reactions occur? Have there been deaths right after people get vaccinated? Yes, but what did those people actually die from? Some people die right after they get out of bed; does that mean we should just stay in bed?
1	Definitely don't think a vaccine will kill u
1	Vaccine has saved lifes, how are you guys so ignorant??
0	Africans need no Western made vaccination for any man made virus.. Our Ancestors are Godly enough to provide us with nature's organic medicine. #FuckVaccination
1	Yes, when I am offered it in about March 2021 I will certainly take it
1	28."I'm not sure if I want to get the COVID vaccine because I don't know how it will affect my body long term."
1	I believe in vaccines and the running count with friends with covid is up to 3 so getting the vaccine is a no brainer
0	Not safe, not effective, and not tested.
1	The unvaccinated continue to put people with multiple sclerosis--like Neil Cavuto and me--and other immune-compromised people at risk. Please get Vaccinated. Unvaccinated people spread a higher viral load of COVID19.
1	Lol, all these republicans and anti-vax people in the comments championing their beliefs makes me glad that natural selection exists. More vaccines for the people who actually want to survive.
0	I would be willing to donate as many vaccines possible to any liberal that wants another one. how many boosters are we up to now? 72 boosters?
0	They also tell us the ‚Äòvaccines‚Äô are safe in pregnancy, breastfeeding and fertility That‚Äôs a lie, too‚Ä¶
1	I understand that some people have concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine, but for me, the benefits far outweigh any potential risks.
0	I'm glad my parents got it, and the following booster. But now it's just theatre. Im not a "vaccine denier", I just didn't get this one. I'm in my late 30's and am very healthy. I got COVID, it stunk for a week and everything is fine. I should have never been pressured to get the vaccine (I was), I should have never been told it wasn't just for me it's for others (it wasn't), and everyone I know who got all the shots ALL GOT COVID (many worse than I did).
1	I am an anaesthetist and am proud and extremely grateful that I have received 2 COVID19 Vaccinations and 1 Booster I have done this to protect My Family, Myself, My Patients, and those with whom I have contact.Do the right thing,
1	a Pfizer executive "allegedly" said they should mutate Covid to make more vaccines- hence more profit. Much to the dismay of anti-vaxxers the executive DID NOT say the Covid vaccine didn't work. Much to the dismay of anti-vaxxers the executive DID NOT SAY the vaccine was killing people and/or they are involved in depopulation. Honestly in my opinion this is the best "scandalous" thing a Pfizer executive can say. He is admitting the VACCINES WORK! Hence they need a different variant to make more money through a different vaccine.
0	Remember, this is the vaccine that we were forced to take or get fired, no exceptions.
0	I believe that the COVID-19 vaccine is just another way for the government to control us.
0	I'm here, and I will never get the jab!
1	One antivaxxer told me she didnt get the vaccine because of nano-technology. She was like "I dont know what nanotechnology is, so why would I get the vaccine?"
0	I love how the doctor tries to frame it as if the girl is just allowing her emotions to dictate her opinion and that science, mathematics and statistics are the only way to remain objective. That is completely true DR, but you fail to mention that mathematics and statistics are only has reliable as the numbers you use ,where they come from and who is giving them to you.
0	Unless the definition of rare has been changed to mean 'happens a LOT' then these side effects aren't rare
0	Isn't it funny how when it comes to debunking we only get to hear one side of the argument....and the other side gets instantly banned? Just because I don't want to take the vax ...
1	Resigned ourselves to the fact many people will die, but for business and the economy, feed the greed. I have Covid right now. Mt company wants me back at work. I want to go back to work. I work in a restaurant and my doctor told me if I go back I will infect my customers. I am staying home, I love my guests and want them safe. I never took off my mask, yes I have been wearing it for four years. I am vaccinated and boosted. I am diabetic and am taking paxlovid. We need to be safe and patient. We can only get through this together. Stand strong as a nation.
1	I'm proud to be pro the covid vaccine
0	The real question is how do we have smart phones and other technology but we haven't found a way to get cures for diseases without a needle
1	As a former paramedic I have to say that there's a difference between feeling really I'll and BEING really I'll be, when you're fighting for your life on a ventilator in ICU THEN you are really I'll. The vaccine SAVES LIVES end of!
1	Not going down the anti-vac road as vaccs are saving lives but the vacc doesn't prevent you from catching Covid or from getting the blood clots from the virus.
0	Covid vaccines are only effective at making profits and expanding government power.
0	Vaccinations resumed a few days later after an investigation.
0	9 pages of possible side effects  No thank you
0	#DrFRAUDci
0	No surprises here. Vaccines are a depopulation tool. Fauci wanted to put this shit in flu jabs but not enough people went for it so they changed the pathogen - Dr David Martin, M-CAM
1	The #CovidVaccine is a crucial tool in ending this pandemic and returning to the life we once knew. Let's get vaccinated
1	Modern Medicine is the Life saver.
0	I hear strength in Dr. John's tone today.   I am pleased to hear this back again.  I tell every mother I know - do not give your healthy babies a COVID vaccine.
1	at least a lot of people who would have been happy about this choked to death on a ventilator last year while their wife begged for money on facebook
1	I think hospitals won‚Äôt be overwhelmed if they refuse to treat unvaccinated people with COVID-19 (or at least prioritize treating those who have been vaccinated).
1	Should we get a second Omnicrom booster after 4 months from the last?
0	Never taking that shot of poision
1	Vaccines work better the more people have them. If everyone who can have it gets it, that makes the entire population safer.
0	Foolish for her to cave in.
0	Google and Twitter no longer restrict information about crimes involving vaccines and covid.
1	I wanted to spread a little hope with my success story of vaccine effectiveness! I tested negative for COVID!! And have had no symptoms whatsoever
1	First shot April '21, 2nd in June' 21 and 3rd in Dec. 21. Got covid from a close contact in early Jan. 22 and yes.. I'm positive. But almost zero symptoms. Friend who gave me covid only has 2 shots and has no worse symptoms than a bad cold. Thank you pfizer! Cigarettes taste a little funny, but if this is the worst of it.. BRAVO!
0	I will not take it period.
0	Our family didn‚Äôt get the shots. We‚Äôve all had Covid infection twice in 2022. They were like a mild cold for us adults, but amazingly short duration for my 12 yo. It lasted only 2 to 3 days for my kid.
1	The message is scary though, that so many are so hesitant to thake the vaccine. And if you have taken one dose, why leave out the second one, that completes the thing?
1	Most doctors wouldn't be brave enough to take the position that patients shouldn't be informed. I got my boosters - all of them. I'm not concerned about cancer risk, but I do like my Drs to not attack others who may just be doing their job - even if the Dr disagrees.
0	Covid was sent by democrats. And the vaccine isn't a cure. It causes strokes and heart attacks.
0	what most americans probrably don't know is that it requires years of scientific studies to determine safety of vaccines
1	Hoping the invention of the vaccine soon with GOD‚Äôd intervention . The world needs it urgently.
0	Who told you the VAX was safe? The same idiot who started PROJECT WARPSPEED ? We literally went from don‚Äôt trust the orange man, to hurry up and vax, don‚Äôt ask questions. UN real :/
1	Had covid twice, once before vaccines were available. I felt worse the day after a shot than I did when I actually had covid. It only lasts a day though so it's still absolutely worth it.
1	I feel so much safer and secure now that I've received the vaccine.
1	I got my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine just over a week ago and I'll be fully vaccinated by this coming weekend.I really really hope we can get enough people vaccinated by the summer so we can achieve a decent level of herd immunity and we don't have to worry about stupid new variants requiring new vaccines every few months!
1	We have to get the vaccine. I'm grateful to have received all the shots and boosters available to me at my age (which is up there), but please let's not blame all the distrust and madness on the lunatic fringe. Most of us hugely distrusted the pharmaceutical industry long before Covid...and we distrusted it with good reason.
1	Please get vaccinated so that our entire society can stay strong
1	Thank you so much for this vid I feel so much better I took my 1st dose today I‚Äôm 14 and social media says scary things about it and I‚Äôm really scared but after watching this I felt a little better
1	thank you for giving the importance of the vaccine
0	This man is the voice of millions who have lost their jobs and careers, their ability to put food in the table, lost friends and family and still stand strong in the belief that their body is theirs and does not belong to the government.
1	Don‚Äôt care which vaccine it is we just need to help stop the hospitalization and deaths
0	What a lie!
0	So now that he's out of the position being paid by big pharma, he's admitting little truths
1	Karen logic: we have years of research of professional scientists, but some random Facebook posts is the truth
0	See what happens when Phase IV testing is the general population?
0	It should be all, not just mRNA. All the COVID shots caused harm to many people. Let's stop focusing on the mRNA and start focusing on what is in all of them that caused so many to have health issues!? J injured here.
1	This morning was the first #vaccination date for the #baby . The poor man is very clingy now. I hope there is no fever. #ProVaccination #ProVaccination
1	It's almost as if the vaccination they discouraged saves lives?
0	Biggest lie in history
0	It is my opinion with all the people that are falling dead and he has to know and still get a 4th shot i can not feel sympathy or sorry for his stupidity the only thing he took someone else w/him!!! How many of you have ever read in the bible that in the end times people will be falling out of the sky???
0	Check out the video of the Pfizer exec  who talks about them doing targeted evolution of COVID in their labs in order to keep their vaccine relevant and how he thinks this was COVID‚Äôs origin in China. These people must be stopped.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
1	Vaccines are not perfect, but they're way ahead of whatever's in second place!
1	Ultimately I decided to pity the people in my life who held their ridiculous beliefs because of fear alone. I‚Äôm still not sure whether they deserve consideration. Some few of them came around to the idea of vaccination, though, but only after they watched several of their close family and friends die 30 years too young from CoViD-19.
1	It's imperative to never correlate a sudden death with the COVID-19 vaccine because we all know that it's 100% safe and effective. But what we can correlate is COVID-19 because we all know that this virus causes sudden death and heart problems. Ya'll better get vaccinated with saline or pharmaceutical invasive and irreversible medical concoction as it is the only way to protect yourself. Natural immunity just won't cut it.
1	My girlfriends‚Äô cousin has had some problems lately and ran into her while getting my meds and was like ‚ÄúA MAGNET STICKS TO WHERE I GOT THE VACCINE‚Äù repeatedly fails to show she is magnetic ‚Äúdo you see this!? explain.‚Äù
0	Do not take any vaccines they are all poison. Do not take any Flu vaccine. If you do not believe me go ahead and be like the others who died.
0	My least favorite conspiracy theory goes like this‚Ä¶ the Covid vaccine is safe and effective. Seriously. Enough. Duh
0	Actually here‚Äôs the truth‚Ä¶ @pfizer over there spreading #misinformation and maybe their CEO should be held criminally liable for those lies they keep spreading‚Ä¶ #VaxxInjuries #VAERS #VAXXkills #VAXXdeaths
0	I am #unvaccinated because I'm immune to not only Covid, but brainwashing, mind control, fear, bullying, threats and coercion too. I still think not getting the Covid vaccine is easily one of the best decisions I've made in life so far. And yes, I am proud of myself.
0	I'm very sorry for all who went and took these shots. I am in pure disbelief that people fell for it
0	My step mother‚Äôs uncle died three days after the second dose and he was healthy...
1	So the new thing in the antivaxx world is they‚Äôre afraid of vaccine shedding so they are encouraging others to wear a mask and keep six feet away from us vaccinated people ü§¶üèª‚ôÄÔ∏è
0	NOOOOO. VACCINES KILL
1	I'm taking the vaccine.
1	The evidence of your own eyes, an average intelligence. Talk to nurses in your average Covid ward , ask them who is being admitted, vaccinated or unvaccinated. Consult your state and country‚Äôs Bureau of statistics. I could tell you but you‚Äôd be more likely to believe it if you work it out yourself.
1	In British Columbia Canada, I received the Moderna Bivalent BA1 booster 2 weeks ago. No side effects. So far, no COVID infections, and I am very pleased with my vaccines so far.
0	The only sick people here on this earth are the ones saying those covid vaccines are safe. Im the only not vaccinated. Half of my friend group is death now and the others are sick. All of em are suffering from the same symptoms
1	I got my vaccine! I‚Äôm very glad to have it. I just wish everyone would learn more about it so they stop being afraid of it. Science is amazing and it will help us get back to normal quicker! As long as we all work together by getting vaccinated as soon as possible
1	We Came All This Way to Let #Vaccines Go Bad in the Freezer? https://t.co/Nk9U11mHPo #coronavirus
1	It‚Äôs very, very few. Less than one in a million. And most of those who have died after getting the vaccine were elderly people who already had serious health risks.
0	There are too many unknowns and potential side effects for me to feel comfortable getting the vaccine
1	Getting vaccinated helps preserve the health care system and its ability to serve everyone.
1	That‚Äôs my vaccine story. Super boring. My long nightmare is winding down. If you have the opportunity to get the (well tested) vaccine, you get the vaccine regardless of the brand.
1	Well I don‚Äôt see Herman Cain or Diamond bragging about being antivax lately either.
0	Many medical employees are suing the big hospitals and pharma's for trying to make them take the shot or stay home without pay!! I say screw that and I'll stay home until case is won!!
1	I can‚Äôt imagine all of the pain and sickness these kids are going to go through because of their parents paranoia. Its insane that these people dont want it simply because the government wants them to get it.
1	They're not going to kill you.
0	I'm 3 times unvaccinated and eagerly awaiting my 4th un -vaccination. What exactly does a shot that alters your DNA and has people dropping dead all over the world have to do with helping your lungs?
0	It‚Äôs been years of mocking, name calling, discrimination and wishing harm on the unvaccinated.. They harvest so much hate for the people that have done nothing to them.
0	As long as these remain ‚Äútheories‚Äù I will continue to decline the jab.
1	This be Safe and Hygienic Vaccine. No problem coming
1	I'm sick of the rants about the COVID vaccine causing myocarditis. The COVID virus itself causes myocarditis 100 times more often than the vaccine itself. Literally!
0	The longer I go without getting the Jab, the more confident I become that it was the correct decision.
1	We did it with SARS. We did it with Ebola. We can do it with #COVID19.
0	This is all ONE BIG EXPERIMENT ON US!!!
1	Got Moderna on Monday. I feel the best I ever had!
0	Call me simpleminded, but when I learned that most people are over 99% immune to this coronavirus, like other coronaviruses, I figured nothing else was needed besides my immune system.
1	My 28yo brother got myocarditis from the shot‚Ä¶
1	the vaccine is just like birth control it‚Äôs not 100% and it doesn‚Äôt stop you from getting covid it‚Äôs to help prevent the covid experience, I feel perfectly fine tbh and that‚Äôs bc of the vaccine
0	An investigation is needed because the information is now hitting the main stream, that's it.
0	Can you believe it?  People think vaccines work!  Next they'll think it is possible to land a booster rocket on a barge upright in the Atlantic in the middle of the night?  Geez!

0	A friend of mine had a stroke, just 2 weeks after his second covid vaccine ...! Coincidence? I doubt it!
0	The biggest lie was that the vaccine was safe and effective.
1	I definitely plan on getting the vaccine. I honestly feel like it is my patriotic duty to do so.
1	They are safe
0	CROOKS AND LIARS.
1	Vaccines are our protective vests against diseases.
0	The facts tell a very different story
0	Connect the dots people. 2+2=4. If the VAXXED are catching more flu and catching more CLOTS, wouldn't it be good to stay away from the VAXX.
0	Our family didn‚Äôt get the shots.   We‚Äôve all had Covid infection twice in 2022. They were like a mild cold for us adults, but amazingly short duration for my 12 yo. It lasted only 2 to 3 days for my kid.   We‚Äôre so glad we didn‚Äôt fall for the hysteria.
0	How do I know if COVID vaccine is safe? I dont know It will be fully tested in 2 years from now.  See ya LAB RATS
1	Not just Covid vaccines, but vaccines for influenza, cholera, hepatitis, whooping cough, measles, polio, shingles, pneumonia, etc etc!! We are truly grateful for our amazing scientists! And for the mugs who will ‚Äòlaugh‚Äô at this comment ‚Ä¶ think about this ... YOU are only free of these dreadful diseases because the MAJORITY of US understand the science and ARE vaccinated! You lot hang onto our coattails!! You‚Äôre welcome!
1	Vaccination is the best way to create the right conditions for herd immunity to develop
1	I work in an Emergency Room full of covid positive patients at all times. I‚Äôm fully vaxxed and I wear my mask and still haven‚Äôt caught covid! Thankful for vaccines and trusting medical professionals not radical right wing propagandists
1	I wanted the Pfizer vaccine, it was my first choice and I‚Äôm so glad I was able to get it. I get my second shot in a few weeks.
0	STUPID! COVID VACCINES? NEVER AGAIN!!!
0	You will never know any exact long term side effects during the first two-year trials.
0	No. The risk/benefit analysis in the beginning did not warrant me getting the vaccine. At that point, potential vaccine events were speculated only. Now, they are known to be extremely high. Thus, I am LESS inclined to take the vaccine now than in the beginning.
0	I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit that I never took the COVID vaccine and I never will.
0	I'm unvaxxed and have never had covid while being tested weekly.
1	Had he said "there are side effects to the vaccine" I would not have disagreed, although Imo, they are completly overshadowed by the advantages of the vaccine, but he had to spout some bullshit conspiracy theory in there making him look like a fool.
0	mRNA vaccines killed 6000 US citizens since December 2020. That is some serious adverse effects so think once more
1	Vaccines reduce the likelihood of infection. Then they also reduce the likelihood of spreading it if infected.
0	I get to choose what I put in MY body. Fully support this doctor. I never listen to the media or the government. Always using spin. WELL DONE THAT DOCTOR!!
0	Thank you Dr. C! These numbers are much better than I would anticipate. I wish I thought more patients had reported their problems.
1	Vaccination is the way to a brighter tomorrow. Get your shot today and help us all move forward. #BrightTomorrow
0	The point is that the vaccine should have strengthened the immune system to be able to fight off the virus without needing to be hospitalized. The 35 health workers who got infected and needed to be hospitalized is worrying news. So far, no other vaccine has reports of those vaccinated and got COVID19  that needed to be hospitalized.
0	Many people with immunological thrombocytopenia are currently debating getting the covid vaccine.
1	I don't think the vaccine is the solution to everything, but it's definitely better than nothing.
0	I have natural immunity and have never had a flu shot... feeling fine at 60 years old...my body choice
1	I believe that vaccines have saved countless lives throughout history.
0	After reading the pfizer documents I can confidently recommend that you don‚Äôt ever take another jab.
0	Everyone who took the vaxx has failed the test. These people are so uninformed and unintelligent that they are a danger to a proper social configuration. They believed obvious lies. They violated their own informed consent and demand that other‚Äôs informed consent was violated. They thought lockdowns were justified. They were wrong the entire time, and they are still in power. I spit in the face of every LowIQ vaxxtard. Losers. Total losers.
0	This video has helped me a lot. I‚Äôm definitely not putting something in my body that will affect my natural immunity. How can anything compare to what the Most High has put inside you naturally.
0	The Pfizer shot is listed with 1291 side effects. That's insane!
0	Perhaps we should leave those who do not want the vaccination alone. If we did, we would see this country getting better as each month passes.
0	I wish you could know my Amish neighbors who have no worries about covid and none have gotten sick either. Placebo? Whatever it is they don‚Äôt need vaccinated for Covid-19. Probably helps that they don‚Äôt have tv or social media shit in their lives too! That said. People who have been vaccinated against covid are still getting covid so why is it relevant? It‚Äôs still experimental at best.
1	Natural immunity to Covid? I wouldn't count on it. I wouldn't want to depend on that. Even though I had covid I took the jab anyway. Safety folx.
1	Vaccination has allowed me to protect not only myself, but also those who are more vulnerable to severe illness.
1	I got Covid very early in the pandemic - mid Jan 2020. I was very nearly hospitalized. It would take too long to tell you WHY, but I am EXTREMELY resistant to hospitalization and I was ready to call for the ambulance MYSELF. Thought I had mycoplasma pneumonia plus flu plus strep plus I had no idea what.  Since then I have had the initial vaccines and every booster I am allowed (over 60 disabled so that's all of them), plus the bivalent recently.  I get phantom smells, and can't smell some things at all. Things don't taste the same as they did before. Compared to some (like those folks who smell rotting meat or worse ALL THE TIME, or nothing at all) my odor detection anomalies and taste changes aren't a big deal - but recently it changed AGAIN, and I now realize, could change yet again. I just hope it doesn't get as bad as for some people, who can't eat for gagging from the phantom odors.  I may have had long COVID for over a year but its hard to tell - it could be that it just took me so long to recover because I ALSO had undiagnosed Addison's disease. I've had the brain fog and the fatigue for decades anyway (from undiagnosed Addison's) but it was a lot worse after COVID.  Regardless I DO NOT WANT IT AGAIN. A high school friend of my son's DIED of COVID after over 6 months in a coma in 2021. A young healthy adult, unvaccinated, died, putting his family through hell hoping he'd recover all that time, not to mention the horrendous hospital bills in the aftermath.  I am not fooling around with this. Over 1 million dead. Hundreds of thousands with long COVID. Even a mild case can leave you with long COVID. I mask, and I get every single vaccine that I am allowed. I would like to continue to get boosters every 6 months. I don't know if that's allowed, but it ought to be. That's when they wear off.
1	Vaccines provide immunity before one is exposed to life-threatening disease.
1	There have been numerous claims like that going around since the Covid-19 vaccines were released.
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
1	Team Moderna here! Got my 2nd shot on Friday! So far, so good!!!
0	Even if this is true and there is no chance of DNA damage I still believe a more natural way of improving our immune systems is the right way
0	Ya. We are done with this circus. No more shots.
1	Do you think calling virus democrat and vaccine Republican does the trick to get them vaccinated?
0	Proud to be an unvaccinated conspiracy theorist.
0	No vaccine needed because I trust GOD.
0	This is why we're seeing lots of articles claiming unvaccinated dying from Covid. So they can claim, mandated vaccines are for the greater good. And they're ignoring all the deaths, eg the 5% reported to MHRA and OpenVaers. Prepare accordingly.
1	Still waiting for approval of moderna for 6-11 year olds üòñ
1	Important as the elderly are such a priority group to receive COVID-19 vaccines, including the boosters
1	This definitely makes me feel better about my side effects after getting the vaccine. Cause wow I've been tired.
0	well i didn‚Äôt give it to my kids thanks god. but boy do i regret taking it now. not to mention my wife was forced to at the time as she is a nurse in NY.
1	I've had the vaccine and 2 boosters  haven't got COVID that I know of and still kicking.
1	Vaccines are your best defense to prevent severe Covid. Get your bivalent!
0	My girlfriend hasn't stopped coughing getting sore throat and fever since the second one ..must be a coincidence
1	I have had 4 covid vaccines all Pfizer. I'm 63 and I do not have full blown vaccine induced immune suppresed Aids! I do have a very bad toothache which I do not think was induced by the Vaccine lol How can someone with no scientific proof of what they are saying stand in front of people and tell stories! Yes they should be accountable for what they say ESPECIALLY when they have no proff to back up their claim. Keep up the good work! Mark from Montreal Canada.
0	The vaccine has horrible side effects
0	Effects after one Pfizer vaccine were alarming enough that I never got the second or any boosters. My only regret is I got the vaccine at all, but what trigger that decision was knowing two people who died from COVID without any preexisting conditions or risk factors
0	This video definitely helped me because I heard someone talking about a conspiracy theory with the covid vaccine and I started to get paranoid but now I see that they are just crazy
1	we want to be done with this goddamned pandemic and that requires people to be vaccinated so that other people in your community and country can be free to go about their business without worrying about their immunocompromised friends and relatives
1	With all these idiots who refuse to embrace the truth and attribute deaths to vaccines rather than COVID, it's working. Vaccinations were practically never dangerous.
0	Love how you defend Pfizer. Don't want to miss out on those Pfizer fire side chats where you can't ask questions.
1	Why are vaccines important? Vaccines have an extensive reach: they protect individuals, communities, and entire populations (the eradication of smallpox is an example).
0	Canada had more excess deaths in vaccine-coerced 2021 than in 2020 when citizens were "unprotected."
0	If you can't be properly informed they have something to hide, it's as simple as that.
0	WHO are not to be trusted. Do not take their vac it could cost you your life
1	I got my latest booster in December; My granddau who was visiting me got covid in January, but I continued to test negative. Thank you, vaccine!
0	You need a vaccine for something that you have a 1% chance of getting? And a 99% chance of full recovery? No way
0	Ugh I've heard too many stories of people experiencing side effects from the covid vaccine
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle
1	Ban coats. People still freeze to death when wearing coats. Coats don't work.
1	I feel like so many of yall dont actually know how vaccine works, pfizer team here! <3
0	I started on the base line of all previous vaccines had taken 7/10 years to be safely delivered, then read articles on traditional vaccines, MRNA, then watched lectures and pod casts by different doctors, scientists, then I decided who I considered to be valid and who was politicising science and for what purpose and what was to gain. Or in other words I used common scense.
0	Fauci committed crimes. If we stop talking about them, Fauci will never be held accountable.
1	I can't wait to get my next booster!!
0	Pfizer wanted to hide their trial data for 75 years but they lost their case and were told to release it, they have immunity so they don't take any responsibility for their doggy shots. The shot give you blood clots and heart information, people are literally dying from this and you still pushing the s***t on people. You are well and truly criminal organisation!
1	I'm truly embarrassed for this country, the amount of anti vaxxers makes me ashamed of this country
1	I am in my seventies all my friends and family have had the astra venaca with no problems or side effects at all, we would still have polio, smallpox, and Tb killing thousands if we did not take vaccines to stop it.
0	I am 68 years old,  not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy.  In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a  so happy we did.
1	The #measles vaccine helps prevent other dangerous disease for children, like pneumonia and diarrhea
0	It‚Äôs bullshit. Don‚Äôt let them get to your head.
0	Im proud to be unvaccinated
1	Vaccines are the hope we need in this pandemic.
0	The world largest Covid Vaccin Experiment. Ask for the package insert.
1	I had covid in the early days. Very mild. My husband had the worst case but recovered. We are both doubly vaccinated. Just do it.
1	He's anti-vax, so he can go suck a butthole.
1	Vaccine mandates have a track record of effectively decreasing communicable disease spread and health implications.
1	Got my jab. For the curious, it was Felt secure, will travel safely.
0	As a healthcare worker + nursing student, this last year I couldn't pursue my education or work without being forced the vaccine. I went unvaccinated for two years and took the lesser of three evils, Novavax. Thank you for representing us all Massie!
1	It‚Äôs the right thing to do to protect yourself and help protect people who can‚Äôt get the vaccine themselves.
0	There is no vaccine, it is an "experimental gene modification injection" that requires constant booster shots to remain effective. The shot is nothing more than a therapeutic which reduces the impact of the Covid-19 virus.
1	Vaccination is taking place in schools, kindergartens, health centres & communities in the following districts: Chiredzi, Gutu, Bikita & Mwenezi in Masvingo province Chikomba & Goromonzi in Mashonaland East Chipinge in Manicaland province Mazowe in Mash Central Province
1	Dummies, vaccines have been used for centuries and have a long history of making is safer!
1	I know one of my covid skeptic friends got convinced that covid is real after his close friend died from covid. This may be what people need to see.
1	I am an ER doc in East Texas. received my vaccine last Thursday. I really appreciate the scientists who developed it. I can‚Äôt thank you enough.
1	Vaccines are especially important for people at increased risk, such as people with chronic lung diseases and those who are immunocompromised.
0	Frankenstein Science.
0	All the people who defended the vaccine are awfully quiet these days
0	well luckily I made it to my early 30s before the covid era and got to experience some normal existence. From here on out, good luck to everyone!!
0	imagine not being covid vaccinated working throughout the entire pandemic to this date with covid patients and NEVER contracting covid its a reality.
1	"Look at me! I'm defying the government! I'm a free-thinker and everyone else is stupid except me! I'm a non-conformist, everyone should be more like me and not those loony leftists!" No real argument, just mudslinging. Sounds about right.
0	Still testing the public‚Äôs reaction, ready for the next hoax they have lined up_Climate change lock downs‚Ä¶be ready my fellow humans.
1	I will as soon as I can because I‚Äôve had asthma and COPD since I was about 12 and a heart attack a few years ago.
0	Do the #vaccinated have a leg to stand on? (excluding those on their clot amputation journey) https://t.co/D2v3wealSZ
0	This guy is much more than a Tennis legend. He is a legend to the world for standing up for what‚Äôs right. God bless
1	I was 70 when the vaccine was up for apt. I couldn‚Äôt get it fast enough for my wife and I, second shot feb14. We started voluntarily wearing masks first week of previous March. It was a long wait for the shot. I had such anxiety going grocery shopping at Costco and Walmart.
1	That moment when science and technology saved us all !
1	Myocarditis and pericarditis are both extremely rare side effects but it is not unusual to see. The smallpox vaccine had a much higher occurrence of both side effects post vaccine that are attributed to the vaccine itself and I believe the anthrax vaccine also has that as a documented side effect. It is not common and all the antivaxxers are making it seem like it is a run of the mill side effect like arm soreness.
1	Vaccinations are the most effective method of primary prevention we have. Want to solve vaccine hesitancy, let‚Äôs incorporate this science into school health programs. Sadly, this would be categorized as political, when in reality it‚Äôs information that is just as important as preventing STD‚Äôs and pregnancy.
1	Our theoretical framework reproduces the recent explosive growth in pro-vaccination views, and predicts that these views will dominate in a decade.
0	A lot of y‚Äôall are just mad bc the #vaccinated label you thought would mean you‚Äôre a better person really just means you‚Äôre gullible and lazy.
1	I am a consultant in Infectious Disease. My wife and I have had all 3 doses of the vaccine: they are effective, safe, and protect against severe illness/death. Our kids are under 5 yrs but if they were older I‚Äôd be getting them vaccinated too.  Please Get Vaccinated Now
0	Pretty funny how people take shorts from our broken government. Covid should have been renamed to population control drug. What a joke
1	Virus has much harder time spreading in a vaccinated population
0	I‚Äôm not interested in being part of the largest medical experiment ever conducted on human beings, at least as regards the two mRNA-style vaccines. Not a soul on the earth knows the long-term effects of ‚Äútricking‚Äù the body‚Äôs amino acid production mechanism into producing something it would otherwise not produce until it faced the virus itself; no one knows how long this ‚Äúprotection‚Äù will last or whether you‚Äôll be taking these shots every six months for the rest of your natural life; no one knows how many people will die from the shot who would otherwise have dealt with the virus just fine.
1	I had a sore arm but I get that from my yearly flu shot anyway.
0	But Christian world will deny to take this vaccinations because there is something wrong. Don't force it otherwise there will be civil war. Amen
0	Everyone will get Covid sooner or later. The gene therapy does not prevent it.
0	Still poisoning the masses? #clotshot #DiedSuddendly
0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
0	I got bell's palsy after my Pfizer shot. Never again for me.
1	I'm thoroughly baffled and confused about why death rates are higher among the people who think wearing a mask will suffocate you, vaccinations will microchip and/or kill you, and the proper treatment of COVID is livestock dewormer and antimalarial drugs. A mystery for the ages. Scholars may never unravel this enigma.
0	Bogus 19 wont hurt you but the needles will
0	The best part of being a conspiracy theorist is not having myocarditis.
0	You will all end up dying suddenly. Look what happen to this guy, had jab 2021 now dead 2022
0	Proposed solution for family members who "require" you get the jab. Just tell them that you got it. They seem to believe everything they're told anyway.
1	Many of us are highly vunerable and wear a mask it‚Äôs not to be laughed at COVID is as bad as ever get vaccinated and please wear a mask #WearAMask #MasksInHealthcare
1	Yes the AntiVax are all over this like a rash. Despite the fact that the CDC following up on the red flag in this database shows us  that they actually investigate any worrisome data, and don‚Äôt hide it at all, completely contrary to the AntiVax rhetoric.
0	Don't vaccinate your children with the regular old shots until you read about the negative health effects
1	I have often wondered if COVID left the affected with physical deformities. How many would still deny vaccination?
0	pfizer investigating its self.....like the fox investigating the hen house for an egg count
1	At 2:22 this morning my beautiful niece gained her Angel wings. She passed away from long Covid . She was not vaccinated because she thought it was a conspiracy theory. She left 3 kids behind. Please get vaccinated !!!
1	I'll get any vaccine as long as I can study the benefit vs the risk, and I can make up my own fucking mind about it.
0	Why would I get a so called vaccine that doesn't stop you from getting Covid or spreading it.
1	I have gotten the Moderna vaccine when it become available to me in my country. I do not want to die because of covid. In my countries , many died due to chronic illness that they already had. Actually I can choose to get either Pfizer or Moderna vaccine but I chose to get Moderna vaccine because of the earlier appointment date. The side effects after the first jab were really mild. Just a sore arm and tiredness. The second jab makes me want to die. It's like a bad case of flu with headache, fever, tiredness and sore arms. I can imagine if I got the real covid 19 infection, it will be multitude time worse.
0	I now have blood cancer. Thanks Pfizer
0	I've never seen so much lying and deception surrounding any one particular topic before this one, in my entire life.
1	I'm fully vaxxed and boosted, and I've never had any issues. Also, too... I've never had COVID. #vaccinated #VaccinesWork #GetVaccinated
1	I am already vaccinated
1	I remember the scary articles all over the place in January 2020. The world had known about it for about two months by then. Does this person think the disease just randomly popped up in June or some shit?
1	Vaccination is a simple and effective way to protect ourselves and our communities. Don't wait, get your shot. #ProtectYourself
1	Scientists say that 3.1 million lives have been saved in the US alone by covid vaccines
1	So great nice people to accept vaccine
1	I took Covishield (AstraZeneca) Vaccine yesterday ü§ûüèº Developed mild fever, bad headache, body aches. Feel slightly better now, as symptoms are reducing. Took acetaminophen for symptomatic relief. Stay Safe people üñêüèº
1	Get vaccinated and get back to enjoying life!
0	I'm unvaxxed in Aus and all my unvaxxed family and friends are doing fine. Most of my vaxxed contacts range from health issues all the way up to "up shit creek without a paddle".
1	We fast tracked these vaccines and boosters. In doing so how many tens of thousands of lives were saved. A friend and her husband tested positive for Covid in December and January of 2020 before there was access to vaccines. My husband and I just got it for the first time a few weeks ago. It ruined our holidays but we are around to talk about it. Neither my friend or her husband were that lucky.
0	My neighbor died from a massive heart attack the day after she got the vaccine. She was a healthy and active 58 year old woman with no prior heart condition.
0	So glad I didn't get vaccinated! How many of you are still good?
1	There is NO proof that the vaccine is not 100% safe and effective. There is no proof that it messes with women‚Äôs cycles or reproductive health! Misinformation!
1	I think the jab is ok.
0	17."I think the COVID vaccine is safe and effective. I've done my research and I'm confident in its ability to protect me."
0	No need for a covid vaccine. Social distancing and wearing a mask work just as well
1	Please, go get the shot. You absolutely are doing the right thing!
0	Please keep all of your records. Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt know the harm they could cause‚Äù. We knew - they knew.
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
1	I support this cartoon, and the message it spreads. Vaccinations are amazing.
0	Not a question.  It's no different to STDs. If there is a risk, leave it be.
0	I was 49 (UK male) when COVID hit and I felt under so much pressure from everyone to get the jabs, including my then 43 year old female partner. My health is not good. I just could not force myself to do it as I thought it was rushed out and so many drug giants were involved and they are all money driven. I tried my best to avoid getting COVID, but I did get it in the end. I was quite ill for a week, but not hospitalised. My partner had it at the same time, but she had 2 jabs and was nearly as ill as I was.   have had some issues since then with random pain around the heart muscle and shortness of breath for many months, but I am not convinced that this was COVID. I am still unvaccinated.
0	Pure bloods ftw
1	Only willful ignorance prevents vaccination.
1	Vaxed, boosted wear a mask,  didn't get Covid. I know Four people that didn't get vaxed. They got Covid twice and two had long term Covid. Get medical advice from a MD not yahoo comments.
1	We must tell the authorities of any unvaccinated people so we can get back to normal.
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
1	Second Dose of   complete!  Thank you again to all Frontline Workers,  &amp; eve
1	I will continue to get covid vaccines for the rest of my life if I have to. #VaccinesWork
1	I took the vaccine, and then BAM! Three weeks later I had terrible swamp ass. The Hollyweird elites want you to think it's from the jalape√±o popper eating contest that morning, but I think we know that's just a bit too convenient.
1	I suggest if you are not fully vaccinated against Covid (by choice) and you come down with the virus, you are not allowed into any hospital for treatment.
0	There are no credible data to prove the long-term safety and efficacy of this vaccine. At this stage, it‚Äôs still experimental, even if all regulatory approvals are in place.
1	You think it's ok to claim people died when they didn't? To claim people died from the vaccine when they died of Covid?
0	This story aired in May of 2021! How many young men were vaccinated after this date? This story didn't get traction in May 2021. 18 cases!!! No follow up from officials. Instead, shot was still pushed. @MartyMakary @NBSaphierMD @AlexBerenson @Karol
1	feel lucky to have access to the COVID-19 vaccine and to be doing my part in ending this pandemic.
0	I‚Äôm anti vax
1	I assume you would go to hospital if you break an arm, a leg or have a significant injury. You would also trust doctors with surgery - which, to be honest, is a way higher level of trust than getting advice on a drug or another. During surgery, they cut you open. One slightly wrong move and you‚Äôre gone. That‚Äôs intense. And yet¬†you don‚Äô trust the same people, and the same science, in regards with a simple jab that is given to everyone else.
1	Great example and initiative - Minister of Health of Armenia got publicly vaccinated against HPV #provaccination #vaccineswork
1	fr, Vox explained this so well! it's easily understandable even to a teen like me, so everyone needs to see this. hopefully people will choose to get vaccinated instead of refusing them. coming from a family where my parents, relatives, and even grandparent are doctors, working during this pandemic is exhausting and it can't go on forever. i hope people realise that any step of prevention is important compared to no prevention at all.
0	With all we know now i would be scared to know i got the shot and knowing what might be coming for me!!!
0	"All of us connect to each other". Is that via the Bluetooth tech in the injectable cocktails?
1	I don't know anyone with vaccine issues
0	Official #government #data from #Germany suggests #covid fully #vaccinated people will #develop #AIDS  https://t.co/clcisJPjpx https://t.co/ZU2b8X5uCB
1	For those who are still confused by why it‚Äôs safer to get vaccinated against Covid-19 for young males aged 18 to 30, even though there‚Äôs a slightly higher  risk of myocarditis after vaccination for that group. Myocarditis is far more common as a result of Covid-19 disease, than as a result of vaccination. There are far more risks from Covid-19 disease than just myocarditis. Myocarditis from vaccination is much easier to treat and less dangerous than from disease. The risk of myocarditis from vaccination is between 1 and 10 per 100,000 dependent on age/sex. The risk of myocarditis as a result of Covid-19 disease is 146 in 100,000. These figures are for Pfizer vaccine. Given the choice it might be sensible for young adult males to get Pfizer rather than Moderna as the risk from Moderna vaccine is slightly higher in that age group, but if they don‚Äôt have a choice between vaccines, it‚Äôs still a better balance of risk to get vaccinated with Moderna, than not to be vaccinated at all.
1	It's an absolute marvel of human achievement that we were able to get multiple vaccines out within a year or so. These vaccines will save millions of lives around the world and get us out of this pandemic
0	They dont have a large enough sample size, to conclude "no side effects" people are dying every day from it, but it gets dismissed as unrelated or unknown.
1	Be grateful to the UNICEF..for all their efforts.....
1	Antivaxx is appealing because it makes people feel like they have learned a secret conspiracy about money, power & control being run by Big Pharma when the opposite is true!
1	What good does it do to argue with an Anti Vaxxer? The ONLY benefit that I can see,is that they only become more dug into their belief into NOT getting the vax. l have read thousands of anti vaxxer comments, & have yet to see a pro vaccine tweep convert an anti vaxxer.
1	I am fully vaccinated. Am old as dirt. Not dead. I feel like I should make a Granny Weatherwax inspired sign to make sure these people do not come for me with their shovels
1	Hopeful that folks can remove the politics from this debate and just vaccinate and mask our kids at school.
1	Bots participating in the pro-vaccination network exhibit the same behavior as bots disseminating health misinformation.
1	Yup, rather get the shot than the virus, kinda lesser of the two evils.
1	We have a roommate, a 19 year old yogi girl who has been anti vaccine from the start to the point where she'll regularly share Sherri Tenpenny videos with her friend. She has prattled off about "my body my choice" the entire time. And she just tested positive for covid.  The minute she tested positive, it stopped being just about her body and her choice. I had to make several phone calls to my boss to figure out whether or not to come into work (at a children's hospital). My fianc√© had to reschedule her work week so that she could work from home. All three of us teach at a gym, and we had to reschedule meetings, find substitutes for classes, or cancel our classes, all because of her body and her god damn choice.  I've had to call my parents and ask them to get tested since I saw them a few days before she was showing symptoms. And to make it all worse, I have to miss work this week which will eat up the PTO I was saving for a vacation. All because of her body, and her fucking choice.  Fuck the anti vaxx crowd, fuck Sherri Tenpenny, and fuck anyone pedaling the absolute horseshit conspiracies.
1	Two things never get old, dark humor and unvaccinated kids....
1	Vaccine Science is very well known. We know it works, and works very well.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	They're not mentioning the biggest side effect...it doesn't work. 98% recovery anyway
0	A blood clotting disorder was one of the side effects I had after receiving the vaccine
0	5 reasons... 1) it is still experimental, 2) adverse reactions, 3) unkown long term effects, 4) no liability protection, 5) pharma criminal histories.
1	‚ÄúAcross the country?‚Äù It‚Äôs a global pandemic ü§® But yes I am hoping I can get this as soon as possible!
0	This is not possible because the virus has mutated into different strains.
1	Just to clarify. At diagnosis, infected unvaccinated and vaccinated people have a similar viral load. However, the vaccinated people have fewer symptoms, so are less likely to pass it on. Also, over the next few days, the viral load in vaccinated people drops much more rapidly.
0	How can you trust something that has been tested for such a shoer time?
1	Oh get a life, vaccines work and we‚Äôre better for it
0	The vaccines caused blood clots
0	2of my sons friends are awaiting heart transplants, prev healthy cross fit trainers. Another died yesterday 12hrs post jab. 40yr healthy man.3,13,15,17yr olds don‚Äôt die from sudden cardiac death,unless jabbed. See it daily. Heinous
0	In June, 6 weeks after my first Astra Zeneca jab I had a stroke.
0	Vaccine is not so SURE for THE PEOPLE to heal...but business is very SURE ...stay safe
1	Lets not forget, #COVID19 is a bigger risk to our elderly and those with underlying health conditions like TB, HIV, and hypertension. Let's all do our part to keep them safe by getting the COVID-19 vaccine. #StaySafe
0	But we are getting news such as that the person who had his two doses of vaccine and died of covid...how is it possible?  What u r saying is true
0	If the COVID vaccine works, then why the fuck would The Biden administration extend the Covid-19 public health emergency until April??
1	I‚Äôve just had my 6th covid shot, and a once in a lifetime pneumonia shot, and my annual flu shot. All of them because I don‚Äôt want to die, and any one of those illnesses could easily kill me.
1	You just convinced me to not be picky about vaccines. Thank You!
1	Vaccination is great and should be highly encouraged.
0	Because it was being forced. How hard the govt was pushing it made me suspicious enough to investigate, once I did that, no way.
0	I have had COVID twice both times my body took care of the virus, my body took care of it better the second time . So why should I get vaccinated
0	True ..agree keep awsy from any brand of Vicc ..put your trust in God
0	Obviously the FDA is just going to ignore the deaths and side effects because they‚Äôre captured by Pfizer   #CovidVaccines #CovidVaccine #covid19vaccine
1	Scientists say that 3.1 million lives have been saved in the US alone by covid vaccines
0	Imagine a product so awful that you have to lobby for tyrannical laws just so ppl will buy it.
0	My friends never took the first vaccine
0	#EricAdams lifted #covidVaccine #Mandate today. The reason he gave was because 96% of city workers &amp; 80% of new yorkers are #vaccinated. The real reasons should have been: #covidshot doesn't stop #transmission &amp; the mandate is #unlawful !! He should reinstate all fired workers ! https://t.co/rQMzxBBolt
0	it's called a fake vaccine with poison that's killing sooooooo many!
1	Vaccination is the key to opening up schools and providing a safe learning environment.
0	How about NOT getting vaxxed and living normally. That way you don‚Äôt have a chance of seizures, blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks
0	Dangerous and Deadly
0	Let me know when im going to die from not taking it‚Ä¶ never had covid/ no shots
1	Cant wait to see the karens on this one
1	People proudly drinking piss instead of getting a vaccine. What a wonderful world.
0	The government doesn't get to say what goes into your veins
0	I know! My beautiful nephew decided to get the vaccine, then suddenly he came out as gay. Of course me, my sister, and my brother in law took the liberty of cutting contact with him.
0	Never had any flu shot, never will.
1	I feel this. I am about to go work in a shift where the conspiracy theories about the vaccine are mind blowing. Each shift I feel like I lose more faith in humanity.
0	Bill Gates admits that the current COVID vax is garbage
1	Why does all this vaccination conspiracy talk get looked at as more legit than Qanon? It is basically the same crap! Someone says something due to "insider" info & people want to believe it. No proof- just talk!
0	I feel sad for the little kids that had to get this shot.
0	spike protein is harmless" yeah dude not like it disrupts the blood brain barrier
0	Doctor confirms "50% increase" in miscarriages and a "50% decrease" in overall fertility since the Covid vaccine rollout. The vaccines were about depopulation
1	Plenty of women seem to be getting pregnant after being fully vaccinated. I have multiple friends who are expecting right now.
0	If the vaccine is so great, then why is the vaccinated so worried about the unvaccinated?
0	The next person who asks me if I have had the vaccine yet, I will be replying with, "Have you had your colonoscopy yet?", "Have you had your pelvic exam yet ?"
0	how dare these people to decide on their own to take something in their bodies.
1	My spouse and I have already gotten both shots of the Pfizer vaccine as of the first of March. We are now both fully vaccinated. We had no side effects except for a bit of soreness in the arm each time. I was very happy to get the vaccine, and will continue to do so if booster shots are needed in the future
1	"You're downplaying the risks of vaccines." As opposed to downplaying the risks of measles, polio, smallpox, etc?
0	Unfortunately, same thing happened to my brother :( he got sick after the second jab and after 3 months he was hospitalized and found out he had stage 4 cancer. To be fair, i think vaccines work differently with everyone and we should always check with our doctor before getting vaccinated. Some people just have existing conditions that will not be favorable in case they get vaccinated. My Prayers and thoughts üôè
1	It is recommended to get vaccinated.
0	The Covid Vaccine is killing people
0	Strange how they get vaccination status of people but not when it comes to the sudden deaths
0	I aint taking that poison noppeeeeee
1	thank god for this vaccine
1	To those saying God will protect you from the virus, you are absolutely correct, that‚Äôs why God has blessed so many good Doctors & Health professionals with knowledge to provide us with a vaccine
1	I couldn‚Äôt imagine why. After all, I‚Äôm¬†so sure¬†you‚Äôre smarter and better informed than the CDC and the rest of the world medical community. I‚Äôm sure you also believe that the world is flat and the moon is made of green cheese, and I can‚Äôt imagine any reason to disabuse you of those notions, either.
0	The risk of vaccine enhanced disease aka Paradoxical Immune Enhancement or pathogenic priming is far too great. Its the very reason the first SARS vaccine wasn't released to the public. The chances of surviving are far to great with no vaccine than to risk one.
1	i‚Äôm petrified of injections and for mine day before yesterday! feeling great absolute girlboss moment!
1	The American people thank you and all of the doctors and scientists who developed and tested these vaccinations, as well as the politicians who supported them and the pharmacists and nurses who administered them, a great debt of gratitude! GetVaccinated.
1	Vaccines have saved countless lives throughout history, and the #CovidVaccine is no exception
1	I pity the stupid anti-vaxxers and conspiracists shouting at me. As they were getting kicked out of Glenelg, some of the anti-vaxxers shouted at me. Well, I‚Äôm used to that.
0	Vaccination all day every day is the standard of practice, and due to blanket amnesty to vaccination related liability if you take the advice and suffer damages they are not culpable.
0	I've never seen so much lying and deception surrounding any one particular topic before this one, in my entire life.
1	COVID-19 vaccines can help prevent you from dying if you do get infected with COVID-19.
0	Undisputed Facts:  - mRNA is not a vaccine. Changing the definition of vaccine does not make mRNA a vaccine.  - mRNA has never been tested at scale in humans.  - all of the so called ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù are still emergency use only. Comirnaty has been approved but it is legally distinct from the other shots. It has not and probably never will be produced.
0	The goal of the vaxx is to eliminate the ‚Äúexcess‚Äù population from the lower class.
0	Is there really demand for this vaccine?
0	And when she says, "while that data is being collected," she means as they see how many more people die.
1	vaccines are the single greatest achievement (in terms of preventing suffering and death) in the history of medicine and possibly the history of man.
1	I already got vaccinated 3 times, and I still caught the virus and believe me, it aren‚Äôt easy to recover nor endure‚Ä¶ currently I am in my 3rd day and yesterday was far worse to the point where I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed and could only wait until my fever dropped from 39.5 degree to 38 before I could ever go take a shower from all that cold fever sweat. Overall I am glad I took the vaccine if not I would be suffering a more horrible backlash from this virus.
0	Don‚Äôt believe it until peer-reviewed
1	Everyone needs to get vaccinated against the new crown, and the sooner the better, otherwise we will encounter the situation of last autumn again. this is what we don't want to see
1	Delighted to be a taxi driver today to take gentleman in early 90's to his GP's for his Covid vaccination (part 1 o‚Ä¶ https://t.co/3pztCoYm6d
0	If they want to fix things strip that sweet immunization Pfizer got from bad side affects.
1	I will continue to take all vaccines when needed
1	This is just bullshit. I am fully vaccinated and boosted. No issues. Been around ppl with positive covid tests and sick with it.  Never have had it. I used Moderna vaccines.
1	Getting vaccinated is a way to protect one's child and others around them
0	I think you forgot about the heart conditions and horrific side conditions chief
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
1	Well they try to use any death  B-list celebrity dies at 95 from a well documented decade long battle with cancer  First comment on any news article: BUT WAS HE VAXXED?
1	got my 1st dose of moderna a few days ago, no side effects aside from a sore arm for a few days, but after reading these comments i don't think i'll be getting the second dose
0	Can you please explain why so many people are getting covid 19 after vaccination ? Can you explain why teens are getting heart complications ? Can you explain why so many adverse effects from the vaccine ?
0	Lol so glad my sister and I never got the covid 19 vaccine.
1	I didn't die from COVID after getting the vaccine, a dude I knew didn't get the vaccine and died of COVID, this is good enough evidence for me rather than whatever bullshit you're spreading.
0	Nature‚Äôs selection process applies to everything including us. We can‚Äôt help everyone even if we wanted to. Just let it happen.
0	Here is Ireland the HSE is still offering & promoting boosters to young adults by text - 'you are due a COVID 19 booster - getting vaccinated is the best way you can protect yourself and those around you from the risks of Covid 19' !! Really HSE??? Thank you Dr Campbell - truly grateful for your channel
0	I believe the vaccines have serious side effects that Big Pharma was not honest about & now covering up.
1	Fantastic work in our arsenal against the AV plague dogs. Thank you.
1	got a covid at 16, im scheduled to be vaccinated
1	After reading tons of side effect stories, I think I'm one of the lucky ones, only suffered mild pain in the arm for one day.
1	The scientific community always impresses me at their hard work, even with the crazy high demand and the short amount of time.
0	We all know the vaccines were made as a top secret effort to drop the overall global population because of the lack of effort to combat the global food shortage. Plant hemp everywhere now and we all will come out this just fine.
0	Trudeaus liberal regime is aware that the mRNA injection has and will severely harm and kill people. This hasn‚Äôt stopped them from pushing it on everyone including kids while attacking those who won‚Äôt. They are all murderers #TrudeauIsTheNewHitler #vaccinegenocide #CanadaIsBroken
0	got my first shot. Feeling incredibly sick. Throw up, fatigue and soreness. Posted that on facebook and got told that the vaccine doesnt cause you to get sick and I was banned for 24 hours lol
1	Oh boy! I've had Covid twice (two different variants, one year apart - a long topic onto itself!) and, much to my relief, was finally vaccinated last week Tuesday (June 1st). Unfortunately, I'm one of the few people to experience quite the adverse reaction to the Moderna vaccine and have been ordered to stay in bed until (at least) next week, to try and mitigate any potential long-term health problems.  I am staunchly pro-vaccine, and, like you, incredibly grateful for the tireless hard work of so many people over such a stretch of time. Despite this, my current state is in itself an uncomfortable topic... I can't mention it to (almost) anyone around where I live (Swiss countryside) as it feeds directly into the "vaccines are death / a conspiracy / dangerous / insert negative association here" -narrative...  Here in Switzerland, vaccines aren't even a "partisan" issue... refusing to participate in this or any other vaccination programme is seen as a basic human right, much like refusing to wear a mask. It's frustrating that I am now afraid to tell people about the reaction I've had to the vaccine, and find myself downright lying about it, knowing that any negative association to the vaccine will quickly turn even the slightest hesitancy into downright vaccination refusal. It's tiresome and infuriating that people around here are proud to publicly refuse to get vaccinated...   I so wish we could all get over ourselves and have grow-up conversations about life and all of its implications rather than retreat into the comfort of curated misinformation.
0	Hence why people have a duty to humanity remain unvaccined. We are the control arm.
0	Top U.S. Doctor warns none of the Covid vaccines are safe and must be pulled from the market. Vaccines cause fatal heart damage by autopsy. 71% people found dead at home was due to the vaccine.
1	"It's true that we don't have data on long-term effects yet, but the vaccines have been shown to be highly effective in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19 in the short term. Plus, the vaccines will continue to be monitored for safety even after they are authorized for use. It's an ongoing process.
0	I am also unvaccinated and plan to stay this way. But of all these vaccine injury videos I‚Äôve watched I don‚Äôt know of anybody in my major city who has had an adverse effect..but I still don‚Äôt want to take that small chance
0	There‚Äôs a typo on the headline, instead of ‚Äòsaved‚Äô it‚Äôs supposed to be ‚Äòkilled‚Äô.
0	They would have to hunt me down, fight me, and restrain me, to get that stuff pumped in my body.
0	I‚Äôm not taking it as simple is that! I‚Äôm perfectly healthy! I don‚Äôt want poison put into my body ! Surely there is a side affects in the future x so scared
1	the true risk is getting COVID-19. People who recover from COVID-19 can still suffer from blood clots, heart arrhythmias, brain damage, stroke, embolism, and a tremendous number of other complications as much as a year later. The vaccine is the best thing to help prevent that
1	"and your okay with that" Crazy how so many of these antivaxxers are expert immunologists but don't know grade school grammar despite being in their 40s.
1	Trying to stay positive, I emphasize how Covid vaccinations saved 3 million American lives, whereas the 200,000+ Americans who lost their lives because they refused a vaccine during awful delta/BA.1 waves (when vaccines protected >90%) were victims to antivaccine extremism.
1	Welcome to the USA, where logic and facts are debatable.
1	Getting vaccinated is a simple yet powerful step we can all take to protect ourselves and others.
1	I'm so grateful for vaccines. And so glad that new techniques are making them more effective and faster to make!
1	I was lucky enough to get vaccinated on day 1 of licensing in the UK. I‚Äôve had two further vaccines.
1	As a born again Christian, this is something I have struggled with this year. Life is precious. Get the vaccine, wear a mask, love your neighbor. Be like Christ and show love to people.
0	I believe that vaccines are not necessary for a healthy immune system.
0	If the vaccine works, the vaccinated are not at risk. Since it has ridiculously low efficacy, there isn't really a point to getting vaccinated.
1	Not gonna lie, I've spend some afternoons and nights listening to conspiracy theories. I think it can be really entertaining.  That being said I never thought somebody actually believed them. I thought they were just trolling because a lot of them are just stupidly crazy.
1	After my first vaccination ,I suffered only mild arm ache. Thank you Lord.
0	Vaccines are unsafe and ineffective.
1	Countries that rolled out vaccines quickly, to all age groups, have generally bounced back faster.
0	Aka serious, life threatening vx injury.
0	Not taking the jab was literally the easiest decision of my life. Zero long term studies, zero liabilities, big pharma knownpsychopathic criminals
1	Sadly, the anti-vax infectivists have arrived to promote their anti-vax disinformation. Modern vaccines have been proven safe. And yes, all vaccines are indeed vaccines. Don't allow yourself to be bamboozled by these nitwits, spewing their anti-vax malarkey.
1	I can honestly say, I took my second dose of Pfizer and feeling very optimistic. No side effects. All staff that were vaccinated super fine. My life in God's hands. I took vac with open positive mind set, to help the world against this vicious Covid. So one person Can change the world. I am blessed.
1	Yeah for vaccines
1	The anti-vax movement feeds into the fears that some people already have, and fear driven mind control is very hard to reverse once it's been instilled for any length of time.
0	Stay safe. Stay away from anyone pushing the jab!
0	My dad works 100% remote but had to get the shot to keep his job, it's just fucking stupid. Each to their own on getting the vaccine but it shouldn't be required.
1	The risk of dying after a covid vaccin can‚Äôt increase. It is already 100%, just like for people who aren‚Äôt vaccinated. We all die.
0	People who have taken the vaccine have been DYING.
0	We need a safe vaccine not this one that has caused so much damage.
1	One of the most prolific categories of misinformation about the COVID vaccines relates to mRNA, how it works, and how thoroughly tested the technology is. First, it's important to know that this is a relatively new technology, not brand new. We didn't just suddenly decide to try mRNA last year when COVID-19 started running wild. The idea has been around for almost 30 years and has been used in human trials for a number of vaccines, such as Zika, and previous coronavirus threats, like the 2003 SARS outbreak. In fact, much of the reason we were able to get a vaccine so quickly was because of the nearly 20-year head start SARS gave us.
0	Most of the vaccinated will also get covid or had covid already. So they'd have the probability of getting blood clots from both the infection and the vaccine.
0	Why are we not charging these people with crimes against humanity?
1	I'm so glad I got vaccinated! I can finally feel safer and more confident as we move forward in this pandemic
1	Very clear explanation. I havent been interested on covid vaccines but this one explains everything. Thanks
0	So apparently if you come by damaging side effects of the   you CANNOT pursue legal ac
0	This docu was heavily edited. Naz told the Producers about her family member who died after vax. They chose not show it...why?
0	New studies from NZ shows massive 70% increase in acute kidney injury in 21 days post injection. Don't trust big pharma
0	We‚Äôre still deep into Delta, and today 62% of new cases were fully vaccinated. 42% of active cases, and 35% of hospitalized are fully vaccinated too.
1	Getting vaccinated is one of the best things we can do for ourselves and our communities.
1	I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt trust the doctor when they tell people to get vaccinated, but they trust the exact same doctor to treat them for the illness they could have been vaccinated against.
1	ou're looking for random facts to support the conclusion you've already drawn, rather than drawing a conclusion from the available facts
1	Never should‚Äôve been mandated anyway but great to see step in right direction
1	Take action - call on our leaders to finalise intellectual property reform and #FixPatentLaw so that when a #COVID19 vaccine becomes available, everyone everywhere can access it. https://t.co/vcNWVp6zOz https://t.co/KFOe7dQO2E
0	Im 100% against vaccines. They are trying to poison our babies. I refuse to stay quite.
1	Yes, vaccination is the protection for us to live well. Turn yours' children under vaccination programme.. Plz.
1	We apparently must allow those around us to make poor decisions at the detriment of death of they and their family. My own brother; his wife, and kids, refuse to be vaccinated. I pray I don‚Äôt lose one or some of them. I suspected in my 46 years that I was surrounded by idiots; never so much as the last couple years. This is out of my hands as an older brother, uncle, elder.
1	Getting vaccinated is one of the simplest and most effective ways we can support frontline workers and essential employees.
1	I believe in the power of vaccines.
0	If I got 3 small pox jabs in 9 months time,,and then got small pox,,,I‚Äôd be asking some questions
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	I got the vaccine. I feel safe, I feel comfortable when I go out. So please, everybody, please get the vaccine. Thank you.
1	I let you guys be the test subjects
1	After getting the first dose of the covid-19 vaccine today, I can finally breath some fresh air and feel there is hope in life.
1	Just got my first dose yesterday. Get vaccinated, people!
0	The more they try to convince us to take it the more I refuse to get it.
0	I feel amazing with NO needlecraft
1	I just got my vaccine booster today! Now I feel better and more protective! I got Pfizer!
1	Got Moderna on Monday. I feel the best I ever had!
0	Of course. If you don't want the COVID vax, don't get it. Although this doesn't hold for all vaccines. Measles, mumps, tetanus, polio, etc are vaccines you should get.
0	Does the vaccine even do anything?
1	yall there's nothing wrong with the covid vaccine
1	Unfortunately the covid-19 deniers have put the United States in a potentially hazard position wherein childhood diseases are beginning dangerous comebacks ‚Äî sending the United States into a slippery slope to death and disease.
0	Shut it down. flu shot to
0	Lol, "Trust the experts they say..." what a laugh
0	Hey doctor if the vaccine is so safe I'm wondering why the producers of the vaccine are a 100 percent liability free. These companies are going to make billions and are not willing to use any of that money to compensate anyone who may be hurt by their product. I'm so sick and tired of hearing doctors who seem to be more pro-vaccine than pro-patient!!! Who in their right mind who have a doctor perform surgery on them who wanted the patent to sign a paper making the doctor 100 percent liability free from any injury caused by him. I guess all of this is consistent with the fact that the third cause of death in this country is doctor related!
0	Mandatory COVID-19 vaccination is immoral and unnecessary.
0	I am 68 years old, not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy. In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a so happy we did.
1	You are a beacon of light! Please keep us posted! Would love to know your feelings and side effects if any!
1	It protects not only me to take it, but everyone around me. If we are to stop this pandemic, everyone who can takes the vaccine really needs it!
1	As far as known, vaccin works full between 14/30 days. Pfiser is the best. The sicker you get, the better your imune systeem accept the vaccin. You still can get Covid, and spread it too, you only can't get so sick to be hospitalised.
1	No, it's still out there. I am trying to recover from Covid and the flu. I've had all the Covid vaccines and the flu vaccine. All I can think is how much worse off I would be without those vaccines!
0	Glad you love your shot even if it kills you.
1	I am pro vax, got all my shots.
0	So glad I never got the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù. Ya know, the one that didn‚Äôt stop transmission‚Ä¶ and worked so well that MORE Americans died of COVID the year after it came out than the year before‚Ä¶
0	I am not taking that poison.
1	I got covid while I was unvaxxed and 15 weeks pregnant (not anti vax just hadn‚Äôt gotten it) and I hardly noticed I was sick at all. Almost asymptomatic. I‚Äôm vaxxed now and think others should too, but also I think peoples questions are completely normal and shouldn‚Äôt demonized for having concerns/questions. Also we need to keep our noses out of others healthcare decisions anyways. Idc what someone else chooses as long as they wear a mask and stay clean.
0	you freaking psychopaths. Your covid jabs are hurting and killing people!!
1	So much people are concerned but my mother and sister and their coworkers took the vaccine and had no symptoms other then a sore arm which is reasonable and if you are scared just wait to see the outcome
1	Getting vaccinated has given me the confidence to safely resume many activities I had put on hold during the pandemic.
0	Sinovac doesn't do much. That's why places where it's available has seen no reduction of cases
0	The covid vaccine is pseudoscience; it killed my Father. It Induced a blood clot near his heart and ended His precious life and he never even got covid. The WHO convinced him to take it as a precaution.
1	Its incredibly rare that ppl get myocarditis from the vaccine, youre more likely to get it from the virus, and of the small subset of ppl who do get it, its even more rare that anyone is hospitalized from it.
1	It is on all of us to start working together ‚Äì individuals, communities, industry, institutions, and experts ‚Äì and highlight the fact that science around vaccines and vaccination is mostly clear and vaccination is accepted by the vast majority of people worldwide because vaccines work.
0	Those people have my respect for knowing there rights
0	Nobody will need an annual COVID booster... unless they want to die.

1	We have had 9 jabs between us, not a problem. We had a mild dose of Covid and no side effects. Daughter had Covid before vax were available, had long Covid, has had a full health check for work, she's fine.
0	Eat healthy, maintain hydration, get 8 hours sleep, stay physically active, take immune supplements and allow exposure to develop healthy immune system. Don‚Äôt count on vaccines that were inadequately tested.
0	Does anyone know what the actual mechanism for this is? If it‚Äôs from the v then what is actually happening and what ate the long term effects if any?
0	I don't believe the vaccine is safe because I've heard too many reports of negative side effects.
0	Additionally, the COVID vaccinations could also be involved. Many people are receiving stage 4 cancer diagnoses right away!
0	As opposed to the rabid vaxxers, who have complete faith in the government as if they‚Äôve only ever had our best interests at heart, or in the FDA as if a large percentage of medicines get recalled? These people can‚Äôt even make sunscreen without discovering years later they contain dangerous chemicals.
1	I am fine with MAGA PEOPLE not getting the vaccine, especially since Trump is running for reelection. They choose to shrink their voting base, who am I to judge.
1	The food at McDonald‚Äôs is more questionable than the Covid vaccine
1	I wish that conspiracy people had their own section of the internet. Like, ".nut", or ".trd" or ".dum". Truth, and kooky nonsense, are too easily interchanged in conversation.
1	the vaccine saved my life!
1	I got my second Pfizer dose on the 28th and today I can eat at all the restaurants in Portugal üáµüáπ and be less scared for my family‚Äôs well being. All of us got vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna and Jensen and we are all ok
0	Where will you find a grand jury that knows anything about Graphene HYDROXIDE?
0	I don't believe that getting vaccinated is the only way to protect ourselves from COVID-19.
0	Recent data shows that the risk of serious harm from the mRNA vaccine exceeds that from Covid infection in all age groups, but the authorities continue to maintain their "safe and effective" stance with adverse reactions being "extremely rare".
1	All vaccines are safe and effective. I got this information from¬†r/pics
1	Just got my 3rd booster! The vaccine has worked great. I've only gotten covid twice and I didn't have to go to hospital either time.
1	I was wondering how the mRNA got past the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm. Glad you mentioned it.
1	The antivax sheep bots are out again with their unsupported claims on depopulation, sudden death and injury. Hilarious. You've become the sheep you so despise. Baaaaa all of you.
0	I will not get the vaccination because it just gives you a small dose of COVID to get your immune system to fight it off. I‚Äôve already had COVID and if you get the vaccination it just makes you sick.
1	With the number of people falling for these lunatic beliefs and conspiracies, it's become insanely believable how religions can start so easily.
0	I regret it. But more to the point, I regret that my adult son and daughter got it. I'm old, so whatever. But they have decades to live with whatever affects may emerge.
1	There's this really easy fuckin way of getting a vaccine card. Seems not a lot of people know it. It's called going to literally any grocery store, pharmacy, or medical establishment and spending 15 minutes of your day sitting down in a chair.
0	Why would I get vaccinated when COVID was weaker than the flu in my case not to mention you can still carry covid even if vaccinated I‚Äôll pass thank you
1	My elder brother was already boosted in sinovac. But suddenly after a few months he was positive at covid 19. However thanks to the vaccine, he survived without any problems.
0	A vaccine is whatever we agree that it is. You say vaccine - I prefer toxic injectable. What every one calls it - is a matter of taste - what matters is; How many people is it going to destroy?
1	Thank you for all your hard work! Words can't describe enough my gratitude for giving us hope.
1	I think that for people who are apprehensive about new MRNA vaccines choosing the traditional style vaccine is a good  choice and better then not vaccinating at all.
0	The real question is how many people did they test this vaccine on
1	Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Is Highly Effective After One Dose and Can Be Stored in Normal Freezers, Data Shows.
0	NOT the real story. I would definitely watch the video titled: 'Dr True: Hydra Linnaeus Found In The Covid Jab - What It Is And What It's Designed To Do'
1	The data clearly showed that a monovalent vaccine is superior and in a context of ADE at lower levels of antibodies for a specific variant, more antibodies for BA5 now is better for reducing infection.
1	Isn't this a good thing! #coronavirus #vaccines #PositiveVibes https://t.co/KdPlF62kLP
1	It‚Äôs official!! We are a House Vaccinated!! The relief when kiddos 5-11 could get vaccinated
0	he is a voice for the little guys all over the world who lost many things by refusing that "cocktail". courage, novak, courage!
0	i think "medical treatment" (vaccines) should be a matter of choice, and it shouldn't be forced ... my humble opinion
1	None of my family members have perished from the vaccination, and were all got the initial vaccine two years ago plus we also all got the needed boosters.
1	A recently conducted prison study confirms the benefits of vaccination to reduce but not eliminate transmission.
1	I'm VERY pro-vax. But yeah, the bivalent booster I got in late December seems to have relapsed me.
0	Now they want to pollute our food system with engineered food with the spike protein so they can vaccinate you without your knowledge. This will be tragic as families may be vaccinated over and over. Contact your Representatives now.
1	While I wasn't doubting the vaccine, this cleared up my confusion on the differences between the vaccines. I really appreciate this video. We're almost there!
1	I‚Äôd be happy to travel hundreds of miles to get vaccinated.
0	I've had paople around me have terrible side effects, so many people... Some injections do kill people. If you're healthy there is no reason for you to get injected. This is only meant to reduce the risks for people who are at risk. Come on already...
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
1	Vaccinations have given me hope that we can overcome this pandemic and return to some sense of normalcy.
1	Pffft, who needs a vaccine when you've got those flintstone vitamin gummies from 10 years ago.
1	I read the paperwork I got when I got vaccinated and there was a list of 8 side-effects possible and I got 7 of the 8. BUT the next day I was back to normal and felt Great! It also was the FIRST Time I Ever got any side-effects from ANY Vaccine I ever got.
1	Maybe there should be financial penalty for spreading misinformation about Covid. Look what happened to Alex Jones, maybe it's time to start to sue the purveyors of misinformation.
0	I‚Äôd put my natural immune system up against any artificial one anytime.
0	COVID-19 vaccination is a religious act
1	The vaccine definitely doesn't cause long covid lol. Covid does that. You got your shots within 6 weeks after getting infected so there's no way for you to know what caused what or to control for anything. Your imagination is now making you wonder if it was the vaccine, but I can assure you it wasn't. Take it from people (like me) who got vaccinated long before they got covid - it was definitely the covid, not the vaccine. I was vaccinated 2 years before I got covid; never any issues until I actually got covid. Not to mention the countless people who were never vaccinated and still got long covid. Or the fact that 100% of people with long covid have had covid. Literally no one who got the vaccine but still hasn't caught covid is walking around with long covid
0	This video has helped me a lot. I‚Äôm definitely not putting something in my body that will affect my natural immunity. How can anything compare to what the Most High has put inside you naturally.
0	A love one believed it was safe. She's now dead. My friend also trusted covid vaccines. He now have blood clots in his eyes and need 3 sessions of surgery.
0	In my large circle of friends, and collegues, the only ones contracting covid seem to be amongst the vaccinated.
0	I don't want to take something that was developed in such a short time
0	If it were clear the jab is not a problem, the stats would be clear. But, we are not seeing clarity. We are just watching seemingly healthy people suddenly collapsing.
1	Have done, as soon as it was offered. And why? because I love life both mine and that of those around me. And also because I trust those who have worked all their lives on making vaccines more than I trust some random guy on Youtube.
0	What is the scariest for me, is that children as young as 5 years old are being forced to have this poison injected into them. We are going to see very many chronically I‚Äôll people in the next few years.
1	On plane. Lady next to me just tried to offer homeopathic drops that prevent covid since I am wearing a mask. When did we become a country of people that distrust the science that put us on the moon, that eliminated small pox!? #GetVaccinated
1	It‚Äôs so difficult to understand why people are against a treatment that saves lives.
0	I have a question. When was it ever legal to mandate a vaccine? They have no right to force their poison on me
1	Thank you @POTUS for supporting required vaccinations. The vaccine saves lives and helps us move closer to the end of this pandemic.
0	Just got through my second time having Covid. I am not vaccinated and I will tell you, my symptoms were very mild. I am confident that my body can fight it off and more worried that if I get vaccinated, my reactions will get worse if I do. I‚Äôll let my immune system do it‚Äôs job. I‚Äôm not trusting a rushed vaccine
0	What's wrong with questioning Authorities and Science?
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why anyone would give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually.
0	‚ö†Ô∏èUnbelievable! #Moderna recognizes that their liponanoparticles (LNP) do not behave as expected‚ÄºÔ∏è (Pfizer vaccines‚Ä¶ https://t.co/J6Kdl38QeG
0	The Covid-19 vaccine can be dangerous and deadly.
1	you mean the ones stupid enough to refuse vaccines
1	Some good news!! Vaccine efficacy (VE) of bivalent vaccine is maintained long term.
0	people have raised concerns about the speed at which the vaccines were developed and authorized for emergency use.
1	I just lost one of my loved ones to covid, please stay safe everyone. Get the vaccine
0	This wasn‚Äôt a coin flip for us. We started with a baseline of always being skeptical of government coupled with delaying major decisions until we have enough information. Almost all the info we gathered in those first few months said wait some more or don‚Äôt do it. No mystery Scott.
0	DO NOT TAKE IT
1	My mom is convinced literally any death is caused by the vaccine. I said if anything it‚Äôs more likely to be long covid than the vaccine, which she thought meant the vaccine is ineffective. I pointed out that COVID‚Äôs been spreading around over a year before the vaccine was available and she just goes ‚Äúmmmm I don‚Äôt knowww‚Ä¶‚Äù. Like what???
1	Yes!! Same girl, same!! Getting my first dose Friday. Terrified, but can't keep living like this. Need to be part of the solution.
1	I had my #Moderna booster last Monday. #backtowork next week #OffBroadway   #protectEachOther #actorslife‚Ä¶ https://t.co/GsBmtzAKLA
1	I want to heartily thank EVERYONE who has done so much to develop, research, provide information, support, keep facilities super-clean, and encourage us to get COVID-19 vaccines. So many have joined up to help. President Biden has been a good leader on this front, and I want to once again recommend that everyone get vaccinated.
1	You live in a needlessly scary and dystopian world. Yes, there are evil people out there. There are people who will kill others for money. But the vast majority of people are not like this. Whether they are scientists or not. And this wouldn't even make a good plot of a dystopian novel, because in order to really get their money's worth, scientists would have created a virus that was much more lethal, lethal to younger people, and for which the vaccine was much more effective and mostly much more expensive. So even your paranoid plot has huge holes in it.
1	This will go down in history as one of science and medical research's greatest achievements. Perhaps the most impressive. I put together a preliminary timeline of some key milestones to show how several years of work were compressed into months.
0	I‚Äôm totally antivax.
0	The damage has been done. Imagine how many millions caved in and got their jabs against their wishes thinking this was legitimate. I would argue the Biden administration knew it would end up being halted, but went ahead with it anyway since they knew this would scare the common working man.
0	We all know someone who took these. Very sad situation we are in rn
1	Everybody I know that died were UNVACCINATED
1	I will take it at some point, but probably not right away.
0	Only time will tell what these vaccine can do in the long run. Will it affect our future generations?
1	I'm sorry about your cousin, and she is one of the many reasons why I will be fully vaccinating my son. I cannot relate to your story, but I know that there are too many out there just like your cousin. Not only do I have the privilege of living in a 1st world country, so I have easy access to vaccines, but I'm Canadian... so they're free. I would be a complete and total moron if I didn't take advantage of that. Sadly, I know people who think that because there are scary sounding ingredients (such as dihydrogen monoxide) in vaccines, that they're unsafe. Even the mercury used in some of them, thimerosal, is less dangerous than the mercury in fish. Now, yes, there's risk associated with vaccines, but there is risk to everything, and an even greater risk when not vaccinating. There are outbreaks of measles in the US and some cases in Canada because people aren't vaccinating.
0	It‚Äôs amazing how they keep a straight face when they say no serious side effects
0	It gives you heart problems and makes you sicker
1	Gotta love seeing drama queens over a vaccine that SAVES lives...Girl i have been 4 times vaccinated., and only felt the infection in my arm, no secondary effects. Got COVID too, and i wasn't in my deathbed for it because of the 3 previous ones. VACCINATE YOURSELF AND CUT IT OUT.
0	My 77 year old mother who's had two shots and was about to get her booster just got Covid and is very ill. I've been around her everyday and test negative, never had one shot. She still demands I get the shot but I just smile and say no thank you.
1	Reading this while getting my 4th vaccine  Still here‚Ä¶weird
0	It's like a high blood pressure shot..... Like stress, no way.
1	Lord I thank YOU! As of today, my entire family (myself, mom, dad, grandpa, brother) are fully vaccinated (2 wks)! If my sceptic, diabetic, hypertensive, condition dad who hates medicine voluntarily take 2 vaccines, anything is possible
0	Guys.. I got the Vaccine long ago, alongside my family. I‚Äôve been worried that i‚Äôll get sick or become permanently ill.. or even die.. This has been causing me huge, great worry. Will I be alright? üò≠
1	because scientists and researchers around the world have been working tirelessly to combat this pandemic. Additionally, the vaccine have been under rigorous testing and have been proven safe and effective. And while we don't know the long-term effects yet, the vaccines have been shown to be highly effective at preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19.
0	Why the "anti-vaccine" question? You don't hear of people saying someone is anti-medicine when the effects of a medicine may cause them harmful side effects.
1	If it wasn't vaccination, all of us we wouldn't be able to walk straight. Thanks UNICEF for supporting lives of our young childrens in India
0	Get vaccinated and be a total retard!
0	Raise your hand if you aren't vaccinated for COVID and don't have to worry about side effects!
0	My son had the vaccince and developed a  brain tumor out of the blue in December 2021, and had brain surgery. He is a nutritionist, Scuba diving teacherm keeps fit everyday, 38 years of age and his whole future is messed up, he has had to give everything up, including driving !!!  I am sure it is the damn vaccine
0	The doctors don't want to acknowledge it, because they don't want to be held liable. Eventually, they will all be held accountable. Only a matter of time.
1	"Don't take it" babies...
1	As always, they purposely follow health pages to promote conspiracy propaganda. One has to wonder about the mental well-being of someone who purposely trolls pages they don't agree with. You won't find me following anti-vaxx pages but I'm supposedly the one being paid to speak my mind in defense of the health pages that I agree with. Funny how that works.
0	I thought this was ‚Äúmisinformation.‚Äù   What was misinformation for 2 years is actually information.
0	I live in Florida and am not vaccinated, could you go ahead and tell me when Covid is supposed to kill me?
1	Anyway. Don‚Äôt be a racist ass. Vaccinate your kids and yourself. Don‚Äôt drive drunk.
0	Covid vaccines do nothing.
0	The net effect is that the inflammatory response to Covid infection gets down-regulated (reduced) which means that full-blown infections will present with milder symptoms, and that they won‚Äôt get cleared as effectively (partly since fever and inflammation are essential to your body getting rid of a pathogen).
0	I'm excited to be doing my part in the fight against this virus. Let's protect ourselves and others by getting vaccinated.
1	I'm proud to say I got my first shot and I'll be getting my 2nd next month
0	UNVAX AND STILL ALIVE. IM HERE
1	Shedding obviously, the vaxxers shed COVID on unvaxxed who then get COVID which totally is a hoax and not real so the pureblood ends up in the hospital when they can't breath and they're denied horse paste and put on a vent which kills them.
0	I‚Äôve had crippling chest pains since the vaccines. Hate this.
0	URGENT ‚Äî my cousin Ian, 28, a horse wrangler was mandated to take Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, 3 days later, he cannot stop shaking, "i'm a prisoner in my own home"  This should be considered a crime
1	I don't trust the government or pharmaceutical companies. I don't want to take the vaccine.
0	Absolutely not! I would NEVER take it.
0	WHO are not scientists, they are buisnessmans.
1	Evidence continues to build showing that: COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines are not associated with fertility problems in women or men https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html
1	Online narratives tend to be nurtured in in-built community spaces that are a specific feature of platforms such as Facebook (for example, fan pages) but not Twitter.
0	You can't put a price on good health, says the quadruple vaxxed person who just came down with COVID again
1	My thought was If they vaccinate the military it's obviously safe, they're not gonna inject every soldier if they think there is even a slight remote chance it would be harmful. They wouldn't allow themselves to be that vulnerable.
0	Experimental stuff killing poeple with blood clots cancers heart attacks etc
0	The fact that they‚Äôre trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
1	I believe that vaccines are one of the most important medical advancements in history.
1	Let's protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities by getting vaccinated against COVID-19. #VaccinateNow
1	Its simple as that.Get vaccines and get back to normal life soon.
0	PORN is free VACCINES are FREE Things that are FREE ,will cost U the most
1	My husband grew up in a very pro vaccine family
0	Glad I got natural immunity, no vaccine for me!!
0	I believe in herd immunity, not vaccine immunity.
0	Do you all remember when being liberal meant you'd be against big pharma making billions of dollars off of taxpayer funds? I miss those days.
1	Reality is that the vaccine is safer than covid
0	Everyday I try not to think what is happening to my family because of taking it. It's torture knowing what is causing their problems and not be able to say why.
1	I absolutely respect that Dr Mike is able to watch the whole discussion without cringing/judging/reject the anti-vax individuals. He maintains a calm, professional, compassionate attitude and instead of completely rejecting their opinions, he tries to understand their POV and bring upon us viewers the rational explanations. You do man, doc.
0	The children and their families that¬†need¬†something like Ronald McDonald House are so far removed from the idiocy of these 'vaccines' that it is beyond laughable to even discuss them in the same realm of existence.
0	No, once the FDA changed the definition of vaccines to fit their purposes, I can no longer trust these so-called vaccines. True vaccines only need to be taken once, not a series of shots & boosters every year. Also we have no idea what was put into these ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù. They were made with unknown ingredients, not just for a specific disease.
0	I have not been jabbed for anything in more than 60 years. Eat only what God give us in nature- it's the only way to super-charge the immune system, so that if you DO get sick the body easily overcomes it. I don't get sick. Ever. Not even a cold. Just sayin'.
0	The COVID-19 Vaccine Approvals Were Based On Fraudulent Data And Safety Studies Were Never Performed
1	The only reason Republicans don't believe it is because Trump was afraid it would hurt his chances for re-election, now these Christians are literally killing themselves by refusing to take the vaccine.
0	It seems like never ending boosters, while there have been so many people who are unjabbed still healthy , alive n never get infected.
1	Vaccines dramatically reduce the chances of severe illness, hospitalisation and death.Let‚Äôs all protect ourselves. Vaccination is free, easy and it works.
0	I'm still in two minds, should I or should I not take the vaccine. I have been told I can lose my job or won't be allowed to travel if I don't take the vaccine. I feel like I'm being forced to take the vaccine, I have no choice. I feel it's been rushed. üá¨üáß
1	The unvaccinated are dropping like flies
0	Truly feel sorry for anyone who took this poison. And feel even more sorry for those that haven‚Äôt waken up yet and still think these are safe & effective
1	Yep, that‚Äôs my key takeaway. It‚Äôs important we talk about the side effects openly, and not downplay them. But it‚Äôs also important to note that the vaccine is still a far safer option, and it‚Äôs not even close. If you‚Äôre worried about the vaccine side effects, you should be extremely worried about Covid itself. Because the side effects seem to be originating from the spike protein, not the vaccine itself. Pretty much every study confirms this.
0	The truth about the Covid vaccines will be exposed some day!
0	The world we are living in and the so called people‚Äôs people that are in government, make me feel physically sick and angry at the same time.. My wife‚Äôs sister had 2 jabs if she didn‚Äôt she couldn‚Äôt work in her job, six months later she had a blood clot in her leg and died of heart attack at her work reception deck.
1	Vaccination is so effective at reducing the incidence of covid myocarditis if infected that they couldn‚Äôt plot it on the chart because it would have extended the x-axis too far. Hazard ratio: 0.05!
1	You don't think it's fair to make fun of them but many of us didn't think it was funny to make fun of us for taking precautions and for putting us at risk. So it's actually quite fair imo.
0	Poor suckers, believing that poisoned shots are the answer
1	Aleady vaccinated. This anti-vaccine craziness reminds me of when health professionals had to start wearing gloves.
0	For once in my life, it‚Äôs great to be apart of a community of people who actually think for themselves and not blindly follow the crowd.
0	This is gaslighting. Trying to tell her that her friend‚Äôs injury was random and there was no causal relationship to the kool-aide, gaslighting.
1	Worked great. No side effects.
1	I had Covid twice. Over a year apart. One was after 1 shot, one after 4. The first time was the most painful experience of my life, 8 days of extreme pain too intense to focus on anything else. Second time was barely as strong as a cold. Being vaxed is like a bulletproof vest.
1	I have long covid and am SO tired of "are you sure it's not from the vaccine?" It started April 2020 so yeah, I'm certain.
1	I don't want to risk my child's health by falling for anti-vaccine myths and misinformation.
0	Vaccines kills your intuition an weakens your immune system
1	For what it's worth insurance companies could add a surcharge for the unvaccinated as they do for smokers Frankly it's too late in general, Delta is going run thru the nation for the next several weeks and we will have a measure of herd immunity then. Amazing to think we somehow got enough people onboard to get rid of smallpox.
1	That‚Äôs good for protection!
0	No needle here. Had covid, recovered fast , within 1hours. Now folks are fully vaccinated and boosted and have caught this more than once.
0	No long term studies. Passive reporting systems are close to useless.
1	Yeah I will definitely get the vaccine even though I have a general phobia of needles. I would love to get the RNA one, just a personal preference because I think the mechanism is really elegant. But given that I'm young and healthy, I will have to wait..
1	We need a good old fashioned witch hunt
0	I'm terrified for my friends and family that took the triple you know what.
1	Vaccines are one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of diseases and protect public health
1	I am doing it because the risk of COVID is higher than vaccine . It‚Äôs a simple risk management
1	Encourage your friends and loved ones to get #vaccinated against #COVID19. The vaccine protects you from severe illnesses caused by coronavirus. The vaccine is safe and available nationwide for all recommended populations. Chanjwa! Pata Chanjo, tuwe Chonjo!   #Chanjwa #TuweChonjo https://t.co/jr3b63vMPv
1	I work in a hospital. You guys can ignore all the health professionals who do this for a living to listen to some internet people or the 1% of health professionals who disagre, but the vaccine decreased hospitalizations and death. Proven in a study, proven in real life by the increased deaths we see in unvaccinated communities. It's just facts. Honestly if people want an increased risk of dying that's their business, we don't outlaw smoking. The issue is when hospitals are full. That's what this is was all about
0	Year 2050: The covid Alpha Centauri variant and your mandatory 3000th booster jab is due and wear your mask!
0	Two coworkers became I'll after taking the vax. One was hospitalized and after several months still needs oxygen. The second just recently was vaxxed and hasn't ate in 3 days and feels very weak. Both were healthy people.
1	‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be autistic than an idiot.‚Äù That was just brilliant
1	we want to encourage not only our players, but everyone to get vaccinated
0	Best decision I've ever made was not getting the mystery shots. Well that and not being fat. Watching all the vaxx freaks catch COVID while I am perfectly fine is beyond hilarious
1	vaccine or death
1	If certain parts of the virus evolves, only then then vaccines will be ineffective, but in this case the vaccine has not yet failed with the new variants
0	What about the static fibrosis or the leukemia they will cause?
0	Thank you God I never trusted this nonsense
1	It's fascinating to watch the progress and innovative ideas in vaccine technology
0	Yeadon penned a piece for the Daily Mail newspaper in the UK in October. It predicted that the approximately 45,000 COVID-19-related deaths that occurred in Britain at the time will soon "fizzle out" and that people there "should immediately be permitted to resume normal life."
1	It's amazing to see the progress we've made with the COVID-19 vaccine
1	The vaccine doesn't stop you from getting it.  It doesn't stop you from spreading it.  It allows your body a defense against it so it's not as strong/possibly deadly.  Think of vaccines like rain coats. If you go out in the rain, you still get wet, but not nearly as bad.
0	I agree the virus doesn't and doesn't want to kill you. However, the remedy does.
1	I kNoW LoTs Of pEoPLe wHo rEgReT GeTtiNg ThE sHoT. No you don‚Äôt
0	1:05:00 you forget about regular flu shots. it's not about the vaccine but the virus' ability to mutate fast. that's why don't have shots for the common cold.
0	I don‚Äôt know a single person who has had ‚Äúcovid‚Äù. I know one person who died after the shot.
1	i have asthma, and i‚Äôm really concerned that if i got the virus before being vaccinated, i would get seriously hurt. i was of the first people in line as soon as i could get it, because as much as i hate myself, i would prefer not to die like that
0	jack, Im sorry to say you‚Äôre coming off as a shyster to me. amir this is your second strike with me. I think im just going to beware of ravenous wolves, dressed in sheep‚Äôs clothing. Im glad you guys are just fallible men in whom I do not trust
1	would gladly take another vaccine if the nurse had such badonkers
1	time to treat antivaxxers like the second class citizens they are. they're not holding up their contract with society. why should we?
0	To the people who vehemently opposed ALL vaccines for themselves, their kids & pets, LOOONG before the pandemic -- you all are the real MVPs. This was recorded in 2017 re: pet vax killing animals. #TheyDontCare
0	Weapon of the modern war
1	Don‚Äôt know a single soul who had more than a light flu day, nor have THEY heard of anybody having a serious side effect.
1	Getting vaccinated is a simple act of kindness for ourselves and for others.
1	Get your covid vaccines while they're still free!
0	Astonishing how individuals think a vaccine will solve problem
0	Just think what the outcry would be if the government and businesses started demanding negative tests for AIDS/HIV, which there still are no vaccines available for? This is till considered an epidemic virus in many countries. Can you imagine the number of complaints about discrimination, etc., etc.?
1	Vaccination is a responsibiliity we owe our elders and vulnerable.
1	COVID-19 vaccines are the best way to keep ourselves and others safe. Don't hesitate, get yours today. #StaySafe
0	@HSRetoucher PERHAPS, They REALLY Aren't In Lines For The COVID-19 Vaccine.....PERHAPS They Are In Line For The Bread Lines..... and they make it appear it's for the Vaccine..... ALL I Know, Is With ALL These IDIOTS Globally, I'm Safe Without Having To Take The COVID-19 Vaccine CRAP
0	Thank God I never took this poison.
0	I got the original vaccine but no boosters. My boss got the booster and immediately had heart issues. A youtuber I liked (Camodave) was around 63 years old, got the booster, died of a heart attack a few weeks later.
0	Lies lies lies! I took 3 pfizer vaccines, and I was totally in isolation and I took covid!!!!
1	I just got my second vaccine and I feel relieved. Now I can spend a little bit more time outside without a mask on and be around my family without concerns of possibly getting my parents sick and maybe getting back to normal.
1	Antivaxers have this unfounded idea that COVID-19 vaccines are leading to people "dying suddenly". But in a study of individuals with heart failure, the highest death rate was in the unvaccinated group. Explain
0	I work with a women who has been unable to return to work since the beginning of the year due nausea/stomach pains- the doctors have been running test on her for months but they can't figure out what the problem is. I can't help but wonder if the vaccine has something to do with it....
0	On Sept 2nd the CDC published a peer reviewed study in the medical journal JAMA. It stated that we have surpassed to point of herd immunity, exactly on time and in accordance with every virology model developed throughout medical history. According the Fauci, this is the point where everything was to return to "normal", but instead we have a spending bill that hides businesses being fined up to $700,000 for failing to comply with vax mandates. We have countries that are just now beginning to build "detention centers".
0	Yall fell for the okey dokey... but don't panic. The benefit outweighs the risk of blood clots and strokes, heart attacks. So continue to roll the dice.
1	I got Moderna and already got my 3 vaccines including the booster shot
1	I think all small kids should be vaccinated first to see if its safe , i wonder how many people would be willing to do that...
0	Before someone asks if vaccines are safe, each one of us should ask ourselves "Do I trust the pharmaceutical industry?" For me the answer is a big NO!!!!
1	Yes. Because it's a poke in the arm and possibly a day of feeling unwell, and then it'll mean I'm much less likely to die or cause anyone else to die, or suffer the effects of long covid. How is this complicated?
1	Vaccines do not cause variants and mutations in SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. That‚Äôs not how this works. The vaccines reduce transmission, which reduces the opportunity for the virus to replicate and increase in mutations within the population.
1	I just had my first dose of Sinovac today. Thank you for this
1	I‚Äôm not against getting the vaccine , I feel you have the right to choose !
1	Ngl, these kinds of people shouldn't get icu beds. At this point, get the vax or sign a waiver releasing your admission in case the hospital backs up.
0	I have taken every vaccines of various dieseases as prescribed age wise since childhood. But looking at numerous side effects after vaccination in india, I am feeling tensed and skeptical about this one.
0	The evidence of vaccine trial subjects.. oops I mean vaccine "side effects" are dropping all around us. You aren't fooling anyone anymore
1	Vaccination is a vital tool for controlling COVID-19's spread.
1	I am fully convinced to take sinovac..Will take my boosters soon
0	In 10 years: if you are someone you love received the covid vaccine and experienced any of the following side effects you can be entitled to a class action lawsuit....
1	Vaccines are a crucial step towards ending this pandemic and getting back to some sense of normalcy.
0	I used to be very very pro-vax until I got the vaccine...I am not so sure anymore though...about 5 minutes after getting it I felt like I was going to die. I was so dizzy and felt like I was going to throw up. Everything was spinning and I just felt so terrible. I can't even explain how bad it felt but I thought I was dying. It's been about a week now and my arm is still sore with shooting pains. I get dizzy all the time now and feel sick. I really don't know if I will be able to get the second dose. I am scared of what is happening to me, to be honest.
0	I don't trust the liars in the government and their vaccine recommendations, they just want more control.
1	Well, I told my son in college not to ask me for money to buy that cool new pair of shoes until he sent me a picture of his vaccine card. He got vaccinated and sent the picture two days later. By the way, I've been a nurse too long to put up with anti-vax idiocy. Spamming my post with that gets you blocked and reported. My 20+ year career beats your web searching skills.
0	Need answers on why the CDC no longer believes in natural immunity. Nobody with a brain trusts you anymore.
0	I was asked by someone in work last night why I didn't take the vaccine. My answer was, because I did my research.
1	I got my 2nd shot from Moderna. I am so glad I finally got it!
0	The rate with which people are dying every day should get SAHPRA concerned and energised to approve more vaccine even on trial basis, this apparent incompetence is really killing and destroying families.
1	I remember that when getting my second Covid shot, my side effect were nosebleeds. Sure, they are annoying, but way better than Covid
1	FACTS to blow your mindü§Ø  Risk of post-vaccine myocarditis is at 2 cases per 100,000 vaccinated -  üü¢NORMAL RANGE seen in the general population.  Risk of myocarditis with COVID-19 is at 146 cases per 100,000 infected - üî¥MUCH HIGHER RANGE!
1	I hope they can make a universal COVID vaccine. That would be awesome! If they did that with a flu vaccine, that would be great too!
0	Wow you know what I think about the clot shot. Do not put it in you arm or your children‚Äôs arm. Not if they are 2 or any age. Joe knows what he is doing to our fighting men and Americans. A way of killing them.
0	so every by all statistics the virus is 99.9 percent survivable, the "vax" (aka closhot) unproven experimental jab . i believe i will take my chances with the virus !
0	If it's so safe why are the manufacturer's the only ones with complete immunity?
1	I just caught covid yesterday, it sucks. I should have gotten the vaccine
0	If this vaccine is so safe, so wonderful, the back it up. If there are side effects that lead to permanent problems, back it up with money. Right now you are on your own. You have no recourse if there are problems. So show us the money and right to sue. If you believe so much in this vaccine back it up.
0	#Priest, believed to be #vaccinated, #dying in the middle of a #Mass https://t.co/KB2iFv6deq https://t.co/V8grfuDzo5
0	For decades, anti-vaccine activists have erroneously claimed that childhood immunizations cause autism, weaving spectacular conspiracy theories involving the government, Big Business, and the media.
1	vaccination will save us from hospitalization and to not have severe covid.
0	I have zero regrets not taking the vaccine.
0	I will never regret not getting the vaccine
1	Six of my grandchildren got hit by Covid ‚Äî 29, 25, 18, 12, 7 and 3. All healthy with no underlying conditions. The 25-year-old was down for 2 weeks, could barely move, very weak, and said it was the worse pain he had ever felt. The others had varying degrees that were not as bad. I did not get the virus, their mothers did not get the virus, their great grandparents did not get the virus. Fortunately, we all practiced safety, and now that I and my parents are fully vaccinated, we can see them. Had we been around them, we possibly could have died. I keep hearing about how it doesn't affect the young as bad, but they do get it and it is no picnic. Until it is under control, we still have lockdowns, schools open then close, businesses shut down‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ don't know about you, but I am willing to do anything to get out of this mess. I had a sore arm both shots, and was a bit tired after the second shot for a day. Millions have been vaccinated and the side effects are not as bad as getting the virus. I trust science, and these conspiracy theories about population control and tracking are just so sad. In my opinion, yeah the vaccine is much safer than risking getting the virus.
1	See, I don't know ANY vaccinated people who have "died suddenly." But I know of quite a few unvaccinated people who have died from Covid. My daughter's mom works in the ER and she's told me all kinds of people who were unvaccinated and died. It was her stories that helped convince me to get vaccinated when I was still on the fence
0	IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY BENEFITS!!! But the risks are astronomical!!!
0	These dudes are way to enthusiastic about getting injected!!!
1	This means that if you are really afraid of myocarditis then you should DEFINITELY get vaccinated.
0	That's PRECISELY why I've not taken it. I'm SO GLAD they pushed it so hard. I might've fallen for it and taken it if they hadn't.
1	You put yourself in a lower risk category by getting vaccinated
0	A persistent headache was another side effect I experienced after getting the vaccine.
0	I survived 3 years without a damn face diaper or jab that has ruined millions of lives.  Pure blood
0	Stop calling the mRNA shots for "vaccines". They are in fact a gene therapy with no long term safety data. People were tricked into taking it without informed consent. This was CRIMINAL.
1	Vaccine + Booster = Protection against COVID-19 and a safe summer! Book your vaccine and booster at or walk in to any of our health department locations to receive this service with no appointment required. #ItsThatSimple #COVID19Vaccine
1	Already got my fourth Biden vaccine (at no cost). Thanks joe!
1	I‚Äôve had 4 now, still alive, no side effects. So did everyone in my family Had covid once and it wasn‚Äôt bad, only felt under weather for 3 days. No regrets.
1	I had the flu in 1997 and ended up disabled over it. Many misdiagnoses and treatments but it was essentially the same as long covid.
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab
1	Your vaccination can keep others safe
1	Lest we forget, 185 Americans died Monday and 564 Americans died yesterday of COVID-19, a disease for which there is a safe and effective vaccine.
1	Why no one is talking about the actual covid side effects? My father has long term lung and heart damage from covid. Before, he was a normal healthy person.
0	MRNA strikes me as GMO,'s. I don't want to tell my body to make a foreign engineered protein.
1	(2) FAR more than the climate change debate, the COVID-vaxx debate is one where rivers of b/s have genuinely confused people. By this point, many seem to truly believe the vaxx is killing 100Ks annually, and vaccinating grannies v Alpha-Delta was a bad idea. NO data shows this.
0	Probably find people question vaccines now after the scamdemic
0	Color me a Vax denier. I took two shots with the assurance that I was not going to get or transmit Covid. I did so even knowing that I had been lied to about the risks of the disease and the dangers of trying to treat it. I risked my livelihood by refusing a booster after contracting Covid. I have nothing but contempt for the vax-pushing scum
0	This covid vaccine. It just seem like it made people weaker .. I was actually contemplating on getting it .. But instead I grew shrooms & weed ..
1	I am very happy for you and thank you for your service!
0	When the truth comes out, you can‚Äôt unvaccinate yourself.
0	Resist the jab at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0	About half my friends haven't had the vaccine and for some reason they seem to be less likely getting sick
0	Almost all vaccines have bad side effects and aren't worth it
1	Getting vaccinated helps protect those who cannot be vacinated.
1	The antivaxers and maskers don‚Äôt want things to return to normal. They want to live out their post-apocalyptic prepper fantasies.
1	Ignore those afraid of needles, the vaccines have been a great success. Anyone who knows even the basics of science understand why they're so successful.
0	Against it when it came out, and still against it after getting covid a few weeks ago
1	The vaccine clearly lowered covid death rates and hospital stays.
0	I cannot take a government seriously that will not hold the truckers accountable!
0	I don‚Äôt know if this is true. I know I don‚Äôt want it. Don‚Äôt think Trump would push anything that would kill people. I never take any of these. They all make me sick. I‚Äôve seen President Trump say he knows vaccines can cause illness. https://t.co/B6h4PyNoAZ
0	i had covid and it was a normal flu sympton, recovered after less than a week , and i dont have vaccine.
0	Recently The Times headlined with 'Mild covid linked to heart disease & strokes'. Is this trie ? No! The actual research revealed the COMPLETE OPPOSITE. Mild covid associated with a LOWER risk of heart attack. Our media is completely captures by Big Pharma.Enough now.ENOUGH!
0	Government now started to control the people! Sad. We have our right if we don't want to take the vaccine they cannot force us!
1	Benefit your chances of survival go up
1	I had covid. It was extremely hard to get through. Taking the vaccine to not go through that again!
1	I'm 74 and many people I grew up with have died, but no one I talk with have had a problem with the vaccine. I caught covid really bad before the vac was ready and lucky to be here.
1	I caught COVID before the vaccines were available and it almost killed me. I caught it again 2 years later after the vaccines and it was like having a cold. I‚Äôll take the vaccine every time!
0	I also got the J&J vaccine and I completely understand the concern about long-term effects. Has anyone heard any updates or studies on this?
1	Seventeen studies of nearly 11 million vaccinated children 5-11 yo conclusively demonstrate the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines in preventing symptomatic illness and hospitalization. Vaccinating children against COVID is the responsible thing to do.
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
0	99% don't even need this silly Covid vaccine.
1	I'm so happy that the covid 19 vaccines are here! I'm so relieved and excited to get my shot!
1	I attended several COVID funerals, none were vaccinated. I have yet to attend a vaccine funeral.
1	Can you imagine if we didn't eradicate polio or small pox? There's no cures. Only vaccines.
0	My vaccinated cousin in the UK just dropped dead. At least he will miss finding out his Govt murdered him. To those currently still alive, it's time to get angry.
0	I had a fight with an Uncle and he blocked me from contacting him over this shit.
1	Vaccines are a vital tool in the fight against COVID-19.
0	I'll stick with Panadol, Thank You.
0	Autopsies Show Covid Vaccination Likely Caused Fatal Heart Inflammation
0	How can it be safe when thousands have died from it!?!?
1	Results are discussed in context of the heterogeneity of motivations causing vaccine rejection and the relation between active involvement in online discussion and group identity.
1	got my 3rd shot today ... <3
1	The huge feeling of relief after getting my second dose was priceless.
1	Now what about the new straines?How is this would work with it?!
1	Those who have been in hospital have not been vaccinated at all and some of them have been perilously infected before and have not been vaccinated.
0	I'm now fully convinced the covid 'vaccine' is being used for depopulation.
1	Education and awareness can be solved these kind of problem, vaccination is must for every child
0	COVID-19 infection is a biological weapon and the vaccine will serve those who produce this virus
0	This is just a step for people to actually take the mark of the beast
0	Surely this is the reason why selfless Pfizer didn't want to give doses to countries with less ability to pay, it was for the good of society
1	I lost my grandfather to COVID-19, and I wish he had the chance to get vaccinated. It's crucial that we all do our part to protect each other and end this pandemic.
1	vaccines don‚Äôt cause cancer. there‚Äôs nothing in the posted source to indicate that.
0	‚ÄúHow does the vaccine combat the Influenza virus?‚Äù By killing people ....
1	I got the vaccine as a team effort for the world.
1	I got my two shots and they both went very well. I will get the booster shot too one day.
0	Vaccines are not necessary, our immune system can handle it.
1	I understand the need of vaccination and have been completely immunized. I am quite concerned about having a full viral load of coronavirus, which can kill you or make you very sick, with long-term health repercussions.
1	Well, there's the problem with anti-vaxxers right there: "I don't like being told what to do". This is the wilfulness of a child. I don't like being told what to do, either; but not to the extent of dying to prove my point.
1	The dying has become less than the #vaccination saved many people Why don't you #unvaccinated just let it be good. Nobody wants you to get #vaccinated . Stay unvaccinated, live with it, stop passing your fear of #Corona on to us I am healthy and #vaccinated
0	Aunt works at retirement home and everyone including staff has received both Pfizer shots and 2 weeks ago they had 10+ cases of covid... Grandma got thrombosis from the other covid vaccine. Friend is 20 named Alyssa went into convulsions after getting the Pfizer 8 days ago from me posting this comment. She is in ICU. Here in Ottawa there is 14 people total with covid in ICU. We have a population of over 1,408,000. CDC says we have more than 99.99% chance of survival from covid. I think I wont get vaccinated for this one.
0	I'll take my chances with the China virus before I put experimental drugs in my body.
1	I have a pre-existing health condition, so getting vaccinated was especially important for me.
0	I didn't trust those clowns from the start. I avoided getting the original shot and barely got out of the CG without repercussions since I was so close to my end of enlistment. If it kills me it's just my time.
0	Are they making fun of us with such lies ?? "everything is safe for you, but we will NEVER tell you, what's really in there" - yeah, makes perfect sense
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why  anyone would  give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually.
0	Not a chance I‚Äôll be taking it .
0	I will never have this corrupt vaccine from corrupt so called leaders AMEN
0	Finally asking questions after billions have been injected is really just despicable and everyone should be furious...Sadly we are a world of
0	I don't trust the vaccine because I heard it was developed using unethical means.
0	Vaccines? No. The woke poke isn‚Äôt a vaccine
0	the government needs to take responsibility and improve the vaccine safety process
1	Thanks Dr Seheult.¬† I think compliance would be a whole lot better if we implemented a baseline quantitative antibody level test.¬† If we could determine what the minimum immunity level would be based on scientific studies and used that as the "magic number" by which to recommend vaccination.
1	Nice article explaining ,how m RNA vaccine will work.
0	I love that all the vaxxed  now are saying  Why the heck did I do it It hasn't even been tested!!!
1	The vaccines are proven safe and reduce mortality from covid by 10 fold. Your case report is just that..... a case report. Please learn what what actual evidence is.
0	What scares me most about this is there is a No Liability Clause which means I cant sue them and recieve compensation for any damages that might be caused by this even up to death
1	I checked about this yesterday, and my bivalent booster was in September, the one for us "old people" over 65. So I am okay. Stay safe, people -- get the vaccine or your booster. Don't be stupid and uncaring. Thank you. ‚ù§
0	Vax is some form of trojan horse in the most general sense of the term. Could be genetic modification, weapon, source of second pandemic, hardware/software for Central banking digital currency, could be a lot of things but if they have to lie about what it really is and what it really does I wouldn't count on it being good.
1	I got my vaccine so I can finally travel and see my family
0	I now have blood cancer. Thanks Pfizer
0	I believe that vaccines are not the only way to protect against diseases.
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice... I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after.
1	I honestly feel bad for how misinformed you are about how vaccines work,mutagenic covid works, and how it relates to the human immune system. I could sit here and explain how your denial of the vaccine is the biggest cause of the problem, but ill save us both the time. stay safe
1	Anti-vaxxers have to be some of the dumbest, most illiterate people to walk the earth lol
1	Get vaxxed
1	I was hoping the more shots I got the faster it would happen.
0	End the lockdowns and restrictions üö´ üö´ üö´ üö´ üö´  say no to forced vaccinations üíâ üö´
0	The Pfizer shot is listed with 1291 side effects. That's insane!
1	COVID-19 vaccines does not interact with human DNA inside cells, and does not enter the cell nucleus where DNA is housed.
1	I tested positive for COVID-19 last week. I'm fully vaccinated with Sinovac. My Father tested positive too but he is not vaccinated yet. I saw the difference between a vaccinated person and unvaccinated person. Go out and take a vaccine. All vaccines are effective no matter what brand it is.
0	#DiedSuddenly #VaxxInjuries #VaxxComplicationsAreREAL #DoNOTGetTheSHOT
1	I will get my first dose this week!
1	Some would rather get seriously ill, and heaven forbid, worse, than believe what the gov't is telling them about the vaccines. Very sad :(
0	It is poison for every body
1	Well done Emily and pete on trying to help those who feel afraid of the vaccine feel safe. My 24 yr old daughter is in her first year of nursing and doing her 2nd stint of uni (super proud mum here) and her ward is a covid ward now. Luckily for our family she has had her first dose of the vaccine! No hesitations from her or us (we cannot wait for our turn) but thank you both for shedding light on this as some people are scared, hesitant......GREAT vlog üëç xxx
1	People believe what they want to believe and often perceive it as "the truth", even when we have presented the facts.  It can be dangerous when these false beliefs involve health issues and can spread this misinformation, which is why scientific facts are matter!! (and maybe some helping hand (slapping/reaching) is needed)
1	Vaccination is the right thing to do for the health of ourselves and our communities. Get vaccinated now!
1	#herdimmunity
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
0	Well RIP to those injecting this shit into their bloodstream
0	There hasn‚Äôt been a covid emergency in a long while at this point so I‚Äôm not sure what Biden is ending here
0	Think we need to rename the vaccine to deathjab
1	Thank you very much world health organization for giving us such a great information about the Corona virus vaccine and its side effects
0	Vaccine = death
0	My husband had a widow maker heart attack less than 2 days after his covid shot!!!!
0	38. "I got the vaccine and would encourage others to do the same."
1	Man I wish they didn‚Äôt turn me down for my second booster
0	Why are we required a vaccine when we have already had covid? You gain natural immunity by being infected
0	The creator of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, stated that the test was not to be used for infectious coronaviruses. He died a short time later. Then COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan. Yes, I suspect 'bogus' would be a good word for the test.
1	Never interrupt your enemy when they're making a mistake.
1	The shots saves lifes
1	To me a booster reminds me of doing drills for a disaster, or a skill recertification test. Like, "yeah I know we haven't had to deal with this recently but let's make sure you can still do it."
0	Anyone who gave these experimental injections to their healthy children, should be arrested for child abuse.
0	Pureblood and proud. I will never get jabbed, and will never trust the ‚Äúmedical world‚Äù again
0	Even on WHO-site it's stated that covid is less of an issue than a simple flu.
1	Worried about myocarditis? Get vaccinated.
0	All you people who think this shot is ok fine get it and good luck. But when young kids and athletes that are in excellent shape drop dead or have heart attacks like the caddy today at the golf tournament that‚Äôs just not normal. So for me and all my family it‚Äôs a big no‚Ä¶..
0	For me personally, I'm terrified of needles. I get panic attacks every time I get my blood drawn. One of the YouTubers I watch said she got the shot and immediately passed out from it. And she got the second shot and she is in a lot of pain. I don't feel like it's safe to use.
0	The military and NHS staff are on standby to roll out a Covid-19 vaccine across the UK from the start of December and will work ‚Äúseven days a week‚Äù, the Health Secretary has said.  No thanks.  https://t.co/fF70mTg6eP
0	It wasn't a coin flip mostly because the Vax didn't come out until a year after "2 weeks to flatten the curve". The storm had passed. We had already gone through the worst of it and it wasn't that bad. So the possible benefit of getting the Vax was low while the risk was completely unknown.
1	The impacts it can have on the elderly people is severe. Ask those groups to get protected with COVID-19 vaccines.
1	Really an entertaining topic that nurses and lower education medical workers have a way higher percentage of anti vaxxers than doctors and researchers. Even though nurses work together with their higher educated colleagues they ignore their knowledge and opinion on that matter.
0	This is a pandemic of the #vaccinated. A #virus has one job...To survive on its host. We keep vaccinating and this is creating variants. The virus is morphing to stay alive on the hosts. Never in history have we done mass vaccination on this scale. *Stop vaccinating.*
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
1	Whatever, give me all the boosters
1	All public employees should be required to get the vaccine or lose their jobs. This includes the military and police. No exceptions.
0	I would not take it during periods if possible. You are already under stress why add more stress. And there are rare cases where they had minor issues. Unless you have no other option better avoid taking during those days
1	Good work WHO. I had all my COVID-19 vaccines including the booster. No side effects.
0	My mom had two brain aneurisms after her shots and died soon after !!!
0	Wasn't there a recent study from the NIH that showed covid not causing myocarditis, but the vaccine causing an increased incident of it?
1	Like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects. However, the majority of side effects are mild and temporary, such as pain and redness at the injection site, or a headache. Serious side effects are extremely rare. And consider the alternative, the disease caused by the virus, which can be severe and even fatal.
1	Next up: "did people ever got sick before vaxxines were ever invented?"
0	We are hesitant due to the fact that I, and others have spread the word around that we are waiting until further symptoms may be shown later on. We KNOW, it may be safe, but we don't wanna risk it. Some of us have lost some good friends this year and it's honestly pressuring.
0	I can‚Äôt even frame a proper response to this idiocy; the world‚Äôs gone mad. Thank you, Dr. Campbell for your voice of reason!
1	Getting my second shot of Pfizer on April 14th! Only side effect was soreness in my arm. Off to visit my parents in May who have also both been vaccinated.
0	The COVAX is killing people
1	I battled cervical cancer for eight years. I had to have five surgical procedures. So much pain and suffering. Get the vaccine! Use condoms!
1	I hate seeing this. Covid doesn't care what age, race, gender, status in life or whatever. My heart goes out to anyone dealing with this. Well less so the Covid deniers, anti maskers and anti vaxxers. I do feel for their kids and loved ones. I unfortunately found out a person who I thought was at one time was a friend and hadn't seen or heard from in a while is a Covid denier.
0	Hardening or knots at the injection site were a side effect I experienced after getting the vaccine.
1	Bring unvaccinated is nothing to be proud of
0	No jab for my kids & I, ever. Hard pass on this human experimentation. And you mayyy suffer a yr later?? God help us..the experimentation on children too!
1	Stop rationalizing. The design of the ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù was not safe‚Äînot even in principle. And it failed on multiple counts, which was missed because the ‚Äútrials‚Äù were completely inadequate and perversely incentivized.
0	Del Bigtree exposes fraud in vaccines. Please watch and make up your own mind.
1	Vaccines work. Misinformation does not.
0	BIGGEST crime against humanity! Thank you for your courage and amazing drive to find answers.
1	I feel this coronavirus is an invisible enemy. I feel happy and safe because life is beautiful for me and I feel alive after I got vaccinated
1	Vaccines are a miracle of modern medicine and will help us defeat COVID-19.
1	Vaccinations are awesome
1	Take double boosters that will take care of you.
1	If your healthy, get the vaccine to lower the viral load when/if you get sick
1	Vaccination is the quickest path to returning to normal life and rebuilding society.
1	You absolutely did the right thing.This new technique for getting the vaccines (the mRNA instead of the inactive viral load) is already finding applications in the search for other viruses. It's a great thing
0	Does anyone knows who gives covid vaccine shot? And just not give it to u, just saline or inject it in the air? I had 2 already to keep my job but i cant keep getting this stupid vaccine & booster
1	Another day of watching a bunch of videos of people ‚Äúshaking uncontrollably‚Äù from ‚Äútaking the vaccine,‚Äù which is an affliction that conveniently only impacts White Republicans from the United States
0	The number of comments on here saying how it's all gone horribly wrong for someone they know or themselves is actually horrific. We must not forget what has been done to our loved ones. So glad I didn't participate in these test.
0	A headache was one of the side effects I experienced after getting the vaccine.
0	COVID-19 is a tool for Democrats to make you do as they say. I for one will not nor will I vaccinate #fuckvaccination #fuckyourfeelings
1	The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we can return to the activities and events we love. Get vaccinated and let's beat COVID-19!
0	I felt persistent weakness after getting the vaccine.
0	I told my friend to not get it and he just brushed off everything I said like it was crazy talk. He got vaxxed anyway "for work". His friend's mom died from the vax and now he's freaking out about it. Until it somehow personally effects them they will brush off everything people say as "conspiracy theories".
0	there is a microship in the vaccine
0	Everyone might push you to take the #Clotshot, but remember, this is a one way thing, you can't undo it, the government, doctor, nurse, are not liable for any injuries that you might get - and thousands are currently injured and some disabled :-(
0	Heart damage due to garbage mRNA vaccines obviously
0	The revolving door of Pfizer executives at the FDA says we might need to switch to annual shots so we can boost our stock portfolio
0	The week the vax became available I looked at relative vs absolute risk reduction. That was enough for me to make my decision
1	If you choose to risk your health and the health of the compromised in your community then don‚Äôt read posts about the vaccine. Many of us would like to make science informed decisions
1	Much safer than catching Covid. Much safer than allowing a virus 10 x more infectious than flu to run free in society. When you can find us some peer reviewed evidence proving your claim then maybe we will listen. I put you in the same bracket as the lunatic election deniers in the USA. Deluded
1	I've gotten my primary series plus 2 boosters. Do I need another booster?
1	Get vaccinated when available. It gives your natural immune system a head start.
0	Who knows what will happen to those poor who took the vaccine in the next few years. There‚Äôs rumours of blood clots and etc..   How come that they didn‚Äôt have any vaccines for Cancer and other illnesses and they managed to creat the COVID vaccine in a year!! THATS SUS GUYS
0	I'm a scientist myself. Don't wait around on science and mathematics to keep yourself safe. Science takes time. And in the meantime people are dying. Science also takes honesty. Unfortunately these days science has become corrupt just like everything else.
0	Why havent any of the pharma companies released their ACTUAL vaccine trial data? No independent doctors have been able to review actual results, we've been taking their word for it.
1	blood clots and myocarditides ARE more likely to happen to people who have gotten Covid. And far more likely to happen to people who have gotten Covid without a vaccine.
0	These 'vaccines' are infecting the idiots that have it. I watched a video of 3 eminent virologists, including the inventor of MRNA jabs, and they all warned against taking these jabs.
0	The vaccines are toxic
0	Vaccine is murder.
0	i rather Build my immune system,no thank you.
1	These COVID-19 Vaccines Are Safe and Effective‚ÄîWe Have No Safety Concerns
1	Tremendously excited to get my first dose today. #covid19 #CovidVaccine
1	Burying your head in the sand and going ‚ÄúI CAN‚ÄôT SEE IT LALALALALA‚Äù doesn‚Äôt change the fact that people are still getting sick.
1	Absolutely incredible work
0	How can even people not consider the effects this may bring in the future? We don't know what we put in our bodies.
1	I get first jab from Pfizer and feel excellent after that just as usual, second jab was from Moderna and I still feel sick 3 weeks after almost that I get cold and runny nose and headache and very weird condition! So please don‚Äôt tell me that is Moderna good !And I feel sorry because I accepted second jab of Moderna that worst experience ever !
0	Covid vaccine DOES. NOT. WORK.
0	I would decline a vaccine because there is no way any vaccine can improve your glutathione levels.
0	JUST. GET. VACCINATED.
0	actually, vaccinating is very very bad for your Kids. I read they can get the autism, do you think that is worth it???
0	I won't sacrifice my personal freedom for a vaccine that may not even protect me from getting sick. #NoMandates
0	People are dying from the vaccine but oh we'll never hear that
1	Young healthy people should still get vaxxed though, the vaxx will also reduce the chance the virus takes hold and has a chance to mutate.
1	Homemade remedies¬†and falsehoods are being shared widely on the Internet, as well as dismissals of expert advice.
1	I‚Äôve had all 5 jabs and I haven‚Äôt even had COVID so something must work
0	adults are skeptical of anything they tell us about covid vaccines so they're now going after the kids? They are desperate to keep the covid fear going. Midterms coming up...coincidence? I think not
0	New strategy huh? Are they gonna buddy up with pfizer, in their attempt to mutate the virus to more closely match the new cl√¥t shots? Evil.
0	After seeing all the vax injuries I‚Äôm more than grateful I didn‚Äôt take the jab either!
1	I got both doses last year. For the first shot, my arm was just sore for a day. The second dose was a little bit unpleasant. Had a slight fever and runny nose for a day, but after that I was alright again. Till now I haven‚Äôt gotten sick, so that‚Äôs good! Stay safe everyone!
0	Stay strong my non vaccers.. as far as the ones whom already received it, praying for you and please don't get anymore
1	Great video! Most of my family have had it and they're okay! A friend of mine told me the MMR is the reason I'm autistic.... I told him to do one
0	Floridas surgeon general is recommending against the vaccine for a lot of people now
1	Got my vaccine a couple days ago! Super big ups to all the people working on the roll out. Y'all are doing an amazing job, keep it up. If you need emotional support, msg me! Love you!
0	Not at all
0	Gentlemen, as our elected leaders, have YOU read the train-wreck of SERIOUS and Severe Side-effects?!
1	I'll take my vaccines, and my boosters thanks. If new vaccines come out for other infections I'll take those too. Just allopathic medicine things ya know Dr.
1	Excellent presentation. Saddened for all the lives lost to vaccine misinformation causing certain illness, and possible death. Any life lost unnecessarily is a loss for us all.
1	After 2 boosters, I'm absolutely thrilled that science prevailed.
1	I was against the vaccine but got it and aside from being tired for 2 days I'm fine. Never better.
0	So as long as they got covid sometime before they died the damage could be there regardless of when they were swabbed or vaccinated.
0	Another postion of propaganda! Keep your poison for yourself!
0	Woooooow this is the game changing moment Aaron always had strived for RIP....BIG WAKE UP CALL FINALLY!!! Thank you Aaron ‚ù§Ô∏èwe black people choose death over this vaccine
1	Getting vaccinated is a crucial step in protecting ourselves and others.
0	Anyone who injects children with this poison should be criminally charged.
0	I don't look down on your choice to be #vaccinated, please don't look down on mine to be #unvaccinated. Neither makes you a hero. #facts
0	If you got jabbed, please check your d-dimer & troponin levels by your doctor or cardiologist. Be on the safe side.
1	I think it's ok because when vaccine comes along, cuts that by 80%, so you‚Äôre getting 10 deaths per 10,000 cases.
1	I just got my first shot and my arm hurts like hell. But I'm gonna get 2nd shot cause getting COVID-19 would be way worse.
1	When do you expect to start the vaccine? When can we sign up for an appointment?
1	What I'm seeing is confirmation bias and chest thumping from Redditors
0	I had surgery yesterday. The nurses were surprised to see how well my "pure blud" came out when the drew some of it. It's almost like they have been seeing thicker samples that didn't draw so well. Stay natural my friends!
1	The COVID-19 vaccine gives us the chance to protect ourselves and others. Let's take it!
0	Where do you get the "90 to 94%" efficiency rates?  No vaccine ever has such a high rate of protection.  As these vaccines are in the experimental phases we can't make such assessments.  Heavily vaccinated countries show high rates of infection.  The only observable effects of the vaccines is a dampened down hospitalisation rate.  I think these figures have been manipulated by various agencies who benefit financially from the sale of these vaccines.
0	#Vaccine #Nationalism Makes a Deadly Disease Even Worse.
0	Those who get vaccinated don't get full immuniy either! Stop spreading lies!
1	Thank you to the medical and scientific community for protecting us against this awful virus.
1	Vaccines have been working for a long time
0	WOW A QUESTION ‚Ä¶. NOT AN UNFOUNDED ASSERTION ‚Ä¶. NOT BEING LABELLED‚Ä¶. If u must know.. COVID-19 vaccine-induced pneumonitis Type IV hypersensitivity against COVID-19 vaccine Happy .. and remember ur talking about a real human here.
0	"Safe and effective" is a marketing slogan.
0	Spot on! The point is, Fear fear fear, fear scares people in order to sale or take liquids... like vaccines..... üëç
1	I‚Äôve had Covid but due to the vaccine shots I didn‚Äôt have to be hospitalized in the hospital intensive care unit and hooked up to a ventilator to get oxygen into my system
0	I'm terrified for my friends and family that took the quadruple you know what.
0	Now it's time to go after #BigPharma ... #VaccineDeath #vaccinegenocide #vaccines
0	Died suddenly starting to show signs of shillery, you need to show people who die based on vaccination status at least, PEOPLE DIE. It happens alot
0	If you're #unvaccinated follow me!  If you're #vaccinated stay away, ya Donkey.  #escapethematrix #FreeTateBrothers #freeandrewtate  #FreeTristanTate #TheRealWorld

1	Cleared to get my 1st shot next week and Im excited!
1	Great, then inject me with it. If those anti-vax idiots don't want there's, I'll gladly take it in their place.
1	Getting vaccinated is a personal responsibility to protect not only ourselves, but also the people around us. Let's do our part to end this pandemic.
1	The lipids and spike protein dont stay in the injection site.
0	First I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôll get vaccinated. Now I know for sure I will not get vaccinated
1	People say ‚Äúwell what did people do before vaccines/antibiotics/pasteurisation?‚Äù as if that‚Äôs an argument for going natural.  They died, Carol. A lot of people died.
0	20."I think the COVID vaccine is the best way to protect the most vulnerable people in our society, like the elderly and people with pre-existing medical conditions."
1	No kid deserves this. Adults barely handle death well, and near death experience can cause enough trauma in adults... as a kid, you get that trauma and have to live with it for the rest of your life. That is a cruel existence and extremely upsetting and depressing. This crap needs to stop, and it is compounded by the fact that currently the only way to minimize infecting children is to wear masks, but of course the ones who are too self-centered and won't get the vaccine are literally the human equivalent of the rats in the Black Plague.
1	Got my booster this morning.... Feeling good!
0	I weep for my friends and family that took the you know what.
1	I have the covid vaccine and I'm not sick I'm still protecting from the virus
1	Vaccines have eradicated diseases that once killed millions, let's not go back to those times.
1	Chilean here. Our government is already offering annual Covid bivalent vaccines for risk groups and it's gone quite well. Adverse event rates for previous doses have been 0.03% of administered doses, with 90% of those being mild to moderate in severity.
0	Pfizer world population reducer. 50 percent by 2023.
0	I didn't want to take the vaccine but I was being forced to with my job. I'm a healthy young person barely gets sick and I worked as a healthcare provider in the Frontline during the pandemic worked on Covid floors and never once got sick. I took this vaccine yesterday (Johnson and Johnson) within an hour I noticed vaginal bleeding (my period came 8 days early) and within 6 hours I have a pounding headache and the chills. I haven't been sick in years and this is the worst I've felt in 5 years. I regret taking this damn vaccine and I do not recommend anyone taking this.
1	Vaccination helps us take care of ourselves and our families' health.
1	I have a family member like this guy, you could play the evidence in front of them & he will still defend stupidity at all cost
1	The vaccine is a global collaboration and a symbol of what we can achieve together.
1	ƒ∞f you want to protect yourself you shouldnt and cant vaccine me you should vaccine yourself
1	Being anti-vax is similar to smoking or using opioids recreationally . People know it might kill them but they do it anyway. I feel for the loved ones they leave behind.
1	Vaccination is literally the reason that we don‚Äôt have to worry about smallpox and polio
1	There is NO virus in any form in the vaccine! Head over to the CDC for the correct vaccine information.  Please pay attention to a particular fact listed there: those who've had covid and remain unvaxxed are *much* more likely to be infected again. should I not be concerned about intentionally causing more viral proteins to circulate in her blood Yes! So get your child vaxxed ASAP!
1	Modern vaccines are a gift from god.
0	Very great article! This is very true in my country our vaccine is not safe. Thanks for the article again.
0	@HereisWotIThink @simondolan ****"There are no or limited amount of data from the use of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2. Animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed"********"FertilityIt is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has an impact on fertility"****
0	It still amazes me how many people just will mindlessly put something in them that is experimental, and coerce others
0	You couldn't even pay me 1 million dollars to take the vaccine
1	Get vaccinated!!!
1	Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. If people love the Chinese vaccine so much, then let me give them the benefit of the doubt... But for me, I think that I'm 50-50 safe. By the way I was tested positive for covid-19 with fever, sore throat, extreme fatigue, and I'm fully vaccinated with the chinese vaccine...
0	I'm waiting to see how the vaccine impacts the population over time, I'm not going to be a guinea pig for the government or corporations
0	Just say NO it's all about the money
0	What‚Äôs sad is that these healthcare workers were praised and glorified (justifiably) during the height of the pandemic and now they‚Äôre being shut down for choosing not to get vaccinated.
1	Getting vaccinated for COVID-19 is crucial for the health and safety of not only yourself, but also those around you.
1	Vaccinate each child you would like to see graduate. You know what? Vaccinate them all for herd immunity.
1	I thought the same thing initially to - no way would I be first to get the vaccine...after almost a year of COVID, I'm SO ready for my shot! I want to be able to hug my dad again....and not worry about my mom. I want my daughter to get back to school b/c boy is she struggling w/ virtual life.
1	My husband and I have gotten the Moderna vaccines. We have not had any side effects except similar to an influenza vaccination. That is to be expected, as our body is taking in a foreign substance and it is just our immune systems responding as it should to fight a foreign substance. We have never had any COVID, nor do we have any long haul COVID symptoms, or any side effects. To us it was no different than taking an influenza vaccine.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	I am sorry but your statement just isn't true. How do you think people get Covid-19? They get it from unvaccinated people. And even today nearly 3 years later since Covid-19 was discovered. People are still getting. And they are getting it from people unvaccinated and unmasked! You don't have to believe me but it's true. Dead people in their Graves and in the hospital can attest to that. The CDC and hospital workers can verify that Covid-19 is spread by unvaccinated and un boostered people.
0	F you and your Vax!!!
0	Wondering if anyone can low key tell help others find a pharmacist who will ‚Äúgive‚Äù the nope nope ask for a friend
1	It's great to have vaccine,no side effects
1	Antivaxxers know their main argument is a losing one. This leads to them lying.
1	Do you want to love your neighbor? Get a vaccination.
0	At some point, if not already, the global death toll of the vaccine bioweapon will surpass the total for the Holocaust. Evidence for how this happened is now everywhere. Yet governments are still pushing the vaccine. This should have us all very seriously concerned for our lives.
0	I don't know anyone that refused the jab regret it, but I know a,lot of people that got the jab and regret it.
1	The vaccine makes you a less suitable host both more resistant to contracting/spreading it and far less likely to require hospitalization.
0	mRNA shots reprogram human cells to produce spike protein (same protein in the virus). These proteins can spread through the body causing inflammation and damage. Based on all the ppl with neurological damage they can also pass the blood brain barrier.
1	The three miracles of modern medicine are anesthesia (making surgery possible), antibiotics, and vaccines.
1	Done. So glad I was able to get mine as I am a caregiver for my 100 year old mom and 69 year old brother
1	Are you an immunologist? No? It‚Äôs no longer the year 1,000 CE, when a single person could understand all scientific knowledge known to man. Accept the words of people who have spent their lives studying the subject.
1	Doctor that studied 5+ years: hey this number is real Karen that just researched in Google: Noooo iT iSnT
1	I just lost my sister to Covid 2 weeks ago and she absolutely refused to get vaccinated or wear masks. Who knows who she got it from or who she spread it to. As soon as i could get the vaccine I got it. And I am glad I got it. On my sisters death bed she still believed the vaccine was bad for her. I spoke to her a few days before she passed. It was so sad.
1	I am proud to be vaccinated and boosted.
0	I'm done with vaccines
1	I'm 57 and had four shots of vaccine , no problem
1	Stop all the nonsense chatter. Vaccines work.
1	Getting vaccinated is a major contribution to reviving the economy.
0	Vaccines will do the job slowly and quietly. Hardly anyone will even know it's a holocause
0	Let's get all the politicians and the royal family vaccinated, see how they get on first!
0	I have 2 co-workers who were hospitalized with severe side effects from the vaccine.
1	I've had all my shots and didn't get sick in any way. That thing is just a quack!!
0	Oh that‚Äôs hilarious who would be dumb enough to get another shot.
1	Vaccines are highly effective.
1	To beat the virus, you need the vaccine. Get vaccinated now!
1	I was a bit anxious because I‚Äôll get the first Pfizer dose tomorrow! Thank you so much for shedding light on the topic dr.! Thank you and be safe!
0	I‚Äôve been vaxed but felt like I was forced to get it to keep working, kinda wish I didn‚Äôt get the shot at this point.
0	As concerning as vaccine injury might be, I feel like this same very concerned crowd were also the loudest voices saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a flu, calm down‚Äù
1	We're closer to everyone feeling safe. I can be around others soon.
0	Regular clinical trials take four to five years but these trials took a few months. What could possibly go wrong, go wrong... go wrong... go wrong... go wrong...
1	Symptoms were quite mild. Without vaccines and antivirals I might well be on a vent or dead right now. Current variants are more immune-evasive, but existing vaccines will keep you from getting seriously ill. Get your shots.
0	Still don‚Äôt regret not taking the vaccine.
0	And all the children and young adults already injured with 79 vaccines will be the Most injured!!
0	My neighbor died from a massive heart attack the day after she got the vaccine.  She was a healthy and active 58 year old woman with no prior heart condition.
0	This does not fit the narrative. They hoped he would lose. Another blow against his big pharma regime. WEF is collapsing , UN, WHO reputations are tarnished. They wanted a great reset, they got a great reject? The world is awakening and they can't stop it
1	Have you been stuck in a deep cave for the last two years? Vaccine helps prevent viral infections by helping your body to identify a virus quickly and prompt it into fighting the infection before it does any serious damage or kills.
1	Just got second Moderna, feel like I've got the flu for the last 24 hours or so. But better than Covid.
1	Anti-vaxxers need to be excluded from society if they aren't amenable to reason. They are holding public health hostage and will cause an even worse disease outbreak than COVID if left unchecked.
1	I'm from Vanuatu i got 3 vaccine shots
0	I‚Äôm not Vaxed and it feels so good I have naturally immunity everyone I know who got the jab has been sick. Over and over
0	No wonder why these vaccine companies are exempt from lawsuits. They knew they rushed this vaccine and said it will save the world. 2 + years later and we are still in this mess.
1	I'm glad you're talking about this because the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse gained a new member: Misinformation
1	Getting Covid is more dangerous for your health than getting the vaccine, even if the risk is low! These are FACTS. There is no "debate" to be had. Go jump off a bridge and debate gravity on the way down. Just cannot even with all these goofball biostatisticians who argue about Pfizer's data and then go and boof Ivermectin every day.
0	I will continue to pray for those under the spell of the media to be released so more lives can be spared. I know one too many deaths from vaccines.
1	130 out of 550,000 or so reported having a stroke in 3 weeks (NONE fatal), a small percentage of 1 %....none of which can be directly tied to anything. Guess what ? About 1/4 of everyone over 65 (137,000 +) will eventually have a stroke. Put half a million seniors together and you will see strokes, heart attacks, cancers, accidents , suicides etc over a certain time period.
0	More and more information about the venom injection is coming to light. Wonder when the crap really hits the fan and people start to realize what's going on and that the foil hats were right?
1	Vaccines don't cause strokes. Uncontrolled high blood pressure does though.
0	Got the shots a year ago. Got sick a lot. No period for a long time and then weird unstable cycle for months. I immediately regretted it, and even more so when I got covid. I've never been in favor of mandates and sure as hell didn't get my kids vaccinated. There are more people like me out here than you realize. Certain opinions just get amplified more than others.
0	The covid vaccine doesn't prevent infection, nor does it prevent transmission. So how in the hell did it save any lives at all.? Seriously.! Stop insulting our intelligence by saying it did.
0	For sure . I‚Äôm a welder . One of my sisters & husband once worked for Astra Zeneca, phds in neuroscience. They should have been the ones warning the family to wait and see what happens, but no they wen the full ‚Äòcult of covid‚Äô their 3 kids also . they must be worried now tho , probably on their 4 th dart by now .madness . I haven‚Äôt ha a sniffle in years..dart free
1	If you are still worried about microchips in vaccines, just know that your life isn't interesting enough to track.
1	accines are essential to end the pandemic, protect the vulnerable
0	33 year old niece has a hives type of rash since vaccinated. My brother has been hospitaled 2x's with heart issues. Diagnosis is early stage heart failure. He said he hadn't felt well since the vaccine. Mother died of sepsis 3 weeks after booster. No reason given for issues
1	The government definitely wants to kill all the taxpaying citizens.
0	The vaccines cause pericarditis, myocarditis, tachycardia, blood clots and reduce the effectiveness of the immune system by a third. Facts.
0	"Health officials have said this is safe." ?? That's a generalized statement. Not ALL health officials have said this is safe for all individuals. Logically, people are wise to question, weigh pros & cons accordingly, and make their best choice with fewest risks involved. That's only possible when the pros and cons are visible.
0	It‚Äôs reasonably simple to me - I can‚Äôt trust anyone who contradicts themselves. A change of mind is one thing a contradiction something very different and the narrative was riddled with contradictory advice and individuals.
1	Anti-VAXXers are like people who randomly sleep around without any protection. You can‚Äôt prevent STDs by taking vitamins, people. It‚Äôs not a difficult concept. Get the vaccine, wear a mask, social distance. Obviously
0	This is nonsense, the author should cite statistics like Covid deaths for children under 12, they are practically nonexistent. Besides that, it‚Äôs up to the parents, not the author and not the government to decide if their children will be inoculated or not, it really is just that simple. The fact that the government, and the New York Times, presses this issue so fervently gives me pause as it should other readers.
0	So you get a shot that increases risk of heart conditions which does not prevent you from getting the illness that also increases the risk of the same heart conditions. Hmmm; so why exactly do we need to get it again?
1	#COVID19 deaths in the U.S. continue to be undercounted. #GetVaccinated #ChooseToday !
1	Trump straight out admits he doesn‚Äôt know Silk at all ‚Ä¶. Then makes it clear he doesn‚Äôt know Diamond either. He‚Äôs at Diamond‚Äôs funeral to give a campaign speech while trying to garner some black votes. No more, no less. #GetVaccinated. Diamond died of #COVID19.
0	Vaccines can not be trusted
1	researchers achieved what they promised, mRNA shots already saved millions of lives
1	I got my COVID-19 vaccine and I feel relieved and proud to do my part in ending this pandemic. Let's all do our part and get vaccinated!
0	I'm terrified for my friends and family that took the triple you know what.
1	So everyone is freaking out about 6 people out of 7 million. Ok
1	You‚Äôre not gonna get COVID if you have these vaccines
0	The ones who ran to get jabbed, have gotten numerous shots & still line up for the next round, are sick & many will be gone soon. This is the biggest scam ever the world has ever known.
0	I didnt take it when it was free , why would I pay for a poison
1	i have a coughing can i get vaccine
1	I don't want to risk my child's health by relying on misinformation about vaccines.
0	The bad guys are winning, in part because health agencies either underestimate or deny the reach of anti-science forces, and are ill-equipped to counter it.
0	Pfizer, Moderna researching rare side effect linked to COVID vaccine
1	Let's vaccinate and protect our loved ones <3
0	A big profit making , controlling people scam from day one.
0	That means a third of the country aren‚Äôt confident they will take the vaccine ‚Äì though reasons vary from a minority of anti-vaxxers, to a larger group of people who are hesitant and want to wait and see if it‚Äôs safe, or think they are too low risk to need it.
0	I'm glad my family doctor said I didn't need the vaccine.
0	It‚Äôs not effective so what‚Äôs the point of taking it.
1	Wow! This is such great news, and makes me hopeful for a return to normalcy! Great news this week.
0	So grateful I didn‚Äôt get it! I want babies more than anything. I wonder if it‚Äôs also impacting sperm. I bet it is.
0	Well, I was waiting there for 6 hours and it shocked me how so many people were also there due to scary side effects after their covid jabs.
1	The positives of the vaccine greatly outweigh the negatives.
1	A scientist says that the vaccine that he knows a lot about is both proved safe and effective in clinical trials. And those trials are both open and transparent. He can even sometimes give you an on-line reference that gives the details.
0	Because of the Swine flu and narcolepsy
0	Ill be the one who never gets vaccinated
0	End vaccine requirements for employment. Never seen such fascism in this country
0	Pretty negligent pushing this at cancer patients when peer studies show the poison shot accelerates cancer!!!
1	Why would I get the shot? I can just drink some bleach and dish soap s/
1	99% of the ppl I work with & associate with are vaxxed. Wife & her Colleagues have 1000s of patients vaxxed. I know ppl who have died or become very sick from C19. None of us have heard of a single person having a serious reaction to the vax, let alone anyone who #DiedSuddendly.
1	I'm fully vaccinated cuz I'm not fully fucking stupid.
0	Got vaccinated from peer pressure. Ruined my life.
0	Before I get the vaccine, I would really want to know whether and how well vaccine manufacturers test their final vaccine products (‚Ä¶) and how much contamination they discover‚Äù
1	I took the vaccine because I'm not an F..ing numbskull. I took it because I like the idea of surviving Covid.
0	The protein Spike is in itself harmless" they must be joking!
1	Vaccine didn‚Äôt do shit to me compared to my Covid symptoms back in January. Get your vaccine, dummies.
1	Vaccines protect the world. Scientists, doctors, pharmacists, medical professionals deserve respect. You are real heroes. Thank you with all my heart. Companion, Cooperation, Development. Side by side together.
1	People from China will travel through Europe and come in to America from the east coast like they did when the pandemic started. This will do nothing if all travelers aboard aren‚Äôt made to test.
0	The pharmaceutical industry profits from sickness, and that's the industry that manufactures vaccines. Think about it.
0	Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, we need to handle the anti-vaxxers the right way.
0	I had the Pfizer vaccine & I was absolutely fine with them except for a sore arm at injection site. I had my booster jab which was also Pfizer last week & my arm was sore again but this time I suffered with a really bad headache for a couple of days after, head was pounding when I lifted my head off my pillow
1	This was my experience as well. I initially said I would wait at least one year before getting vaccinated, but my research led me down a different path and I get my second dose in five days. I'm grateful for science.
0	They just did a mayor trial on the World, and now the side effects are showing up. My body My choice.
0	I mean, what possible incentive would Pfizer have to lie about vaccine data, create preferable Covid strains, and pay off the media with huge ad budgets to silence any negative coverage?!  Just shutup and get your (profit) booster, peasants!
1	The sad thing about this video is that I took John‚Äôs words to heart. I have two elderly grandparents with comorbidities and both of my parents have comorbidities who all blatantly refuse to get the vaccine. I tried to convince then and was unable to. I got super close to convincing my grandparents and my mother talked them out of it. Then all four of them got Covid, my dad was hospitalized, my grandparents looked like they were about five minutes away from death, and my mother literally told me it is the worst she‚Äôs ever felt in her entire life. I had to watch all four of them be so sick and take care of them knowing it was preventable. I was the only one in my family that was well during this time because I got the vaccine. And yet despite the fact that I lived with my parents at the time, and I was spending a bunch of time with my grandparents taking care of them, I never got sick. Because I got a vaccine! Yet somehow that still wasn‚Äôt enough to convince them. Because after they were all better none of them got the shot. My parents think that having gotten covid means that they can‚Äôt get it again and even though I‚Äôve told them that‚Äôs not true they don‚Äôt care. It boggles my mind that no matter what I do they are so steadfast in their ridiculous dangerous decision. Watching this video again after all thats happened, listening to John plead To try to convince my family I‚Äôm just so sad. I tried and it wasn‚Äôt enough
0	Unfortunately when people try to warn you they called it misinformation some people lost their jobs
1	Now that the Great Drop Dead and Sterilization Event of 2022 didn‚Äôt happen, they need something to keep the grift going.
1	My dad is Serbian and he said go get it, so I did.
1	After 2 boosters, I'm absolutely thrilled that science prevailed.
1	Vaccines save children and their parents time and money.
0	Probably because it doesn't work.
0	I had persistent seizures after getting the vaccine.
0	Complete and utter propaganda. With a hand picked and paid "expert" lol.
0	I don't need it
0	The Covid 19 vaccines give you more severe myocarditis than the actual disease does. It is very real, and very dangerous.
1	What killed people before the vaccines
1	Anyways, moral of the story is, the vaccine works!
1	Getting vaccinated takes away the worry of becoming really sick, have the vaccine
1	Easily explained by sampling bias. These results are from Walgreens, their sampling technique was whoever walked into the store. There have been plenty of controlled, randomly sampled studies that show unvaccinated people have the highest positivity rate. If Walgreens corrected for sampling bias, its very likely they would show the same thing.
1	got my first pfizer dose today
0	as long as you only eat gummy vitamins you'll be safe!
1	The kids on TikTok have had enough LMAO! Get vaccinated . Get boosted. Don‚Äôt believe the dumb stuff.
1	voting is like getting a vaccine, it‚Äôs like. herd immunity from fascism. get a flu shot and for gods sake vote
1	I'm a vaccine advocate
0	The date of my last vaccination was......Still a pure blood and NO problems
1	I am very happy!! Get vaccinated, because vaccines work!!
0	Biggest scam in the world
0	don't believe the hype about the vaccine
0	The jab is like a box of chocolates, you never know which side effect you'll get - Pharma Gump.
0	@pinks0ph What book tho? I‚Äôve done my research. And on page 3 it stated that. Go to PAGE 1 and you‚Äôll see clearly it says ‚ÄúThe Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may not protect everyone‚Äù also check out that SECOND paragraph on PAGE 1, that says it MAY prevent.
1	Vaccines are the solution to ending this pandemic. Let's come together to protect ourselves and others. #VaccinesForAll
0	Yeah this is sus America! WAKE UP! The Covid Vaccine is Fake ...
0	As a general rule, I avoid over-reliance on medication. With covid, the accelerated speed of the vaccine development and the pressure applied to people to take the vaccine made me wary enough to rather take my chances with what the facts said was a relatively benign virus.
0	I am the only one at my work who said " No thank you" to get vaccinated. When I had it my immune system worked perfectly and after 4 days I was ready and went to work. :)
0	A BIOWEAPON MASQUERADING AS A 'VACCINE' - KAREN KINGSTON botshoot !!!
1	The best way to get rid of masks is to get a vaccine & I really wish people weren‚Äôt against both
1	Such knowledge,such information from people who couldn‚Äôt even tell you a thing about the process that keeps them alive ! If taking a vaccine worries them........they should look at the ingredients of a pot noodle !
1	My fiance's anti-vax dad passed away from covid last week. As much as I've loved watching strangers learn their lessons about not vaccinating it changed me when I watched it happen so close to home. People are falling for propaganda and dying, it's heart breaking.
1	Vaccines are not strictly necessary any more than a bike helmet or seatbelt is ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù when riding a bike or driving in a car. But if you want to reduce the chance of getting seriously injured when engaged in those activities, they are reasonable precautions. Vaccines are no different.
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
1	That's still way better than risking death or permanent damage from covid, though.
0	I know so many people who had serious side effects including a heart attack with a 28 year old with no pre existing conditions. Myself, I am still feeling strange a week after my first dose.
1	Its gonna be great watching the graphs of continued infections and when the vaccine hits seeing those rates start to fall. Then the real fun will start with the anti vaxxers doing everything they can to explain away why rates start to fall as soon as the vaxx hits.
1	Covid is not going anywhere and you can convince everyone to take the vaccine so the only thing you can do is take you vaccine wear your musk and live your life.
0	How about I just choose not to, that's my simple answer, no reason, no skepticism, I'm neither republican or democrat, I don't believe in or follow politics, I just don't want to get it
1	I took sinovac the only side effect I had was dizziness in my first shot for a few hours. On my second shot no side effects.
1	To all you Republicans - your supreme leader got vaccinated, and the only reason the vaccines rolled out at "warp speed" was because he requested it. Get vaccinated, dumbasses!
1	It's safe and effective for everyone aged 6 months and older to get their flu shot and #COVID19Vaccine at the same time. If you have questions or concerns, speak with your health care provider. Book an appointment at
0	People are still dying , also getting side effects from the jab, not worth it
1	I‚Äôm a nurse that works at a small community clinic. We‚Äôre starting to do walk-ins and I love it
0	The only thing the vax provides is a false sense of security and the increased risk of causing myocarditis, death, and/or a myriad of other injuries.
1	Anti vaxxers should be castrated and stopped from reproducing.
0	What is it with people who join an anti vax group to argue? Go Join the "im a guinea pig" group and talk with them
1	the vaccine prevents infection to some extent and for a duration of time. It reduces the risk of long COVID, and hospitalisation. Overall with current levels of COVID transmission, the benefit-risk is in favour of vaccines.
0	The govt changed the definition of the word vaccine late 2019 right before the hoax covid came up. They added a Part B to specifically say MRNA injections were vaccines. Otherwise, this poison death stab would be classified as a bioweapon which it is.
0	Please keep all of your records. Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt know the harm they could cause‚Äù
0	It takes years for side effects to appear, and they could very well be worse than the sickness.
1	Novavax is looking good these days.
0	mRNA is not a vax, never was. It's gene therapy. It changes one's immune system, altered through chemical reaction. It doesn't stop one from getting covid or spreading covid. Every governor, Senator, Congress person, Doctor knows that. And have known it for a long time.
1	Vaccines do not protect against death or infection with COVID-19. So, why do infection and mortality rates decrease as the proportion of the population that gets vaccinated increases? It's as if you know the solution but choose to ignore it.
1	Same with me got vaccinated by sinovac, got positive three weeks later. No symptoms only sneezing, thanks to sinovac
0	My heart breaks for the children that took this needless vaccine.
0	Is it likely to contain Mercury and other heavy metals? What‚Äôs the risk as with other vaccines of other complications
1	I will def cut off any friends that don‚Äôt vaccinate lol. Cause that‚Äôs me caring for the safety and well-being of my child
1	If you don‚Äôt trust science then don‚Äôt run to the people whose profession is based on science.
1	good. these rna vaccines are wonderful. we should figure out how to accelerate discovery, development, and distribution. make it work for all viruses.
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
1	Older coworker of mine has said he‚Äôs not getting vaccinated. This is after he‚Äôs had covid, also had 2 brothers in the hospital from covid side effects. He also smokes daily so he‚Äôs putting worse chemicals in his body than a vaccine. Makes no sense to me.
0	Was I the only person that pondered the fact that it was absolutely impossible to know the long term effects from this shot. Looking back, thank God I quit my job and found one that didn't mandate it.
0	I am willing to give up anything to stay a pure blood if they ever actually get a chance to jab me it will be my dead body
0	I wonder why people‚Äôs immune systems are so week now hmmm
0	"Today is my husband Howard birthday. He passed away on June 12th 2021 less than 24-hours after taking the covid vaccine"
1	All these trolling lightweights. Thank you Dr. Kate O'Brien for this important information.
0	So glad I didn't take the poison.
0	Watch out; Candace'll kill ya if you come at her kids with a vaccine.
0	Get your 20th booster I'm scared this might happen it's about to
0	The virus generally mutates to a more infectious but less deadly form. You really don‚Äôt need the vaccine. Besides, the cdc director just said that the virus is few mutations away from completely evading the vaccine.
1	The ‚Äústudy‚Äù that claimed vaccines cause autism is completely false. The anti-vaxxers‚Äô ‚Äúlogic‚Äù that they love throwing around is just proclaiming that they‚Äôd rather have a dead child than an autistic child.
1	Boosted 3 times. Never had COVID
0	In my opinion, if you had to be persuaded, lied to, incentivized, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt-tripped, threatened, punished and criminalized. If all of this was considered necessary to gain your compliance, you can be absolutely certain that what was being promoted was not in your best interest.
0	Fake News... Vaccines have a huge impact on healthy individuals. You will increase your risk to adverse reactions or even death if you take the Covid 19 Vaccine.
0	Enhanced Risk of Infection and Damage: ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ so these vaccine side effects, serious adverse events and death, they can‚Äôt be understated‚Äù - Dr. Peter McCullough.
1	What we really need is a variant that kills 98% of the antivaxxers, and spares 98% of the vaxxed. THEN the pandemic will be over.
1	I like that! Also we need to check vaccination cards. I don‚Äôt want to be anyplace the anti mask/vaccine AH are ever.
0	I will never trust the medical establishment EVER again in my life
0	I had a bruise or bleed at the injection site after getting the vaccine.
1	Anti vaccine kids: dies from sickness Anti vaccine mom: those dang video games
1	I use intelligence, open-mindedness, and will to get me closer to the truth. And all of these prove vaccines are safe!
0	I was at football training the other day and the coach said to me that the other instructor collapsed with a blood clot, yet nobody in the group stated the obvious, because I did
1	Vaccines are necessary to protect vulnerable members of society.
0	It is unavoidable that the anti-vaccine movement would exploit this to sow fear and uncertainty. But they've gone above and beyond.
1	I got the Moderna vaccine.
1	Oh I‚Äôm very fucking angry. I work as a night shift medical lab technologist (in fucking Florida lol) and the amount of positive covid tests I‚Äôve had and the amount of convalescent plasma I‚Äôve had to give out this past month is infuriating.  I‚Äôm worn thin and losing my sanity because of these morons
0	Gives you a permanent and irreversible heart condition like a boss
0	My dad suffered a seizure 2 months after 3rd shot. Suffered 10 days in hospital n passed.  It's been 7 months. My brain still can't comprehend any of it. I have so much hate for them mandating the vaccine. Prayers to all
1	By all means, do your research and come to your own conclusions. But if you reach the conclusion that vaccines are bad for you and should be avoided, you probably fucked that up.
0	The covid vaccine has been tied to cases of blood clots and myocarditis in a lot of people. It was rushed, never safe, and completely unnecessary.
1	The natural immunity to covid has actually been found to be fairly limited, ie you can catch it again. Two doses of vaccination has been shown to give you much better immunity than contracting the full blown thing.
0	New technology is new, and we won‚Äôt know for decades what the consequences, of any, of its use will be.
0	What's the point of getting the shots? They aren't very effective. They don't prevent you from catching COVID.
0	I believe that there are safer and more natural ways to protect against disease.
1	In the US, the focus takes the form of an issue-specific campaign that has arisen from existing pro-vaccine parent blogs and discussion groups pushing for policy change rather than public confrontation.
1	These are the same people that complain that everyone is a pussy these days.  Used to play sports with no pads, Playgrounds used to be metal, No adult supervision, Corporal punishment, Peanuts everywhere, Ect. Ect. Ect.  Now they can‚Äôt even stand a shot they give toddlers
1	Great video. I loved how you approached each concern so calmly and respectfully. What I love most is your message to treat the anti-vaxxers with respect, to not alienate them, and to hear them out. It saddens me a bit to see so many in this comment section miss that part, and instead opt for making fun of the people in the video.
0	Don't blindly accept the vaccine just because everyone else is doing it
1	And then the deaths turned from cities to overwhelmingly rural and Republican voters once the initial stages were over and especially once the vaccine was created.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is our best chance to defeat this pandemic. Don't hesitate, get vaccinated today.
0	What‚Äôs wrong with waiting a little bit to see the effects of this new vaccine? Nothing wrong with doing some due diligence first
0	So worried about my vaccinated family members‚Ä¶. But they‚Äôre to stupid to think for themselves and keep getting the jab. #VaccineSideEffects #VaccineDeath #VaccineMandates #vaccinated
0	I've never seen so much lying and deception surrounding any one particular topic before this one, in my entire life.
1	If you are vaccinated you cannot contract the infection and pass on to those unfortunate enough to not be able to vaccinated.
1	My dad died because he didn't get vaxxed
1	Covid is now endemic and no longer a pandemic. Like the flu and pneumonia are. My advice: continue masking, get your vaccine and manage your interactions according to your risk/comfort level. Don‚Äôt expect others to bend to your limits and berate them when they don‚Äôt.
1	I will take a vaccine that has passed review and clinical trials for safety and efficacy. I care not where it was made or about the ethnicity of the people who made it, so long as it has been demonstrated safe and effective.
0	Waiting impatiently to die from the vaccine
0	if vaccine is so safe why do you still need to sign a form to show voluntary consent...............
1	It is because of people like this woman that the US has such a low take up of the vaccine. Well more fool them. Let this doctor be made responsible.
0	I bet the mother isn‚Äôt too happy about shilling the vaxxxx now‚Ä¶
0	I don't want the govenment to control me
1	Same as previous poster, vaxxed, boosted, still caught it twice after. I'm so glad I was vaxxed and boosted bc I'm pretty sure it would've landed me in the hospital or the obituaries. Got boosted again recently. Felt like crap for 3 days, but 100% better than getting COVID.
1	Someone needs to tell her that this is what's actually happening, the vaccinated are almost all being sent home because we don't need intensive care.
1	Can‚Äôt wait to get it. I‚Äôm currently super sick with Covid and in quarantine. Never want this shit again.
0	With every passing day, I'm happier that I rejected the vaccine. Especially after I caught covid and it was the mildest cold I ever had
1	Vaccinated twice and had a booster! Feeling great‚Ä¶hope it works on any new variants like omicron
0	Look we had two get the shot at our long term care home that had adverse reactions. One ended up intubated had seizures back to back. Ended up with epilepsy. The other now has schizophrenia and is on her third hospitalization since the vaccine, yet medical records don't indicate a connection. Doctors refuse to write they think there's a connection because it happened a couple weeks after their second shot. It's the shot, we know it's the shot, but they'll cover these up as long as they can till everyone's had a shot. Then months down the road their headaches start , they get psychiatric disorders, and neurological conditions?? No one knows. That's why we should have respected the process and not rushed science.
1	People need to educate themselves on common medical knowledge before ranting on social media and making theirselves look like an idiot #provaccination
1	When that person with the vax scar on their deltoid tells you about how vaccines are bad...
0	THE PROTECTED NEED TO BE PROTECTED FROM THE UNPROTECTED BY FORCING THE UNPROTECTED TO USE PROTECTION THAT DIDN‚ÄôT PROTECT THE PROTECTED .. ok I think I got it now.
0	What is the best way to fight back and win? We didn‚Äôt have sufficient will as a population and 2/3s of us laid down and let them inject poison into our arms. We didn‚Äôt stop it! How will we win next time?
0	‚ÄúCovid‚Äù Or do you mean side effect from the Con vaccine
1	While I wasn't doubting the vaccine, this cleared up my confusion on the differences between the vaccines. I really appreciate this video. We're almost there!
0	how can government agencies legally force these chemicals on us without us having a say in it...absolutely fucking sick
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a shining example of what we can accomplish when we work together towards a common goal.
1	Speak for yourself, I plan to take the shot.
0	We all know it‚Äôs the Jabby. And these evil people push for it still‚Ä¶ crazy
1	Can we just take a moment and appreciate the vaccine?
1	I am 100% PRO vaccination. Because vaccines prevented me and my kids from diseases such as polio, tetanus, yellow fever etc.
0	There has to be an accounting. These liars have to be held responsible for the deaths and injuries of those who trusted them and for the ruining of lives of those who did not. This must be dealt with or they will do it to us again until we are in chains.
0	Covid was never out there ‚Ä¶ the flu / cold was! The bio weapon is the shot so no need for that mask. I promise it useless!
0	This was never about public safety it was about control.
1	SO true. My 9 year old niece's mother refuses to get her vaccinated. I feel completely helpless because my partner is immunocompromised and I am the caregiver for a 87 year old with dementia who is also immunocompromised. Our doctor says its not safe for them to be indoors with unvaccinated people so I havent gotten to see my niece indoors in 2 years. Sucks because the anti-vaxx mom is the custodial parent. Need to pay $5,000 to get a lawyer to challenge it. Shit sucks.
0	Poor...  They have cheated the world on covid vaccine.   It is useless
1	Got my first vaccine (Pfizer) ! 3 weeks to wait for the second one. Finally - no more worries...
1	The solution here has to be for eveyone to be vaccinated
0	Data from Ed Dowd suggests +7% increase in mortality per jab.  So 2 jabs + booster= 21% increase risk of death, etc.
0	vaccines may not be effective against new variants of the virus.
1	I am for vaccination but it's shameful that the companies stopped improving the vaccine against the delta variant in favor of milking the golden cow with antivirals for hardest cases and booster shots that delta made half efficient, governments should condition the use of boosters with limits on vaccine margins and improved efficacy, Pfizer and Moderna should make the vaccines way cheaper, and take an example from AstraZeneca, which is pricing its vaccine on the level of the production costs
1	I am the same Dr Mike. I am vaccinated so are my children and I look at it as a if I had a reaction that doesn't mean my kids will or anyone else is. I have seen what happens to people who are immune compromised and they get a vaccine preventable illness irs horrendous and preventable.
1	I remember years ago being told to only use logic, facts, no emotion. I am not a doctor, only telling what I learned in school.
0	As of last night, I know personally of 18 people who have covid. Only 2 of them were not vaccinated. Make of that what you will
0	That is what our immune systems are for.
0	However, a fifth of the U.S. population is already threatening to do just that, and it's increasingly clear that COVID-19 conspiracy theorists are teaming up with anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists as part of a rapidly expanding movement that aims to wage a full-scale information war against vaccines.
0	Whats more disturbing to me is why people would expect someone NOT to be hesistant about putting something in their body.
0	Did not get the vax and neither did my 6 children. No regrets. Happy that I didn‚Äôt cave to pressure
0	I truly feel for those who allowed themselves to be convinced or leveraged into taking the vaccine. I hope one day there will be justice.
0	We will never be fully vaccinated Covid-19
1	because of taking the vaccine i can finally travel to the USA
0	I hope anyone that has taken the jap dies before infecting us.
0	No even had my first one yet!
0	I. Will. Not. Comply.
1	Before I got my vaccine, I got sick with covid. My dad already had his shot. We were in close contact. He didn't get sick. At all.
0	Who was he trying to kid. the truth is they are not safe.. far from it. all the way to the grave
1	Bottom line ‚Äî get the booster everyone. Boost BEFORE the upcoming holidays please.
0	Natural immunity is the best.
0	When the CEO of  wont even take the vaccine....how are you guys still this blind?
1	The vaccine gives us control over our health and a sense of empowerment.
0	No I wont be getting the vaccine. Many good points made here I will try to keep it brief.
0	"If you have to be persuaded, reminded, bullied, pressured, bribed, incentivized, lied to, guilt tripped, coerced, socially shamed, cencored, threatened, paid, punished and criminalized, to gain your compliance... You can be absolutely certain what is being promoted is NOT in yours or our best interest!
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer
0	why I need a vaccine if I am still alive? it's been 2 years of covid-19.
1	Remove your antivax garbage from my site.
1	Vaccines are a vital tool in preventing the spread of disease. Get your COVID-19 vaccine and help protect yourself and those around you.
0	You really believe that, COVID restrictions don‚Äôt work, the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work and is dangerous, people aren‚Äôt dropping dead, we live free from that garbage and love it! Wake up and get your facts straight!
0	High number of vaccines = increased toxic chemical additives in our children = more reactions
1	Well, she may yet be right.  In which case the anti-vaxxers can have the last laugh.  But in the meantime, I'm glad deaths from covid are lower.
1	They weren‚Äôt exaggerating when they said what the side effects are going to be. Have a 38.6 fever RN, had chills last night, and my arm hurts. BUT, I am grateful
0	The vaccine didn't even pass phase 3 trials
0	We're talking about HUMAN LIVES here! Let's not repeat the mistake of the past!  jeopardized many lives
0	Fuck the vaccine, the hell with it!
0	Using a term like ‚Äúanti-vax‚Äù so weakens any actual point you might make. I‚Äôm pro-vaccine.  I‚Äôm vaccinated.  My kids are vaccinated.  None of us have had covid shots because the shots are not vaccines.  I‚Äôm not anti-surgery because I don‚Äôt want a lobotomy. Be better.
0	My friend had the Oxford jab and by the next day he was paralysed in hospital for 2 days, he still isn't right either and he said he  won't  have the 2nd jab. And I spoke to another friend last night who had it 2 weeks ago and he's been having horrendous  headaches since.
0	When the truth comes out, you can‚Äôt unvaccinate yourself.
1	Of course there are vaccines that are effective and safe
0	My father died 9 days after receiving the shot. It is not safe in my eyes. Something needs to be done!
0	Q: Who should not take the covid-19 vaccine? A: All living things.
0	How is that man not taken to prison on the spot?
0	My immune system is 99.4% effective‚Ä¶
1	Simple, effective, and evidence based. Unfortunately antivaxers are working hard to make things worse.
1	Vaccination is the light at the end of the tunnel for ending this pandemic.
0	Please stop offering Pfizer vaccine. Don't be vaccinated
0	I‚Äôve lost friends because they wouldn‚Äôt fucking stop talking about it and telling me I should get the jab. I don‚Äôt bring it up, they do. It‚Äôs like a fucking religion and they can‚Äôt stand anyone who won‚Äôt comply.
1	In conclusion, according to the scientific knowledge, we are aware that the COVID-19 vaccines represent very efficient products with a favorable benefit‚Äìrisk ratio.
1	Parts of the US have also reported outbreaks, with¬†after a severe outbreak.
0	vaccines cause autism
1	Calling people stupid and belittling them is100% the correct way to ensure they will NOT change their mind about getting the vaccine
0	I‚Äôm not vaccinating because it‚Äôs unproven. Understand that it should alleviate symptoms but 93+% of mortality rates are due to existing conditions and older ages. There are medical reports of people receiving the vaccinations who have developed neurological issues. There is no precedence whatsoever for this drug and my child will absolutely NOT get it. Bottom line, you do you. For you people who are pointing fingers telling people to get vaccinated, piss off and get a life. Whether you get vaccinated or not has no affect on anybody else.
1	Vaccines have been studied and are known to be safe-ish
1	As of today, all 27 MS expressed support for our common EU vaccines approach.
1	Y'know I'm glad there are doctors taking the time to educate people about the vaccine
1	Riiiight. What about the vaccinated people dying of covid 2 to 5 times less than the vaccinated? Coincidence?
1	To think he could have just gotten vaccinated
1	You have the freedom to do a lot of things. Like Dying from a preventable diseases. A bunch of pussies who are afraid of needle. Like a 2 year old.
0	Me or nobody in my family ever had covid. We also did not get any vaccine or boosters. We did not wear any masks or gloves and went everywhere as usual.  Still got all my DNA intact. I prefer to keep it that way. Each to his/her own.
0	I got vaccinated and now I'm suffering the consequences, I wish I hadn't been vaccinated
0	Spreading EVIL well
1	I am glad that my family and I got our vaccines! We did not experience any side affects either! üëç
1	Why the fuck am I still seeing fake seizure videos? The imbeciles posting them & claiming they were caused by the covid vaccine has very likely never taken a single covid vaccine.
0	Hundreds of athletes and public figures dying and collapsing complication  #SuddenlyCollapsed #DiedSuddendly #VaccineDeaths
1	Because the vaccine is not dangerous and doesn't cause heart problems, you fucking dunce.
0	"Experts"? I call them terrorists who should be in prison at best.
1	I'm the same age as Philly, and I got vaxxed as soon as possible. March/April 2021 were my first two doses, and in Mid-December 2021 I caught Covid. Shrugged it off like a mild cold, and just got my booster yesterday. Also, I have a lot more comorbidities than Philly seemed to. Get the shots.
1	You can't fix stupid. Even if you could, the anti-vaxxers are next level stupid.
0	vaccine may not offer moderate disease protection from the  suggest prelimi
0	I am also unvaccinated and plan to stay this way. But of all these vaccine injury videos I‚Äôve watched I don‚Äôt know of anybody in my major city who has had an adverse effect..but I still don‚Äôt want to take that small chance
0	Getting vaccinated is a crucial step toward returning to a sense of normalcy. Let's do what we can to protect ourselves and others.
0	Why did Anthony Fauci tell our government to tell coroners, to not do autopsies on Covid patients???
0	Its actions require our attention, and we must be ready to respond.
1	Hopefully will make people feel more trusting of the scientific community:)
0	I am 68 years old, not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy. In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a so happy we did.
1	Because some people think protecting their health is important and they passed their junior high school science classes so they know how vaccines work.
0	Anyone believe this WHO bunch anymore???
1	it's important to make an informed decision. But I hope you'll consider the lives that can be saved by getting vaccinated.
0	Nothing says 'Trust The Science" quite like "You can't sue us if something goes wrong" and "We need 55 years to release the data to the public"
1	In terms of the interactions generated in each network, it was discovered that the pro-vaccination network generated 979,418 interactions, of which 42,135 (4.3%) corresponded to bots, with a ratio of interactions to messages in this network of 136.6.
0	there was never a need for a first shot, that people still believe them with all the other shots is an absolute joke
0	@SpeakerPelosi If vaccines work to cure the coronavirus and 100% safe like other Vax's then why isn't the seasonal flu cured linked to the CV and why did Congress grant Big Pharma immunity from direct adverse health effects? https://t.co/jVw8050U82
0	#Pfizer admitting that #COVID19vaccine #shedding is #real
0	Negative side effects are not rare!
0	In the light of current theoretical discussion of 'scientific citizenship' this paper argues that identifying anti-vaccination groups with other social movements may ultimately have the opposite effect to that intended.
1	I'm so tired of people saying the vaccine have horrible side effects. I got vaccinated and now I'm still alive and have to go to work.
1	The number of people experiencing self-reported long COVID in the UK continues to decline. The January number is now about 15% less than the peak recorded in August-September 2022.
1	Good to know that there's no drop in effectiveness even after six months. Hopefully that will protect us over the fall and winter.
1	It‚Äôs been over a week since I‚Äôve been vaccinated and I‚Äôm feeling strong!
0	Hey guys been threatened with my job in Queensland Australia today. I need a fake covid certificate asap . does anyone know where I can get one? you would be saving my ass
0	We are the control group they never wanted.
1	I got my vaccines as soon as they were available. I have had 3 and feel fine. I really hope others will protect themselves and their families and friends from this disease.
1	time for winter covid vaccinating and iv been lucky enough to be part of the team again! I feel privileged.
0	Dear fellow purebloods. Stay strong
1	I'm 74. I do not have underlying conditions. I am relatively healthy. I opted to get my 2nd booster. Can't hurt and it just may save my life one day. I don't understand why people have to think twice about it. Just do it!
0	I never got vaccinated. Caught covid once. Headache, congestion. Symptoms went away within 7 days
1	Just got my third shot! Boost me up!!!!
0	When I was dieing in the hospital with it. Was perfectly healthy before Covid. A little bit of advice. If you get hopitalized with it and you are a Trump supporter, that's when the gith of your life starts. Thank God I had family with me 24/7 or I wouldn't have made it
0	There is no way Im taking that vaccine.
1	The COVID19 vaccine is safe, effective, and it saves lives. Don't wait. Help protect our communities. Get vaccinated.
0	Except you are more likely to get COVID if you are vaccinated.
0	I've thought the same thing. But all my vaxxed family don't pressure me into getting it. I think that the vaccines are doing something to people tho... they act subtle different..
0	Do you remember those pro vaccine stating the un vaccinated had to get vaccinated so the vaccinated would not get Covid? Fucking real idiots attempting to get you vaccinated so you will die and depopulate the earth
1	No participation without vaccination. We must eradicate covid like we eradicated smallpox/ polio etc. Step up gov. Lead like you done throughout the pandemic before our hospitals are full of covid patients.
0	Omg totally fucking brainwashed. I live in Mexico and the rona is going around here recently where I am but I can‚Äôt help but notice that it‚Äôs ONLY VACCINATED PEOPLE who are getting sick. Don‚Äôt let anybody make you feel bad for the choices you make for your body!! You are now living proof you don‚Äôt need to poison yourself for ‚Äúprotection‚Äù... it doesn‚Äôt work anyways.
0	Don't push it on people who don't want poison thier bodies
1	It's important to trust in the science and the medical community when it comes to the coronavirus vaccine. Leading health organizations, including the World Health Organization, have endorsed the safety and efficacy of these vaccines
1	You are very selective with your data.  You forgot to say that the data shows that the vaccine works and saves lives, and reduces the risk of serious disease
1	i cant wait to hug my friend again
0	If they had asked, I would have gladly told then where I was and what they could do with the "vaccine."
0	I never got the vaccine or have had Covid and I work in healthcare!  I‚Äôve seen lots of new cancer cases since the vaccine!
0	They are not safe and my friends wife is proof. After her second shot. Her kidneys were shutting down. She had a bad reaction to the shot and was in the icu because of it. Be careful people. Main stream media isn't telling the whole story.
0	Im proud to be unvaccinated.
0	I don't want to subject my child to potential side effects from vaccines.
1	I have faith in the science and the experts who have confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccine is both safe and effective.
0	That mom who was for vaccines seemed extremely gullible.‚ÄúTrust that other people know what theyre doing‚Äù.With your childs life? Stop it
1	My kiddo got the shot an hour after the CDC Director‚Äôs ok. I drew it up. Hubby gave it. Evan wore the ‚Äúnot throwing away my shot‚Äù shirt.
1	Is it time to get your COVID-19 bivalent booster? It is the best option for protecting yourself and others from #COVID-19. View the 1-minute #COVID Boosters video: https://t.co/zk1VkKzCXQ  #Vaccinated #HealthyNewYear https://t.co/LORr9HDZu8
0	I seem to remember the tobacco companies investigating whether cigarettes caused cancer.
1	I guess I need to say it again. Vaccines do NOT cause autism. Definitive. No question.
0	No Covid jabs here. I don't care if you take the jab or not, just leave me and my family alone.
0	No long term safety data availble, no vaccine for me.
1	Wind your anti vax neck in. You only alive today because of vaccines in the past TB, small pox or polio would of taken your grandparents life away.
1	why you believe this study and not the meta analyses that demonstrate the covid vaccines are safe and effective?
1	Herd immunity is crucial for ending the pandemic. Let's roll up our sleeves and get vaccinated!
1	im sosososososo sick of all this antivaxx shit now man it's so insanely fabricated
0	Fauci created the COVID 19 virus .. he own moderna anc thencovid vaccine pat. His wife works for FDA it's a slam dunk for the fauci family they are mass murderers.
1	I wish they would have allowed a second booster. My third shot was in November, and I just tested positive today. Managed to avoid it for over two years.
0	100% pro-vaccine, 100% anti-vaccine mandates.  I personally do not plan on taking the vaccine however, I understand why people do/don't.
0	Bahahahaha! That and more susceptibility to strokes. Glad I took the vaccine. NOT.
1	17. "I'm concerned about the fast development of the vaccine, it feels rushed."
1	Me after getting vaccinated:  chills, fever, body ache are actually a good thing, you did it man!
0	How about that, get the Vaccine or get cut and lose your NFL Job. Comply and obey them.
0	As a medical doctor, I can confirm that we are seeing a lot of strange illnesses in people after taking the jab.
0	"it's perfectly normal for children to die for no reason"
0	Uh... No thanks.. I want to live..
1	Pro-vaxxers believe certain vaccines are unsafe, with their chief worry appearing to be that the MMR vaccine causes autism, a claim which stems from research by British former doctor Andrew Wakefield in the late 1990s, which drew a link between the two.
0	A video of the President getting his booster does not motivate me to get mine. I have not been the same since I gone the shots and 1 booster
1	I'm so grateful for these videos. They're well explained and talk through each point with evidence and clear examples. These videos on COVID and vaccines are very helpful and much appreciated ‚Äî when I noticed vaccine hesitancy in people around me (because misinformation and conspiracy theories are everywhere these days), I shared your video "Inside the Lab That Invented the COVID-19 Vaccine" with them, which was very helpful in explaining mRNA vaccines and how they work. I'll definitely be sharing this video in the days to come too.
1	Just ask an antivaxxer for peer reviewed evidence. They spin like flies with their legs in the air. Or go silent and name call. Such predictable sheep no brains. Baaaaaa baaaaa
0	"The American Heart Association has published a new study which has found that 98% of all cases of Myocarditis among children are due to the mRNA Covid-19 injections."
1	Yep. It‚Äôs outrageous how much antivaxxers and the, ‚Äúhealth food,‚Äù industry make off selling their various lies, nostrums and quackeries.
1	This study from the Yale School of Public Health found that, before the vaccines were released, the excess death rate for Republicans was about 22% more than the rate for Democrats, which is understandable given the demographic differences between the parties (Republicans tend to be older) but after the vaccine was released, the Republican excess death rate jumped up to 153% higher than Democrats.
1	I would love to see an update on this with what is known now :) (3x vaxxed, waiting for 3-5yo)
0	Maybe it's just supposed to get rid of old people.
1	"Don't believe the anti-vaxxers. covid-19 vax have been thoroughly tested & are safe
1	It‚Äôs simple. Go pick any state or locality. Download their COVID case data and death data from each day since March 1, 2020. Download the daily vaccination data. Graph the two over time on the same graph. Typically around the time that the population gets above 5 - 10% of the population fully vaccinated, you start to see a steady decrease in cases, hospitalizations and deaths which pushed back the virus. This goes through the early summer of 2021 when we do start to see the flattening of the vaccination curve and the increase in cases, likely due to the high transmissibility of the delta variant. But you also should see that the number of hospitalizations never gets back to the highest levels that corresponded to high cases from pre-vaccination period.
1	Getting vaccinated is a positive step towards returning to normal life and putting an end to the pandemic.
0	my autoimmune disease is completely out of control after the pfizer shot. thank you for no protection and all the pain!
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
1	Yes. This isn‚Äôt newly found data, it‚Äôs been fact for a long time. Getting the vaccine protects YOU, no one else.
0	Why would you suggest that kids get the primary series of shots? It‚Äôs clear now that the dangers outweigh the benefits!
0	every day look more and more heart attacks for young healthy people some of them totally in shape.
1	‚ÄúI‚Äôm just honored to be one of the first getting vaccinated. Protect yourself and protect your loved ones by gettin‚Ä¶ https://t.co/UxM0ZtAxPl
1	It‚Äôs been such a long year. Thinking about going out in public without a mask, sitting in a restaurant without a mask, taking the train, going to the gym...all these things I haven‚Äôt done in months. I took too many things for granted.
0	What if I told you that the government gave out the vaccine for free to keep the general public sick and afraid?
1	I just booked my next vaccine shot, SO excited
1	We are not safe until we are all fully vaccinated against COVID-19
0	This is fake, grifting to make $$$
0	I am also unvaccinated and plan to stay this way.
0	Short time were here on this earth compared to heaven or hell. That phizer guy + whoever else pushing this poison on us will forever burn in hell where they belong. Can't wait. WAKE UP AMERICA!!
1	Vaccines rock n keep us alive.
1	I don't believe in the science behind the COVID vaccine. I think it's a hoax.
1	Someone asked me why I received the shots and  I‚Äôm wearing a mask. I just said it‚Äôs for courtesy. I values other peoples‚Äô lives more than any ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù I have in my choice. My choice is to protect.
1	After I got my vaccines, I had terrible side-effects. Painful headaches, body soreness, and fatigue. Basically they made a whole day for me miserable. But it was for a good reason.
0	Vaccine the biggest regret of my life so far
1	I trust in science one of the most important thing in my job as biologist. I'm vaccinated.
0	I think we are going to find that the Covid vaccine, especially the MRNA variety, will have serious future affects on our health and immune systems. I think we are going to be dealing with a big mess. We must be careful not to judge each other too harshly. I believe most people felt they were doing the right thing. With more information and study we will have the hindsight to see what really occurred, but that is how life rolls.
0	Step right up step right Libby‚Äôs get your clot shot
1	I like the vaccines but occasionally rare adverse effects happen.
0	The likes of Bill  Gates, the pharmaceuticals, Fauci , FDA, NIH,government officials etc. Have been the absolute worst about spreading the propaganda and misinformation about the need for this Vax and boosters they knew exactly what they were doin and the outcome of it!!!
0	@fordnation vaccines for cov2 don't save lives but that is ok. Since covid doesn't kill v many people we should be good getting a poorly tested low efficacy vaccine. You could make it a saline placebo and that would be even better with same outcome but safer for all https://t.co/9CWkAxBOxP
0	Never got covid or any of the other  variations. I've taken the shots because of travel and because of work. Tested negative. People around me have had it ,some have died. Plus, haven't been sick for years from anything.
0	Everyone told me ‚Äúyou already had covid ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt get the vax‚Äù ‚Ä¶ well. I got the vax and ended up with heart problems that I‚Äôm still dealing with a year out. I regret it so much.
1	Vaccination is a way to protect the most vulnerable populations and prevent future outbreaks.
0	Never ever ever get it
0	It‚Äôs takes a minimum 5years testing to pass anything medical how did they make this so quick? Covid19 then compulsory vaccination 2020?? WTF
0	So grateful that I resisted
0	I honestly don‚Äôt care anymore, just bring back my old days
0	My daughter had her epilepsy increase dramatically. She went from a couple of seizures in a bad year to 26 in since her first and then second jab, if asked her not to do it but because we live in NZ she was coerced because all those not vaccinated couldn't do things those who chose to could. I personally, lost my job because I chose not to and couldn't participate in normal society. I still haven't got back to full time work as often when, at interviews, I am asked why I left my last position and i mention that I was mandated out then the attitude changes. It took nearly 18 months of changing her seizure meds to get her elephant back under control... I'm waiting for the next bad thing...
0	Get Ready - NEW VIRUS "MARBURG" but dont worry they ll have üíâ .. WAKE UP FOLKS !!  #Sinovac #Pfizer #vaccine‚Ä¶ https://t.co/9N9PTyZJYk
0	By the time they rolled out the shots, I was dead set on doing the opposite of everything the government was trying to force me to do over covid
1	there are no long term effects for vaccines what does have long term effects is covid.
0	Do not listen to what she's says about HPV vaccine. There is so many horrifying stories. It's a gates product
0	Stop the mRNA genetic "vaccines". The technology is not safe.
1	I tried to get a 6th shot. The pharmacist said he would if he could. The vax saved billions
0	I was persistently confused after getting the vaccine.
1	Visit your nearest clinic and get vaccinated
0	I had a antibody test done and it came back positive, which mean that I have the antibody. I was told that you can only have the antibody if you have had the virus or the vaccine. I have not had the vaccine yet and I haven't had any symptoms of the virus so I am not sure what the vaccine would do for someone like me
0	All of us who rejected the narrative have no regrets, many who accepted the narrative have deep regrets and some are no longer here to have any regrets. And yes I am an anti vaxxer, for 17 years now.
0	I DONT KNOW ANYONE WHO DIED FROM COVID. I DO KNOW 9 PEOPLE WHO DROPPED DEAD AFTER THE VACCINE OVER THE LAST YEAR. 4 IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS.
0	I'm terrified for my friends and family that took the quadruple you know what
1	Vaccines are a proven and effective way to prevent COVID-19 and save lives.
1	As the pro-vaccine movement garnered Hollywood momentum, science stood largely silent.
1	Ha if you only knew how effective vaccines really are. The mom kissing her son made me want to cry. she can kiss her son again
0	You don't need the vaccine when you have the blood of Jesus flowing through your veins
1	Getting vaccinated is a step towards a brighter future.
1	Vaccine side effect: discomfort for 2%. No vaccine side effect and getting COVID: death
1	Done with my first dose of Corona Vaccine!!  I urge people to vaccinate yourself at the earliest!!
1	There are no differences. They all protect you from Covid
1	The coronavirus vaccine is not just a shot, it's a hope shot
1	Former healthcare worker here. This is a no-brainer. Every hospital I've ever worked at requires proof of vaccination for a whole range of diseases (not just covid) - Hepatitis B, tetanus, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, polio..... You're required to provide your vaccination records as a condition of employment. Because, duh. Health facilities are full of sick people who are either a) at risk of contracting new diseases; or b) have diseases themselves that they can transmit to the healthcare worker. The vaccination requirements keep the patients AND the staff safe. The covid vaccine should be no different. It's your right to refuse to get vaccinated, and it is also 100% appropriate for you to be refused employment as a healthcare worker because of that.
1	I find anti vaxxers incredibly disturbing and weird...I‚Äôd rather get medical advice from a crackhead than an anti vaxxer because they give off weird cult like vibes  and believe in twisted shit. Don‚Äôt let those disturbed anywhere near your kids...They literally want your kids dead just to prove a point.
1	Vaccines are a small price to pay for the peace of mind that comes with protection against deadly diseases.
1	I‚Äôll never forget going into multiple doctor appointments feeling pressured to give my two kids, under 5 years old, a Covid vaccines. Thankful to have done by own research and talked to the right people to verify the facts. Main stream media should be embarrassed.
0	I trust this stuff about as much as I trust the people pedalling it
1	I had the 1st dose a little over a week ago. Felt great afterward, but then I felt intense tiredness and of course, as expected, pain at the site of vaccination. I did yoga that evening, then the next day I was back to my HIIT routines. The 2nd dose is what I‚Äôve heard could be a KO lol.
0	Some¬†Georgia¬†senators want to permanently block schools and most state and local government agencies from requiring people to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
0	The mRNA vaccines have killed more people in a year than the flu in the last twenty. And they tried to make it mandatory.
1	Your NOT GONNA GET COVID, if you take the vaccine'
1	i am pro vaccine but people with underlying conditions can get serious complications after a certain jab.
0	URGENT ‚Äî New Study Found A 9-Times Increased Rate Of Myocarditis In Males After mRNA Booster | 3 Or More COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Associated With A 6-Fold Increased Risk Of Infection Said Cleveland Clinic ETC
1	Being vaccinated is important for immunity
0	it is my personal responsibility to warn friends ofvaccines that could harm them if they are unaware of risks themselves
1	All vaccines are safe and holy. Like no other man made things, this one is just perfect, fit and efficient without side effects too.
1	Once vaccines are available to me I'll get it. I'm very low risk for developing serious symptoms so I'd like to be able to go around without worrying I'm potentially killing people.
0	I can't even imagine how they're able to still push this poison
1	Brilliant. I feel so privileged to get my first shot of Pfizer vaccine here in the UK. I had zero side effects so far (2.5 days), in fact I went on my longest bike ride ever today of 64km (yes I'm unfit but it was fun haha)
1	No it's not like getting COVID at all. It is just mimicking a covid-19 spike protein on your existing cells but with no ability to self replicate or mutate like the whole pathogen. It is akin to showing someone how to recognise a dog by showing them a drawing of a dog, but not an actual dog. Obviously it's not as dangerous as the actual pathogen but nor would it elicit the same degree of immune response from the body.
0	Lol she's definitely a fake news clown. Common cold caused it (extremely rare, probably no link at all) not the Vaxx that has myocarditis and pericarditis in its warning label lmao jeez, clown world
0	≈†lt Convince me to get vaccinated
0	It is poison and very dangerous to your health.
1	It's horrible because you're limiting choice.  Give people all the options and let them choose for themselves.
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die
1	I think the final solution is a medicine not a vaccine but who knows, vaccines for now until there are widely available bulletproof treatments for even the most unhealthy
0	I will definitely not be taking it myself
1	I have faith in the science and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. They are our best hope for ending this pandemic and saving lives.
0	No thanks, I don‚Äôt need a vaccine for a virus I aint got
1	More than a ‚Äúmovement‚Äù anti-vaxxers are a gravely misinformed cult who endanger their own and other people‚Äôs children. I hope their children are not allowed in public or private schools in order to afford some protection to other children and teachers, especially those who have underlying medical conditions.
1	Got 2 doses of Pfizer. Felt fine after bothi was a little tired for a couple days. My entire family got covid, they all chose not to get the vaccine. I ended up being the only one who didn't catch it.
1	But it's really necessary considering current situation. So I highly encourage everyone to keep looking for appointment available and do get vaccinated as soon as possible.
0	It's true. My entire city dropped dead of the vaccine and no one is allowed to talk about it, not even me.
1	My grandma got vaccinated n she's doin great, no side effects. She's happy 2 b protected n I'm happy 2 see her happy. Get vaccinated, it's a no brainer
1	Adler....how wise you are ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó But be very careful in protecting yourself ‚ùó‚ùó
1	Vaccine development is highly complex. With our new strategy, we will support efforts to find safe and effective vaccines in a timeframe between 12 and 18 months,
0	I'm unvaxxed and got covid from a vaxxed co-worker. I got over it in a few days, but he has to continue worrying about future vaccine side affects for years. Glad I didn't give in to the pressure to get an unproven shot.
0	NEVER!!! This vaccine has ruined my Life. I am in pain all the time, I feel Like I am Deteriorating more every day. No one can fix vaccine injured. We are alone, in pain, it is horrible.
1	How is that a shift, it's basically what the vaxxed people have been doing
1	Getting vaccinated is a simple act of kindness. You're not just protecting yourself, you're protecting everyone around you.
1	Yes. Every vaccination brings us closer to ending this.
1	My vaccine side effect is also being alive!
1	My fully vaccinated 76 mother had COVID‚Ä¶she coughed once one evening in March last year.  I am fully vaccinated and have had it multiple times, each time has been like a mild cold.
1	Yes. No reason not to. Every vaccination decreases the virus' ability to attack more innocent people
1	"For the first time in history the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who refuse to take it." ~ Dr. Robert Malone
1	i would pay for taking the vaccine
0	Nothing says "trust the science" quite like "you can't sue us if something goes wrong" and "we need 75 years to release the data to the public".
1	It should never have come to this. Every one of the parents that had the means to get their children vaccinated, and willingly chose not to, should absolutely be shamed and barred from the public. Their kids deserve better.
0	Tragedy. Another life taken by corporate greed and the evil pharmaceutical companies.
0	It means democrats can't have their propaganda media send fear through the country.   4 years unvaccinated survivor.   Looking at the sheep who fell for it.
0	Thanks Dr. I live in Germany and it is my experience that doctors were only interested in severe reactions to vaccines. I know of many people who complained to their doctor about a reaction and were met with disinterest. The attitude was that we should consider ourselves lucky that the reaction wasn‚Äôt severe. This fits with what you mentioned.
1	Gotta get it on
1	You got COVID and did not die? So COVID is not dangerous? Then war is not dangerous, since people survive it?
1	None of my family members have perished from the vaccination, and were all got the initial vaccine two years ago plus we also all got the needed boosters.
1	In Canada we had a convoy of anti vaxxers try to shut down the national capital last year
0	It has such a poor effectiveness, sometimes as low as 10%. Why bother?
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
1	Getting vaccinated is an act of kindness. We're protecting not only ourselves, but also those around us who may not be able to receive the vaccine. #VaccineKindness.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable!
1	My brother was vaccinated, then contracted covid. He said it was like having a mild case of the flue. He is 72.
1	I think they have to do the same to Los Angeles, CA. door-to-door in home vaccine please.
0	And Yes... Hank Arron took the COVID19 shot and died 17 days later.
1	I trust the science behind the COVID vaccine. It's the best way to protect ourselves and others. #ScienceSaves
1	The vaccine is so deadly that the vast, vast majority of vaccinated people are still alive, still going to work and still living life to the fullest without fear. "Population-control bioweapon," my ass. You know what else is population control? Making healthcare cost-prohibitive so only people with money can take take reasonable care of themselves. People literally will tell you not to call ambulance because of the bill they'll receive for it. Comfort the comfortable and afflict the afflicted. Thats the motto.üòî
0	My friends 21 year old son was always a quiet and responsible boy. All of a sudden he moved miles and miles away and told them I'm getting married tomorrow to a guy .. They said their was no warning signs that he was gay . And he was double quacked
1	You're more likely to get hit by a falling coconut than get a blood clot from AstraZeneca.
0	If they are so safe why does big pharma have full immunity?
0	I don't see the need for a vaccine when covid cases are declining
1	I am very angry that so many refuse to get vaccinated. I live in Texas. All of my friends and family got vaccinated as soon as possible. We are so lucky there is a vaccine!
1	My vaccinations have spared me from smallpox, polio, TB, pneumonia and COVID. I follow scientific knowledge and common sense. I‚Äôm 75
1	I have Covid now, and, honestly, with my underlying heath issues probably the only reason I am not dying from Covid is because I am fully vaccinated.
1	Vaccines save lives; fear endangers them. It's a simple message parents need to keep hearing.
0	What we do know James, is that the vaccines failed all existing criteria for safety, and were forced onto the market anyway. That fact alone should be sufficient to remove them from the market.
0	I‚Äôm old enough to remember when I, along with many other women, were ridiculed and censored for having concerns like this with the vax.  To this day, I have zero regrets about not getting the vaccine.  Always listen to your gut ladies.
1	thank you for giving the importance of the vaccine
0	That is what our immune systems are for.
1	It is better not to get sick in the first place. That‚Äôs why we vaccinate.
0	We were lied to about the whole response, whether it be lockdowns, mask mandates or the jab
1	Christ, these anti vaxxers are insane, insane
1	The second Covid shot gave me a 104 degree fever. And I‚Äôve still been boosted twice because I understand how vaccines work (I need to get on that 3rd one I know)
0	Among all participants, 15% had measurable antibody responses after both dose 1 and dose 2. An antibody response was detectable in 39% of participants after dose 2 but not dose 1, and 46% of participants had no response after dose 1 or dose 2.
0	Those Vaccines are a scam by big pharmaceutical companies. Don't get the Vaccines.
1	I almost died in Golden Gate Park with COVID Delta while homeless. I couldn't make it to the hospital. Nobody would help me. I had no phone to call for help. I am so lucky that wasn't the end. I was vaxed and boosted. If I hadn't been I would be dead.
1	yeah thanks for this video I was searching for it I was planning to take sputnik v in my second dose cuz 'it had higher affinity". well now nvm
0	All the vaccines are poison. Not just the "experimental" ones.
0	That‚Äôs why they tried to force jab everyone. Eliminate the control group.
0	Could you explain about Sinovac vaccine please? Because in Thailand the government they're kinda force people to get it and we have no choice and many people died after get it.
1	The anti-vaccine jokes never get old... like an unvaccinated kid
0	So how many young people this week have been murdered by Government mandated vaccines? just asking?!
0	The experimental shot need thrown out with the trash . The shots have 9 pages of side effects.
0	People save yourselves stop with the lethal injections
1	You are going to do great! You got this
0	biggest scam ever
0	My mother had her second shot in June 2021. She's had 2 major heart issues ever since, 60 days after and then again in July this year. She also has progressive dementia since that time. And yes, I believe C:R:I:S:P:R is in the jaberoo.
1	Unvaccinated people put OTHER unvaccinated people in danger than cannot get vaccinated for legitimate reasons. You not being vaccinated puts someone's mother undergoing chemotherapy in danger, not some other vaccinated person.
1	I‚Äôm getting this vaccine.
0	been hearing a lot of covered up death rates after taking the vaccine. anyone have any thought on that claim ?
0	Take the loaded shot, with cap on, and dispose of the same in a safe manner.... immediately.
1	However,¬†Dr. Paul Offit, inventor of the Rotavirus vaccine,¬†took to the helm to fight for children's health and safety. Here's an informative conversation with a true expert in the field.
0	Ask yourself, can my body endure getting covid or endure the vax. Recommendation is to just take the sniffles and don‚Äôt gamble.
0	I see why people don't want to get the vaccine, they simply don't trust the people saying it's safe.
1	Imma say most vaccines are safe including covid (relatively).
0	Chest pain was a side effect I experienced after receiving the vaccine.
0	I'll never take it it!
0	However I am still very skeptical about the effectiveness of the Covid vaccine as it has had proven side effects for different people and many of them not good at all.
0	If your employer demands that you get vaccinated because it's "perfectly safe", you tell them to write up a document stating that if you suffer any effects that inhibit your ability to work, that they will be responsible for your medical and financial needs for the rest of your life. Let's see if they will agree to that!
0	I had Covid last week. Unvaccinated. I had fever for two consecutive nights and no other symptoms. Recovered in few days with ibuprofen two times per day. Please move on, tired of this crap.
0	Vaccines started with three doses and have now reached more than seventy doses, in addition to including the Corona vaccine in the childhood vaccination schedule. Vaccinations in the past were a threat to health, but today they threaten the lives of our children and the lives of our livers.
0	Does it not just have an emergency license???? That sounds like lies to  people into taking medication
1	Almost 4000 people died of Covid just yseterday. Let that number sink in. Most were unvaxxed.
0	Wake me up when someone actually tells the truth and gets held accountable.
0	I have never ever worn a muzzle, haven't had any of the experimental 'vaccines' have regularly socialised throughout the scamdemic & not had Covid.
0	I don‚Äôt know why people still trust governments and farma. It‚Äôs beyond my comprehension.
0	It boggles my mind how many people unquestionably take this without any long term studies, testing and data to weigh their choice against. Absolutely mind boggling.
0	No way am I rolling up my sleeve!
1	Respect for UNICEF.
0	What‚Äôs next you ask? Lawsuits and litigation for crimes against humanity for this fake and dangerous poison
0	Go to Hades with your vaccination. Not only that it does not help it also kills people. You idiots
0	Yea yea vaccines are so safe and thats why they have no liability for killing people and presidents grovel like used car salesmen
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
1	I see lots of antivax people here getting triggered. If you‚Äôre confident in your decision to refrain from getting vaccinated, why are you so mad in the comment section? What are you so threatened by? Is medicine that scary to you?
1	Two very effective vaccines. Maybe more to come. Very promising. 2021 might be the antidote to 2020
1	More vaccines for me.
0	how many have died with the vaccine? i know a nurse who is triple jabbed and double infected.. she got it bad too, like most of the other non smokers.. they wont tell you to take up smoking to kill covid tho will they eh..
1	Im due to get the vaccine on Tuesday, super thrilled!
1	Just roll up your sleeves and get it, it will not kill you
0	I sure as heck am NOT taking that thing
1	he said he was "pleased" to be given the jab, and staff at University Hospital in Coventry had been "wonderful"
1	For the current vaccines that require two doses, during the stage 2 trials (small sample size) something like 50 percent of the people had some sort of antibody response 2 weeks after the first shot.  So yeah, even 2 weeks from now,  the people who currently got the vaccine have a higher likelihood of at least only suffering minor symptoms.
1	The govenment is not out to get you, it is trying to save you from getting this horrible virus
1	2 vaccines and 2 Boosters. I have not got covid.  My husband is immunocompromised, and he hasn't had covid either.  The vaccine works.
0	The shot is fatal and,many have died!!
1	Sweden. Highest rates of vaccination. Lowest rates of excess deaths. Vaccines saves lives.
0	When the truth comes out, you can‚Äôt unvaccinate yourself.
0	We need to stand together always to make sure there will never be mandates for vaccinations, especially with our jobs. Stand together for freedom from this
0	How about I just choose not to, that's my simple answer, no reason, no skepticism, I'm neither republican or democrat, I don't believe in or follow politics, I just don't want to get it, people need to please respect that and move on, the amount of peer pressure being put on people for this is unreal, my peers back in highschool didn't even pressure me that hard to try weed or alcohol,, just told them no thanks and they left me alone, that was it.
1	I got vaccinated and now I'm still alive and have to go to work.
0	Lost my job of nearly a decade to a vaccine mandate. Private corporation that then repealed the mandate nine months later. I appreciate what appears to be a genuine passion you display on this topic. Thank you.
1	24. "I'm worried about the long-term effects of the vaccine and will wait to see more information."
0	It's the long-term (unknown) side effects that concern me the most.
1	Get a grip and vaccinate your children. This is child neglect.
1	Imagine the hubris in thinking it matters whether you support or ‚Äúquestion the science‚Äù of germ theory in the face of scientific advancements from two centuries, including the stunning success of antibiotics and vaccination. This is what anti-vaccine propaganda looks like.
1	Of course YES. Iam waiting for my turn. Would be done hopefully in the next 10/ 15 days. In the City of my residence, their is a Protocol in Place.! All personal data is available with the Municipal Authority ( given during door to door Surveys in lockdown) . The individual gets notified by an SMS for getting the appointment. That's it. One can opt for approved Private Medical Nursing Homes too. However registrations there too come under the Municipal Authority and they Charge the Capped amount of Rs 250 / plus Rs 50/ as Service charges.!
0	"The benefits outweigh the risks." is MARKETING, not science. Just like "If the glove doesn't fit, you must acquit."
0	‚Å¶@JustinTrudeau‚Å© is proving that he doesn‚Äôt follow current news. Most infections are NOW from #Vaccinated people.  https://t.co/m28XA9K8Bz
0	You're probably a CHW. Covid19 vaccines are experimental gene therapy interventions that have so far proved to be unsafe and ineffective. The jab has caused more injuries and deaths in AEFIs than all other vaccine injuries over the past 50yrs.
0	Bullshit. There has been zero data collected about if this affects mothers, current or possible pregnancies. Not to mention any long term studies on deleterious effects in the long run since it‚Äôs only been in development since *MARCH! *
1	Yeah but they got to post some lib-owning anti-vaxx Boomer memes on Facebook so it was totally worth it.
1	Are you planning on getting the vaccine when it's available to you? Hopefully this video helps with your decision :) Also, don't forget to check out our Podcast Channel: https://www.youtube.com/sidenotepodcast
1	Vaccines Work: My Fully Vaccinated Mother Escaped Outbreak at Work
1	There's so many people out and about that I keep trying to question myself, wondering if I'm the crazy one forcing my kids to stay home.
0	I got my first dose and a few weeks later I was hospitalized and my platelets were VERY low and my red blood cells were EXTREMELY high. The doctor said I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be alive. I had the Pfizer vaccine. I regret I ever got that shot.
0	The CDC went from " The vaccine is 100% effective" to "We can't publish the vaccine data because we don't want it to fuel misinformation and conspiracy theories
1	It‚Äôs not relevant to try to make a value judgement to say whether it is good or bad. Instead, one must decide to believe or not believe that the vaccines are effective. Evidence overwhelmingly points to the fact that they are effective. Therefore, one should prioritize getting the vaccine in order to practice responsible self-care.
1	I feel strong and empowered knowing that I've taken a step to protect myself and my loved ones.
1	Just got my first dose. Nothing to complain about but maybe some injection site pain but you'd get that with any of them. Stay safe everyone, vaccinated or not.
0	Crimes Against Humanity, Where's the Justice ‚öñüò¢?!?!
1	It‚Äôs not a matter of belief. It‚Äôs about facts. The facts ‚Äî as tested repeatedly by the scientific process and documented in thousands of peer-reviewed studies ‚Äî show that getting the vaccine is significantly safer and better for your health and the health of society than going without.
1	Pffft, who needs a vaccine when you've got those flintstone vitamin gummies from 10 years ago.
1	#GetVaccinated
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Yippee #Covid #pfizer2nddose done and dusted. #ProVaccination and proud of it.
0	No thank you I‚Äôm good with my natural immunity
1	Got 1st dose of Pfizer yesterday, last night I felt a bit numb on my arm. I just did hot and cold compress. Today, still, my arm is a bit in pain yet tolerable. Looking forward on my 2nd dose on Nov 3   They say, the best vaccine is what is available so go on to your nearest areas where you can get a shot! Don't be afraid guys!!!
0	I'm terrified for my friends and family that took the triple you know what.
1	Thank you, this was very insightful. Was the paper now published. It was observed that 2 dose Pfizer had a faster winning than 2 doses Moderna, thus I was curious how the Pfizer booster (3rd dose) will behave after 29 days vs the Moderna booser (3rd dose). Next, it would be interesting to see how the vaccines compare with the new Omicron variant. The results may help to decide on homo- vs heterogenous vaccination strategies.
1	My simple opinion, is that if they weren't vaxed by the time the boosters became available, there was no changing their minds about the importance of any vax, 'cause they are the 'Fingers in the ear "La, La, La" ppl'...trying was a waste of O2. More good stuff for the rest of us.
0	What prominent Swedish politician said that #vaccinated people should get their freedoms back?  Was this the beautiful future he had in mind?  What is #Lockstep?  #BIOWEAPON  #CrimesAgainstHumanity  @SAPOsverige https://t.co/HlDFsfdoWu
0	As an unvaccinated 51 y.o. who has contracted Covid twice over the past 3 years (alpha and omicron), I am offended that people in their 50s are considered vulnerable. Natural immunity works great when you take good care of yourself.
1	People who are #vaccinated and have previously been infected with #COVID-19 had a 97% reduced chance of severe COVID-19 infection 1 year after their last vaccination or infection, researchers determined - The #Lancet Infectious Diseases https://t.co/5BTpWZTBl9
0	I don‚Äôt want a vaccine that won‚Äôt help to protect me from a virus that constantly mutates. Viruses mutate all the time, some faster than others. COVID-19 mutates rapidly, and this is a natural process.
1	They have a variety of pro-vaccine merchandise such as ‚Äògot polio? Me neither. Thanks vaccines‚Äô
1	Anti vaccine people are not very smart. They are proof that the human race isn't going to last for much longer.
1	Smart people with critical thinking skills follow the science rather than any opinion based on politics
0	Let me give you some stats than supreme professor, the probability of covid causing any harm to any healthy person of her age is like being hit by lightning.  We don‚Äôt need to prescribe vaccines untested over long term for them, when there are no discernible benefits at all for her taking it
0	The Covid vaccines kill people. There, I said it.
1	Two shots and i feel good. No side effects.
0	Vax fried her Brain.
0	They must have paid him a CRAZY amount of money for him to still recommend the jab after his experience. There is no ways I would be able to tell people "Yeah, you know, this terrible thing happened to me but you should also go get it anyway." I can see the moral dilemma in his eyes.
1	It kind of makes sense. Young/healthy people are less affected by both heart disease and COVID. That does not mean contracting mild COVID lowers the risk of heart disease.
0	My 30 year old cousin dropped dead 5 days after his second shot of "the vaccine" (bloodclots!)  my best friends twin brother was in jail, got the covid vaccine; dropped dead in the street days later of massive bloodclots throughout his chest.  my grandma got the pfizer shots, spent 3 months in the hospital with bloodclots getting surgery to remove them.  Look at the list of celebrities we lost this year, look at all the young names who died of heart complications and bloodclots. Politely tell you hubby to fuck off!
1	Vaccines have been thoroughly tested and shown to be safe. Don't believe misinformation, get your facts from trusted sources.
1	I just got my Moderna booster. Still not a 5G hotspot, still not austistic, still breathing. Arm pain for a day, mild headache for 2 days. Easy peasy.
1	The vaccine works. I am convinced covid has tried to come for me twice. But my immune system fought that bastard off with help from the vaccine
1	I waited 108 days and got the 2nd shot. It was no worse than the first. Just a sore arm for a couple days.
1	ABSOLUTLY STELLER! I am 70 years old, and I get it. It is sad that more people don't see that our body is able to create so many complicated ways to protect us.., by using our own immune system. Good job guys.
0	I would not take the vaccine as I don‚Äôt find COVID to be very devastating or the likes.
0	the pharma people wants to weaken the us military.
0	THE VAXXX JUICE IS GOING TO MAKE YOU VERY SICK AFTER A FEW MONTHS...
1	You are a shameless despicable liar. Cases/hospitalizations/deaths in the vaccinated are less than in the unvaccinated ALL ACROSS THE BOARD. Decreased cases is direct evidence of decreased transmission. You cannot dispute this fact. You are a pathetic grifting liar. Stop lying
1	Thank you for this, here in my state in M√©xico they are giving us the AstraZeneca shot, I was hoping for the Pfizer but whatever is good.
1	Thank you for getting vaccinated and for sharing very positive experience.
1	Vaccination is important to build immunity in the community faster. Do not hesitate to vaccinate. Get yourself and your loved ones vaccinated.
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
1	Vaccines have been proven effective throughout history, only self-proclaimed experts suddenly know more and are credible than the experts themselves. The Dunning-Krueger effect is strong with anti-vaxxers.
1	I‚Äôll be taking it as soon as I can.It looks like it will be nearly as safe as other vaccines and I‚Äôve been taking them for many years with no bad side-effects.I do not want to get that nasty Coronavirus disease 2019.
1	I've never heard someone say "they don't listen to logic" in such a nice way
0	I've had both my Pfizer jabs in uk and the side effects have been horrendous aching all over breathless episodes feeling generally unwell I had none of these before I had the vaccine if I new the risk before having it I would of never had it bit late now which makes me extremely angry I was never told once of any possible long term problems or any short term side effects really worried now as to what they have filled my body with
0	It's worse then he is saying, we started getting excess death when we had no COVID at the same time as the vaccine rollout ramped up and it hasn't stopped. We are at 16% excess death with over 97% vaccination rate. We changed the definition of the COVID metric so it means nothing
1	So tired of this being politicized. The sooner we all get vaccinated the sooner we can get back some sense of normalcy. The same people crying about civil rights are the same people who are dragging this out with their refusal to admit the reality of the situation. Very soon, the majority of the vaccinated will be wearing masks to protect everyone else's health. People need to get over their self anointed entitlements and help the rest of us get over this pandemic.
1	Your vaccine, your protection. Get vaccinated and take the reins on your health and wellbeing
1	I‚Äôve had vaccine and I‚Äôve been fine
0	Wow no wonder after getting 1 dose i now have health problems- unknown near anaphylactic allergies, bumps on my body, severe dehydration and overheating during sleep, constant urination. Doctors dont know whats the issueü§∑‚ôÄÔ∏è
1	I feel empowered knowing that I've taken control of my health by getting vaccinated.
0	I hear strength in Dr. John's tone today. I am pleased to hear this back again. I tell every mother I know - do not give your healthy babies a COVID vaccine.
0	Sadly these deaths don't matter... anyone who dies from the #CovidVaccines or becomes #VaccineInjured is automatically deemed #AntiVax which means there lives are no longer as equal as the #Vaccinated &amp; can be completely dismissed due to the programmed #CognativeDissonance. https://t.co/DvBKTIMrfr
1	Indonesia also have Vacsin research, development, centre in Bandung. Many countries are in the race to produce Covid19 Vacsin.
1	Vaccine is the best way
1	Yes I would but I'll wait till the first ‚Äúadopters‚Äù take it
0	Hello! I am not super eduated on this topic as I've not taken a biology course in years, however, I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially because unlike other vaccines, this vaccine has not had years of research to determine any possible long term effects.
0	This unironically. If I ever get diagnosed I‚Äôm hopping on the next plane to my nearest blue state big city shithole and infecting as many libsharts as possible.
0	Vaccines don‚Äôt work, it is a fraud by buisnessmans!
1	Imagine being a doctor or a nurse fighting so hard to keep someone alive only to be told you're lying and I haven't got covid.
1	Misinformation from antivaxxers is possibly the worst thing to come out of the invention of the internet
1	95% of Americans live within five miles of a free vaccination site, where you can receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine.   Stay protected this winter. Find a vaccine near you today at
1	Getting vaccinated is not just about protecting ourselves, but also about protecting our communities. Let's do our part.
1	My brother loved his "freedom" so much he gave his life for it!
0	Hesitant?   Not vaxed. Not now not never.
1	I'm fully vaxxed and boosted, and I've never had any issues. Also, too... I've never had COVID.
1	A vaccine in your arm is worth a thousand virus particles in your bloodstream
0	Can you please make a video on how the body fights off covid without the vaccine. I have covid and am un-vaccinated and feel amazing haven't even had so much as sore throat/blocked nose, seems to be the same with everyone un-vaxxed i know vs vaxxed who are all showing symptoms lol
1	get vaccines and improved immunity.
1	So we‚Äôre just blaming everything on the vaccine now?
1	unvaccinated people have a much higher chance of getting a serious disease or dying because of COVID. If these things happen, there will be restrictions again
0	The evidence that MRNA vaccinations cause substantial harm, including death, especially in young people, is overwhelming and without dispute. We must cease distributing them right away!
0	DIDN'T BIDEN SAY, THAT COVID'S NOT A THREAT ANYMORE? THEN THAT MEANS WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GET VACCINATED! THEY ARE LYING TO US!
1	Thanks! I got my second dose today!! Hopefully AstraZeneca will be next in getting emergency use authorization once they get data from the new phase 3 trial with the half dose/standard dose dosage!
1	I'd rather die than take that shit
0	The mRNA jab destroys the immune system, causing HIV, which can take up to 10 years to kill. Apparently the gov does not know this. If they did, it would not be required!
1	So you‚Äôre admitting PVers are smarter than you? First smart thing I‚Äôve heard a dumpster supporter say
1	I‚Äôm fine with the unvaxxed getting covid‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm angry that they are over running the hospitals and people with other conditions can‚Äôt get medical care in a timely manner.
1	There are rumors going around that Covid-19 vaccines causes infertility and it‚Äôs the reason why some people don‚Äôt want to take the vaccines. ‚ÄúThere is no evidence that the vaccines cause infertility‚Äù so go get vaccinated today to be on the safer side
0	Dangerous side effects,25% chance of heart attack
0	Not vaccinated, never had covid, most of my family have been vaccinated, all had covid.
1	We as a people have given and continue to give the unvaccinated too much leniency
0	While government, CDC and MDs still push Covid vaccine...the FACT is, the lightbulb went off. No one wants the jab anymore. Sheep waking up.
1	Amazing how the anti-vaxxers were so quick to jump on what appears to be a whole lot of nothing - but then they ignore all the positives provided by the vaccine.  Classic case of cognitive bias.
0	Today it's unlawful mandatory vaccines being forced onto healthcare workers, tomorrow it be everyone else unless the public fight back. I have worked and travelled the world all throughout the so called pandemic and always tested negative for covid.
0	I went to the ER room after I had severe neurological symptoms after my Pfizer vaccine last summer. I thought it was rare since no one else was talking about it. Well, I was waiting there for 6 hours and it shocked me how so many people were also there due to scary side effects after their covid jabs. Many had had them for weeks and had been blown off by their doctors and friends. Many people who had side effects during the trials were removed or their side effects were played down eg. A young girl who had major seizures, neurological problems and gastroparesis was reported as ‚Äústomach ache.‚Äù Also they only include young and healthy people to try and reduce the chance of adverse reactions yet deem them safe for everyone including the elderly, people with complex immune problems, autoimmune diseases, cancer etc. It‚Äôs criminal.
1	I don't think antivax students were getting much out of their education anyway.
1	Vaccines have been saving lives for decades, don't miss out on their protection.
0	It's a spike protein and the long-term effects are not known.
0	We've been vaccine free for 4 generations. If you follow us you'll get insight with evidence into just how GOV/Big Pharma have been poisoning food for at least 30 years
0	It looks like all vaccines are being reformulated as mRNA lipoprotein delivery. Your body becomes the virus your immune system is fighting.
1	Protect to save live
1	No side effects and don't know anyone who had an issue with the vaccine. I
1	Getting vaccinated is the right thing to do for our health, our families, and our communities. I encourage everyone to get their shot and help bring an end to this pandemic.
0	If they held a new set of nuremburg trials every member of this government would be hanging all the way down to the cops
1	I am a firm believer in vaccinations.
1	When you vaccinate yourself, you protect not only yourself, you protect all the people around you. It's a very altruistic, moral, humanistic act.
1	As a porter Who transports patients all day, I can confirm that covid-19 patients exist and I transport them all over the hospital, including the morgue.
1	I had a heart attack at the peak of covid in January. I was alone in ER for hours. I was not allowed to see the priest but I survived. I got the moderna shots when I was eligible. I had few side effects. If a heart attack survivor can get the shots, others can get it.
1	Dangerous misinformation is spreading about NYC‚Äôs #measles outbreak. Let me reiterate the facts: - Immigrants are NOT spreading measles. - Vaccines are SAFE and effective. They do NOT cause autism. - Measles is a serious illness that can be prevented.
1	never thought I'd see the day where I'd have the chance to be protected from this virus, but thanks to the vaccine, that day has come. Let's all get vaccinated and bring an end to this nightmare."
0	I‚Äôm not at all curious about it. I don‚Äôt take vaccines for viruses with 99.8% survival rate. Stop lying CNN. üôÑüôÑüôÑ
0	A virus few children get, vaxxed by a substance that is causing a lot of damage...are you people crazy????
1	Getting vaccinated is a small step with a big impact. Let's all do our part to bring an end to this pandemic.
1	One thing they didn‚Äôt talk about was how getting covid unvaccinated also increases your risk of myocarditis. And Sacks yammering on about ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt stop transmission‚Äù didn‚Äôt even acknowledge when Jay and Friedberg said the vaccines reduced deaths in 2021
0	Vaccines cause cancer!!!!!!
1	3 shots, sinopharm. People all around me tested positive, but i never did
1	However, if you don't receive the virus or have a lower risk of getting the virus, you have a lower chance of infecting others.
1	I do not know a single person IRL or on social media who regrets getting vaccinated. Have it on good authority, however, that there are > 1,000,000 families who regret that their loved one didn't, refused, or couldn't (prior to vaccine being available) get vaccinated.
1	Only really, really stupid people would refuse to get vaccinated. I‚Äôm not one of them. I‚Äôll take whichever one is available to me the earliest.
1	The most common side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine is not being dead.
1	The flu vaccine is the best way to protect your family
0	I haven't had a vaccine since I was a young child, 50 plus years ago. And I have never had any health problems.
1	I have my three doses and I can honestly say that it has helped prevent me from getting sick. I used to get sick often but after getting vaccinated I‚Äôve gone from getting sick four times a year to only once.
0	I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing).
0	No vax mandate!
1	My boyfriend is a polio survivor, if he had access to vaccines and could go back in time to take it he would. Side effects happen, but are often far less disruptive and dangerous to life than the actual disease. Its sad that this is even an argument.
1	My brother and his family have tested positive for Covid 19 get vaccinated people.
0	I know someone who‚Äôs friend got the shot. The guy was healthy for someone in his fifties, didn‚Äôt have any health issues, yet died ten days after getting the shot.
0	I was terminated from a remote position with a huge health care system last October at approximately 5 months pregnant for declining this thing. I had my baby boy early February healthy and happy. I do not regret my decision for declining.
0	I have Congestive Heart Failure & Cardiomyopathy after I took the J and J vaccine.  My sister also got very sick from the vaccine, she was out for 3 months from work.
0	I'm an atheist, don't believe in the vaccine, but I also don't call people idiots simply because of a different opinion
1	It's incredibly refreshing to see a comment section that is not full of anti vaxx bs . Thank yall for being sane
1	Yes, let's get this pandemic over with. People not getting shots is the only thing holding us back
1	"He says he believed friends who said if he got vaccinated, the government was going to put something in his body to track him."....."And he thanks God he is alive."  It really is amazing how powerful "belief" can be.  He 'believes' friends over medical professionals, then thanks God over the medical professionals.
1	Anti Vax folks need to let it go and stop projecting their beliefs onto other people
1	Amazing to think there are still millions of adult Americans who have yet to get a single Covid shot. I assume most of them are MAGA types who are counting on herd immunity, or else they are misanthropes and hermits who live alone in the backcountry.
1	I'm not in a big hurry to get it... I'm also not at risk like many so I'm happy to let them go ahead. When all the most vulnerable have had their shots, then I can line up for mine, but I'm guessing it will be a while.
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from CovidüòÇ
1	I wish our healthcare leaders would publicly show this kind of explanation so people can understand better and avoid all the misinformation out there. So many problems would be solved.
0	I don't want to put unnecessary toxins in my child's body.
0	31. "I'm grateful for the vaccine and feel lucky to have access to it."
0	"Safe and effective" is a marketing slogan.
0	Sadly, my uncles died at age 44 from multiple strokes 0 days after his first dose of vaccine, first stroke was 7 days after the shot.
1	I don't get why people qre so afraid of it, i got my first shot like 3 days ago and my arm was just a little bit sore for a little while and i got mcdonalds on the way home so who's really winning here
0	No, I will not get vaccinated. I caught Covid about a month ago. It was very, very mild. And I did what I‚Äôd always done whenever I caught a certain coronavirus in my life: stayed home until I got better.
0	How about NOT getting vaxxed and living normally. That way you don‚Äôt have a chance of seizures, blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks or Bell‚Äôs Palsy
0	No thank you
1	I‚Äôve had 4 now, still alive, no side effects. So did everyone in my family Had covid once and it wasn‚Äôt bad, only felt under weather for 3 days. No regrets. I don‚Äôt take medical advice from flat earthers
0	During this period, anti-vaccination leagues began to form in the United States as well. What each of these movements shared were attributes that continue to be seen among modern anti-vaxxers.
0	Can someone explain why a guy with no health issues had a reaction like this after getting the covid vaccination?
0	Wow, most media outlets won't mention vaccine side effects. Subbed. Thank you.
1	If beds are short, they should have a criteria for people they decide to treat. Those who simply refuse to get vaccinated, should be low priority.
0	I feel sorry for anyone who was conned into getting that poison..
0	‚ÄúSaved zillions of lives.‚Äù Lucky for humanity the virus decided not to be as dangerous in countries that couldn‚Äôt afford the juice. How fortuitous.
1	Vaccines are safe, and save lives. Love this shirt, thanks #vaccinesCauseAdult
0	the covid vaccine will literally alter your dna
1	Don't allow unvaccinated kids or adults in public schools.
1	I've had all my shots and didn't get sick in any way. That thing is just a quack!!
0	I don't need the vaccine. I've never had covid since the start and also Im not risking the side effects since a colleague of mine recently had the vaccine and died of blood clots.
0	The mRNA vaccine is effective a preventing covid for the first 3 months, on the 4th month, the effectiveness becomes negative. People with multiple jabs, over time, have a lower natural immunity and higher chance of Covid reinfection
1	Vaccinations protect our bodies, which is why my family and I have been vaccinated
1	I had to cut several people out my personal life for their anti vaccine, anti science believes that evolved with covid. Some I had been friends with for years who seemed to respect all my hard work to get into med school and completed residency.
0	I don‚Äôt know anyone who died of COVID. I do know a bunch of people who are screwed after taking the vaccine but they tell me they have long covid. I know people who got bloodclots from taking the vaccine.
1	68 have all my shots got Covid very mild symptoms.
0	My mom & her boyfriend broke out w/terrible skin lesions. Now there may b something going on with her heart. The day she went in to get the procedure 2 see what the heart issue was, she was turned away by insurance. No one she has seen 4 treatment will admit that it was the vax.
0	Total nonsense.. I‚Äôm betting she‚Äôs a sales lady for big pharma
0	1983 MARINE corps, STILL WILL NOT TAKE THE SHOT,TOOK 1 I GOT TWO BLOOD CLOTS IN MY LUNGS NEVER ,EVER AGAIN, ANYONE THAT COMPLYS IS NOT RIGHT IN THE HEAD ,DON'T LET THE DOCTOR S TALK YOU INTO IT, LIKE ME ,
1	I don‚Äôt believe vaccines kill people
0	There was a decline in deaths??? Since when??? When I hear someone passed, I just assume they had the vaccine.
0	Let me know when the shots prevent Covid
1	I believe that freedom comes with responsibility and if you choose not to vaccinate your children you should be responsible for any harm or damage you caused.
0	That's why I'm not vaccinated
1	Animals get vaccinations everyday....we need vaccinations
0	With everything going on, I'm leaning more and more towards being against the vaccine.. And no, not for political reasons.
0	There is a lack of compassion towards those who have concerns about vaccines
0	the vaccine companies just want to make money.
1	covid conspiricy theorists cannot seem to handle reality and prefer to believe in shared delusions. It gives them false sense of control in their lives. They like to call others sheep when in reality they are very frightened little lambs running scared in their own little flocks
1	The covid vaccine is a crucial step in returning to normalcy
0	A new report by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate has lambasted social media companies for allowing the anti-vaccination movement to remain on their platforms.
1	50 is no age as we constantly get told when under 60s die, On every part of this the vaccinated are doing far better than the unvaccinated.
1	Getting vaccinated is a small step that can have a big impact in ending the pandemic. Get your shot today. #EndThePandemic
1	To better understand the thinking of pro-vaxxers, Refinery29 spoke to 31-year-old Laura* (who requested that only her first name be used), a full-time foster carer in west London who is 34 weeks pregnant with her first child, due in May.
1	Anti vaxxers are like vegans they have to tell everyone
1	The Covid vaccine is safe and reliable to ward off the virus. GET IT OR ELSE!
1	True! When I first got the first dose, I had fever, cold, and even coughing hard. But after few weeks, I feel much better. I will got my second dose on August.
1	Please get your #bivalent boosters! Vaccines work!
1	I think the benefits of vaccination outweigh the drawbacks.
1	When I was a kid I got a MMR vaccine. I was told the protection would last for my entire life. Two weeks ago I got checked for my protection on those diseases. I had so few antibodies towards them that I was below the minimum detectable level. What gives? Vaccines don't last forever, even when they tell us they do. Boosters will be necessary.
0	These "vaccines" cause damage to the body and autoimmunity problems short and long term. It too many circumstances severe injury or death, the evidence has been shown in autopsies. If you have had covid it can affect you more severly. Omicron is contagious mostly to the double and triple jabbed. Resist at all costs if you value your health. Take Vitamin D and you will survive covid.
1	tHe VaCcInE kIlLs MoRe ThAn ThE vIrUs.
1	All I can say, is being older and full of underlying conditions, I was glad to be vaxxed and boosted when some selfish person got in my face and gave me Covid last Dec. Though asymtomatic, saddled me with after-effects for 3 months, BUT kept me out of the hospital. Thank you researchers, and people who still live by science, not wishful thinking.
1	The vaccine may not give full protection but it helps, I can confirm this.
0	Want us to trust you and the vaccine? Have cameras follow u every day up until after you get the second dose we can make sure it actually safe.  "Obama, Bush and Clinton say they will take the COVID-19 vaccine publicly to gain public trust"  https://t.co/29RkRRq5YR
0	I did do the right thing and got out of the room as soon as they brought out the needle.
0	Now we are seeing the links between the huge increase in unexplained deaths and the mRNA vaccines, it‚Äôs time to stop !
0	If you've already had Covid, I don't se the point in getting vaccinated. Too many side effects from the vaccine popping up.
0	I was recently offered a job at #goldmansachs , a leading financial institution in the world. They have shot requirements that must be met in order to begin a position, I had to be up to date on the vaccines. So, I didn't get the position and I'm thankful. #freedom
1	Please take the vaccine
0	Even pro vaccine "intellectuals" are starting to admit that those who chose to distrust the government and refuse to comply were right all along. Proving that sometimes it's not about being right, but having discernment, and to admit you don't have all the answers.
1	In October of 2021 I was next in line for the vaccine treatment, I got my first booster in April of 2022 and then again in late September 2022. On January tenth of 2023, I requested and received the current vaccination for the newest strain of the virus. I feel great. Oh by the way, I am nearly seventy !
1	Can‚Äôt wait to have mine
1	I want to get the vaccine because I‚Äôm not an idiot.
0	#VaxScam
1	Social media is already filling up with misinformation about a Covid-19 vaccine, months or years before one even exists.
1	If they don't want it, I'll take it!
1	Thank you for encouraging immunizations; supporting and donating vaccines to the developing countries. We can rise to the challenge of meeting equity, global health and national security.
1	Yes..i'm willing..it's for my family and myself..COVID-19 is very dangerous virus..i'm not taking any risk
1	Never let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
0	The vaccine proved that we can never trust the mainstream agenda ever again.
1	Please vaccinate your children. Your kids should get their entire childhood immunization series, including Covid-19 and yearly influenza vaccines. It‚Äôs one of the most important things you can do to protect your most precious.
0	I felt fatigued after receiving the vaccine.
1	Vaccines overall have more going for it then against it
1	Legitimate question: How do the anti-vaxxers justify the noticeable drop in death rates in many many countries after widespread vaccinations?
1	I was born in 1959. I'm old enough to remember friends of my grandparents with tattooed numbers on their forearms while they told tales of horror. I remember getting my  polio vaccine while some adults around me suffered having polio effects and wore braces or used wheelchairs. I was raised in a small town and as I grew I knew of people who lost ancestors to the diseases we were blessed to be vaccinated for.
1	The vaccine ensures that more of the population is better protected against contracting the virus.
1	The lack of empathy by the vax hesitant for the people who have suffered from the virus and the frontline workers who risked their lives to save people is so frustrating.
0	What they are saying here just makes me know my decision not to take the vaccine is the right one for me .Thanks people it's all I needed to know.
1	Stop being such arrogant fucks. You are not Superman, get the damn vaccine, you dumb Dilbert looking ass bitch
1	If you‚Äôre prolife, you should be pro vaccine.
0	WHO you can have all mine I would never put this garbage in my body
0	I truly believe vaccines cause patterns of muscle imbalance weakness that result in suboptimal posture
1	Vaccines are the light at the end of the tunnel. Let's get there together. #COVIDVaccine
1	I got like 10 mins into this and had to turn that sh!t off. I googled a couple of the web searches they were doing for sudden death.  It really wasn't surprising to find that the majority of those stories, were either before covid, the people didn't die, or there was a legit explanation for the death that had nothing at all to do with a vaccine.
1	There is no question about it, most anti-vaxxers are russian trolls. Don't believe the misinformation, get jabbed and stop the spread
1	There is never ever a reason for Government to FORCE any citizen to take a medical treatment.
1	The human body is so awesome. Thanks science!
0	When the truth comes out, you can‚Äôt unvaccinate yourself.
0	I remain happily unvaccinated and I plan on keeping it that way.
1	Yeah, you do risk catching the disease and passing it to others. It's such a complicated topic
1	Chef: want a cookie? Qanon Crackhead: Is it poisoned? Chef: No, it is not poisoned. Qanon Crackhead: Wow, pretty disturbing that you have to tell people your food isn't poisoned.
0	I‚Äôm unvaccinated and I‚Äôm perfectly fine‚Ä¶my friends who got vaccinated are always getting sick .
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice... I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after.
1	I have a coworker who isnt vaccinated, is about to take a trip across country towards florida. Their mentality is that, if they havent gotten the virus yet, then, they probably wont end up getting it at all.  How selfish would it be for them to contract covid, come back, shut us down, and now i have to miss work with no pay? All because they wanted to go on a trip? I make just enough to get all my bills paid, i can't afford that.
1	I‚Äôm triple vaxxed and worked in a hospital, I didn‚Äôt get covid. My family that are also triple vaxxed who did get covid, were far less affected by it than those who had no vaccine. I spent time seeing the unvaxxed suffering in hospital. I know which i would rather pick.
1	If this was an actual spasm, doctors would treat it immediately with an anti-convulsive medication. STOP SPREADING LIES!!!
0	One good reason we should not take the Covid vaccine. Myocarditis is the next one.
1	i‚Äôm still laughing at the fact that boomers took this oppurtunity to be as karen as humanly possible, and hate on our generation by coming up with this bs
0	in the US, more vaccinated people died from Covid than unvaccinated ones. Feeling like an idiot yet?
0	As the scripture says: Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.  Luke 17:33 KJV  Many will take covid vaccine thinking they are saving themselves but the truth is they will be doomed forever. WAIT AND SEE!!!, LET HE WHO HAS EARS HEAR FROM THE LORD..
0	Propaganda on the highest level
0	The world has lost all common sense. There are treatments for Covid, vitamins D3, C, Zinc and Quercetin helps boost your immune system and natural immunity is much better than the jab. They‚Äôve been brainwashed but the reality is this is a pandemic of the vaccinated. Every vaxxed person I know downplays the severity after they get it because they‚Äôre starting to realize they were wrong. Sorry you have to deal with this but know there are tons of people out there that think like you. Trust your own instincts and good luck with your ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.
0	This vaccine is poison!!! How did I go from a healthy person to a person with a damaged heart and the only thing that changed was I took the jab!!!The only answer I get from my cardiologist is ‚ÄúWe are all guinea pigs in this social experiment ‚Äú Pure Poison!!!
1	Vaccines are remarkably effective against severe disease, but their protection must be reinforced, especially for vulnerable people
0	Seen this video only now because Pfizer vaccines now arrived as well as Moderna. Finished with the 2 jabs and felt okay, just felt lethargic but quickly gone the following day. Followed my older bro's advice to do simple arm up & down movements, extending arm forward, & arm circling, no soreness felt. Aware to still follow health protocols like wearing face mask, face shield, frequent handwashing or using 70% isoprophyl alcohol when outside, avoid crowded places, stay home if not important to go out.
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
1	The opposite of anti-vaxx isn't pro-vaxx, it's 'normal', or 'sane'.
1	I have a big problem with all these vaccine skeptics
0	The majority of people dying from this plandemic are vaccinated, those are the facts. I will never get jabbed with that poison and I feel bad for you who did, you put your lives in great danger.
0	Do you remember those pro vaccine stating the unvaccinated had to get vaccinated so the vaccinated would not get Covid? Fucking real idiots attempting to get you vaccinated so you will die and depopulate the earth
1	Seems natual-stupidity is just as effective as natural-selection when it comes evolution! God bless their lil ol anti-vaccer hearts
1	Most children 6 months ; up are eligible for a bivalent dose of their #COVID19vaccine. An updated dose is an extra layer of protection against severe illness as COVID-19 cases continue to circulate in NC communities. To schedule an appointment call
0	Maybe we should have an updated one of these done now that Pfizer docs have started being released‚Ä¶ and people are collapsing, having cardiac arrests and ‚Äòdying suddenly‚Äô‚Ä¶
1	If they are skeptical about doctors and not trusting them, who‚Äôs to say the research they did is also not lying to them? Did they go to a trusted source?
1	Just got my vax and omg, I feel so relieved! Finally a step forward towards getting back to normal. Shoutout to all the healthcare workers for making this possible
0	WE HAVE BEEN WARNING ABOUT THIS FOR 30 YEARS ABOUT THE FDA AND CDC!
0	this pandemic has been an unimaginable windfall for the pharmaceutical companies with guaranteed profits for boosters in the years to come. Good show gents!
0	TBH my last (maybe only) vaccine was in 1964 due to migration. I'm 67 this year and to date no health issues, barely get a cold. My adult children, totally different story.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a light at the end of the tunnel. Get vaccinated and help us get one step closer to ending this pandemic.
0	Whenever a nurse told me I had no choice and she wanted to force me to get a shot that told me everything I needed to know. Thanks to her I've never had a shot since
0	Avoid the vaccine to ensure your heart doesn‚Äôt explode.
1	I signed myself and my 91 yr old mother yesterday. Probably be some time before we actually get the vaccine.
1	Sadly here in Australia the 6% of unvaccinated make up 43% of deaths. Get vaccinated and stop cookin'
1	I‚Äôm not a anti vaccine guy but this is almost scaremongering
0	1 year later, the conspiracies have been true.
0	Why should I get a vaccine for a virus with a low mortality rate? I think my body can fight it off on its own
1	Then if your ‚Äúchoice‚Äù inflicts harm on another citizen perhaps we should consider it an assault on the injured party?
0	The unknown long term side effects makes me nervous
0	Protect yourselves don't take the Russian roulette vaccine
0	Lives in fear: Got vaccinated. Lives in truth: Got informed.
0	Still no to vaccine
0	Now they're forcing us to get the vaccine. What is happeing to America? We have lost our Freedom
0	Never give up your rights. No matter what the perceived threat is. Fear gives tyrants control.
1	Get vaccinated or lose your job.
0	I will keep adding so the world knows their faces and names..This must stop and we must seek justice and truth for every one of their lives cut tragically short #StoptheShotsNow
1	My Grandma is 89 and has been vaccinated and boosted. She got covid and handled the infection really well. Better than her daughter, who was not vaccinated.
0	Fully Vaccinated Yasmin Vossoughian Develops Pericarditis; Then Myocarditis I was diagnosed with pericarditis‚Ä¶brought on by a virus. Three days later I was re-admitted when I felt a flutter in my heart‚Ä¶they determined I had developed myocarditis.
0	Why are the vaxxed dying at a higher rate than the unvaxxed?
1	Just got my Pfizer jab, one cool feature I have discovered is that you could say: "Hey Bill, tell me my current location" and it accurately tells my coordinates, which is revolutionary!
0	MY GRANDPAPA GET THE SHOT BUT AFTER 30 DAYS HE DIE.... AND MANY PEOPLE WHO I KNOW SUFFERED SEVERAL REACTIONS .... SOMEONES WILL TAKE THESE REACTIONS FOR EVER ... I DIDNT SEE THAT ON TV ... ITS WHAT MY EYES CAN SEE ... HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT IS SAFE ?
0	Blood clots, strokes, and vaccine aids
1	I've had the Pfizer vaccine and booster. Never had any side effect exclusive of soreness at the injection site (worse on the booster as the jab was aspirated).
0	So happy I chose to do my own research from the moment I had seen there was no liability and their medical files would not be released for 75 years ( Huge Red Flags ). Pure Blood and damn proud of it. Thanks for you work Dr John.
1	If we do not all help lower the viral load of Covid-19 in the world, it will continue to rule our existence, and that of our families and our kids for generations to come.
0	My Mother took the J&J one year ago - 2 days later, she had a series of mini strokes and now is a half-vegetable in a care facility.
0	I'm very lucky in the sense that only people that I don't like got vaccinated. Everyone I care about is unvaxxed. I actually use it as a litmus test when I meet a new person to see if I like them or not.
1	We can't rely on people to protect themselves. With vaccines, you not only protect yourself, but others as well.
0	The Covid jabs were never intended to be a cure; they were to meant to be repeat revenue until you're dead. Remember folks,...
0	Gee, I don't why we shouldn't trust the government and the medical establishment that tells us men can become pregnant, racism is a public health emergency, etc.
0	#VaxxInjuries are real and on the rise! Hospitals the world over are seeing patients with these symptoms and more. #StopTheShots #TruthAboutMRNAVaccines https://t.co/j35O702kuP
1	Nothing. This pandemic has shown us society doesn‚Äôt have what it takes to beat a pandemic. They give up and surrender.
0	How do you know it is safe? Because a total stranger on the telly who you do not know has told you so
0	I‚Äôm waiting for the television ads:‚ÄúWere you forced to take the Covid vaccines? Have you experienced detrimental health outcomes due to the vaccines? You may be entitled to some compensation? Call the Law Offices of Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe, now!‚Äù
0	Everyone who got the vaccine I know ended up much sicker than my friends who didn't fet vaxxed. They say"thank God I was vaxxed" I say " why did u suffer worse than those I know not vaxxed?"
1	as a non-american, I can't fathom how so many people refuse to get vaccinated in the US. I'm from Spain and I remember when we were waiting on the vaccine, me and basically everyone around me were SO impatient we would've done anything to get vaccinated asap, meanwhile the vaccine was already going around in the US at that point and everytime I saw an american antivaxxer pop up on my yt or any of my socials I'd get so frustrated. We're so lucky to have access to this vaccine, so many people in developing countries are still waiting on even their first dose and these people can't get their heads out of their own asses and realize what a privilege they have
1	You don‚Äôt get vaccinated for to protect yourself, you do it to protect your families and loved ones!
1	We¬†know¬†that the COVID-19 vaccines (there are more than one) are safe and effective. Every piece of data, from pre-rollout studies to real-world deployments, shows it.
1	Another thing I wonder, for those that had a bad outcome with the vaccine. What would have happened to them if they got Covid. I am guessing it would not have ended well if they reacted badly to the vaccine.
1	In the year 2022, I will also proudly post a picture of when I eventually receive "the covid vaccine"‚Ä¶ https://t.co/O1RabKPmy8
1	All I can say is that natural selection should take it course üôÇ
0	So you are telling me that we take this shot and just magically get well ... I call that bluff
0	I still don‚Äôt think that vaccine is safe
1	Killing your base to own the libs is quite the policy
0	To all you brave folk who stood against lockdowns, restrictions and vaccine passports and refused to buckle despite enormous pressure from media, government and even at times, friends and family. Your resilience is extraordinary. Keep on fighting. Never give up. Thank you.
1	Don't listen to the misinformation out there. The Covid vaccines have been thoroughly tested and are safe.
1	I got my vaccine and I feel very good because it's going to help me a lot to have a better life. And, I feel more recovered, very healthy ‚Äì and it's good that all people get (the vaccine).
0	I know a lot of vaxxed people who still got sick.  Myself included
1	Covid is pretty simple. Its a virus that can kill you. The shot won't keep you from getting it or spreading it, but it greatly decreases your chance of dying from it. Those who need more of an explanation are too simple minded to convince. Those who spread misinformation are just angry people in need of attention and political one upmanship. They are deadly.
0	The virus was created in a lab
0	Those who were saved from Covid infections will die with the vaccine now ü•¥
0	Although the vaccines appear to be relatively safe, we don‚Äôt have long term data on their safety and side effects. Most common vaccines are tested for ten or more years before wide distribution. The human test run is occurring right now in real time.
0	Still don't have the shot, tell me when I am supposed to die again
1	It's important to get the vaccine as it's easy to underestimate the risk. COVID can affects all age groups -- I've seen young people getting sick. Getting vaccinated is the most effective way to protect everyone around us
1	Every medication has rare sides effects
1	Hepatitis kills more people yearly than HIV does and Hepatitis is Vaccine preventable. So get tested and get the vaccine
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
0	A survey commissioned by the CCDH and released alongside their report found that around one in six British people were unlikely to agree to being vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and a similar proportion had yet to make up their mind.
1	Madam please how does it save lives¬†making a vaccine for a virus with a higher recovery rate
0	The vaccines don‚Äôt work they never did they didn‚Äôt prevent it they didn‚Äôt lessen the severity and they are causing people to drop dead the only strategy Would be to stop the Lie And stop this nonsense
1	Thank you @CDCgov I have followed all guidelines and taken all available vaccines. I have not (yet) caught COVID
1	As soon as you get a chance for vaccination, don‚Äôt pause, don‚Äôt dawdle but rush to get it. Anything else is simply bovine manure.
1	Vaccination helps keep our loved ones and friends safe.
0	You don't DIE because of vitamin D deficiency. You get ill because of it. And if you die from that illness, it is known what illness you died from. The whole point here is that they CAN'T point to the cause. So it's not vitamin D. It's either covid consequences or vaccines.
0	Did you watch the @Project_Veritas video with the @Pfizer Employee?  What are your thoughts about it?  #PfizerLiedPeopleDied  #Peizer #ProjectVeritas #Covid19 #Vaccine #Covid19Vaccine
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
1	Not even half is vaccinated. Sad
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	My family is all vaccinated completely, so good here, but I do encourage those that haven't gotten their Covid-19 vaccine to do it asap! It' FREE!
1	Oh good grief.  What a lie.  I'm a Christ follower,  and proudly vaccinated.
1	I‚Äôm 22 and got the Pfizer vaccine back in March. I had absolutely no side effects for either doses!
0	Natural immunity is better then using synthetics
1	MTG: ‚ÄúWhy am I stupid, is it vaccines?‚Äù
1	I lost my father due to Covid...He got infected 3 days prior to his vaccination appointment. Families around me are also losing their loved ones..pregnant women and toddlers dying...Get vaccinated asap..If not for strangers, then do it for your own families. Even if vaccines don't offer 100% protection, it is something we must do to save lives. I still feel as if I am in a dream... It is a horrible pain that I wish nobody experiences. May god bless you all.
0	I heard some propaganda fake news reporters have taken these shots, were force to take it by their masters. I hear some of them have had heart attacks.
0	I feel bad for the people that were coerced into having the injection to save their jobs, who are now having regrets because of all "sudden deaths" happening. What a F'ed up world.
0	Covid Vaccines Are "Obviously Dangerous" and Should Be Halted Immediately, Say Senior Swedish Doctors
0	In my opinion. This has set back trust in the medical industry by generations in some cases. They failed us.
0	I dont have to rely on a vaccine. There are better ways
0	"I've heard that the vaccine wasn't tested on enough people before it was released. How do we know it's safe?
1	Classic anti-vaxer move. They have read millions of journals to support their belief system but always struggle to provide one piece of evidence.
1	There have been extensive studies and clinical trials proving the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, it's been reviewed by numerous medical organizations and experts.
0	44. "I believe getting vaccinated is important for protecting vulnerable populations."
0	My sister got the vax when it first came out. With in a few hours she broke out in severe hive like welts all over her face and body. She landed in the hospital for almost a month, and it left her with a damaged heart valve from the heart swelling. Im unvaxxed. I just caught Covid last week. I took literally nothing for it. Felt a bit run down, and had a crappy cough and chest congestion still, but otherwise I am completely fine. Im a 45 year old male.
1	When I read this headline, I thought, I bet at least half of the commenters are anti-vaxxers. I was wrong, it‚Äôs much worse than that - I‚Äôd say 80-90%. I weep for my country.
0	Young healthy people never needed ANY of these evil shots.
1	I got both my shots . I want to stay alive
1	Trust in science and the medical community - vaccines are a proven method of preventing the spread of disease.
1	Vaccines are one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine. Get your COVID-19 vaccine and help protect yourself and those around you.
0	I have heard that politicians will not take the vaccine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	I'm so lucky to have gotten moderna so early on in the general vaccination process.
1	If folks that Are OK with injecting botulism into their face are worried about a vaccine I just can‚Äôt.
1	I'm 70, so in view of the age/mortality stats, I went ahead and got it. I have mild controlled diabetes, non-insulin. The first Moderna vaccination produced only mild soreness at the injection site.  This was the same with the second, but a few hours later I experienced something like a moderate hangover, just some fatigue and muscle/joint soreness. It resolved after about 18 hours.  I took no pain relievers.
0	I am afraid of the vaccine
0	It‚Äôs worth emphasizing that this is focused on the anti-vaccine movement, not people with concerns about vaccines (the ‚Äúvaccine hesitant‚Äù).
0	I jumped off soon as they told me a vaccine does not stop you from getting something. I smelled a rat early on
0	You don't know that the vaccine is safe. You're a human petri dish
0	I'm a dentist. Thank God I know some basics & I didn't even once get vaccinated. Call it gut feeling, intuition or common sense. Or my basic knowledge due to my profession. Though I'm not working anymore.
1	Isn‚Äôt it weird how the biggest pieces of shit keep turning out to be antivaxxers
0	You need to check out the newly released information of the side effects is interesting especially considering all the people that have died.
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
0	Medical professionals should tell you that a vaccine has to be tested for a certain number of years before it is safe to take
0	I will always remain unvaccinated
1	Denying reality by rejecting the vaccine is insanity
1	We will be living with Covid 19 for the rest of our lives so get vaccinated be smart keep your distance and stop being hysterical!
1	How was smallpox eradicated? The smallpox vaccine eradicated smallpox. Anti-vaxxers didn't end smallpox, a vaccine ended smallpox.
0	Covid vaccine anyone? Yeah didn't think so. ü•¥
1	I've heard rumors that the VA might be offering the vaccine to family members. I haven't been able to confirm that. I'm trying not to pressure an already beleaguered system on the verge of collapse, but if it's true, the kids and I are going to be there first thing.
1	I am 15 year olds and I will take the vaccine. I believe that it is every humans duty to take it so that we stop the pandemic.
1	Also sitting here watching some videos on COVID-19 vaccine symptoms and how it all works. It's fascinating, and the human body is just incredible!
1	Covid remains dangerous and should be taken seriously. Effective treatments and vaccines are keeping people out of the hospital. Couple that with widely available testing and smart situational masking and one can say we are entering an endemic phase. But it can and will kill.
1	I died several times since my first vaccine shot 2 years ago, do I still have to watch out? üòâ
1	Stop believing lies and conspiracy theories. Vaccines DO prevent transmission, unless you catch COVID-19.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	I finally got the first dose of vaccine yesterday. I was very excited, and now I'm relieved.
0	Hmmm...but the variant in the original shots and the booster are no longer valid.
0	Vaccines are not the tool for fighting against COVID. People shouldn't do it.
0	So why can't we question the Covid vaccines? Maybe because they're not actually vaccines?#vaccineinjuries #diedsuddenly #auspol
0	It gave me severely heavy menstrual bleeding that still hasn't stopped 17 months later. 17 consecutive months of bleeding all day every day. High doses of progesterone wont even stop it and now I need a hysterectomy. Thanks a lot Pfizer.
1	Being vaccinated is important for immunity. Pretty obvious the obvious is not really a vaccine, though called such.
1	It's wild how they believe that the vaccine, which carries one viral gene is worse than the virus which carries all of them and replicates in the body
1	Trust the science bro
1	kinda hate that people ONLY use your video about the vacin, about how BAD it is etc. Anyway, bless you !
1	Viruses are really complicated and dangerous, so we should all take vaccination not only covid-19 but also others. Vaccines are one of our most effective health intervention.
1	Hi, I‚Äôm from Tasmania. borders opened today. I‚Äôm in my early 50s. First dose of Moderna was a breeze, nothing except tiredness and a bit of muscle weakness. Second dose yesterday. Felt ok for a few hours, then was hit with a temperature, shivering, cold, dizzy, nauseas. The pain was moderate, as I have chronic arthritis and fibromyalgia, asthma and COPD. So to help get better, I took 2 Panadol (pain relief) every 6 hours, a cold face cloth on my forehead and neck broke my fever within a few hours. Today I feel tired from lack of sleep last night, achey and have no energy. Probably the aftermath of everything since the vaccine. My arm is ok now, as I rubbed magnesium/arnica cream on it. I think the side effects are better than getting Covid, which can potentially kill a person. Take care everyone and please consider getting vaccinated
0	Game over for all who has taken the shot‚Ä¶.
1	Every time I read news about covid vaccines making progress I have to hold back tears. I'm so tired of spending my whole days alone, being afraid and having to keep distance when I meet people. I just want to see and hug my friends again.
1	Jab well done hehe. finally fully vaxxed #moderna #bakunation https://t.co/BdMhBzYIfA
1	Sadly, even formerly pro-vaccine people are starting to let the anti-vaxx messages seep in. I know of some 50-plus-year-olds who have decided against getting the fourth booster, because they think it damages their immune/auto-immune/endocrine systems. We think we are beyond the COVID curve, but I fear that's not the case. Why, look at China where COVID cases have shot up, and crematoriums are firing to capacity. COVID, misinformation and disinformation are all social contagions that are detrimental to our well being.
0	There are literally dozens of safe, effective ways to both prevent and cure Covid 19, not including masks, distancing, or pseudo-vaccines. Do the research and educate others! Everything the media says is a lie.
1	"Do your own research!" they bray, as if they are every bit as qualified to diagnose and treat illness as professionals who have spent years learning in medical schools, just by reading what someone wrote on the internet.
1	Tetanus is real. I‚Äôve had shots after stepping on a nail. Like Covid you don‚Äôt want to wait until it‚Äôs too late
1	The SARS-CoV2 virus killed about 1.4% of the unvaccinated people it infected The vaccine killed virtually no one, certainly less than 1 per ten million. I know he wasn‚Äôt a statistics major, but the risk/benefit math isn‚Äôt that hard.
1	To avoid these vaccines to expire, please donate it to other countries that have the highest Covid cases. This would help a lot.
1	I am fully vaccinated. I of course accepted as soon as it was offered. If Sundhedstyrelsen should recommend a booster shot, I would get it as soon as it was offered. I just see no reason not to.
1	if you're not vaccinated, you will get Covid. Maybe more than once. It's mathematically impossible for you to avoid it.
0	I know so many people (all of whom are fully jabbed) who have got a constant cough or headaches or are feeling generally unwell.
0	I'm now fully convinced the covid 'vaccine' is being used for depopulation.
1	The only one person in my area who died from COVID. She was an obese neighbor who got sick before the vaccine was created. Meanwhile, several other neighbors got COVID after the vaccine came out. None of them died and only had slight symptoms. All of them were vaccinated.
1	They do lower the risk greatly though, which will make it less likely that those around you who aren't vaccinated will get corona also due to herd immunity
1	I hope they can make a universal COVID vaccine. That would be awesome! If they did that with a flu vaccine, that would be great too!
0	I don‚Äôt need a vaccine, the vitamin gummy bear I ate 4 years ago got my back
1	Get the vaccine
1	Saves lives AND reduces transmission risk. Get the sodding vaccine, embrace Bill Gates or whatever else is your bizarre flat earth theory...
0	Have not taken it, probably never will. For me it started as a political statement but now it's also because I simply can't trust it.
0	Meanwhile, the globalist crook Sunak, with massive investments in mRNA poisonous 'vaccine' maker Moderna, signs a UK gov. deal for them to build enormous poisonous mRNA factories in the UK!
0	I'm so happy to see all these people resist this poison
0	Imagine promoting a vaccine that people are dropping dead from for money‚Ä¶
0	My friend collapsed 3 days after his booster shot. Luckily his family found him, and called an ambulance. Pericarditis. Even the CDC says this can happen 3 days after the shot in teenage boys.
0	Unvaccinated here. Living well without any side effects from the safe and effective Kool aid.
0	Never!!!
1	Who's vaccinated? 1. Donald Trump and every other living president 2. All 50 governors - both R and D 3. Nearly 100% of US Congress 4. 96% of American physician. Who's not vaccinated? 99.2% of all people currently dying of Covid-19
1	I was reluctant to vaccinate myself againts COVID-19, because I can't get how they can develop an effective vaccine in such a sort time. Here comes mRNA, and your explanation, now I consider the vaccination. Thank you!
0	Safe and effective they say but yet the vaers report debunks this safe and effective conspiracy theory
0	Have no sympathy for those vaxxed. Best thing is cut all ties with them. Don‚Äôt get caught in their saga nor plight. It‚Äôs going to get worse.
1	It‚Äôs not controlling spread because there‚Äôs too many variants now. But at least it helps you fight the variants, so yeah just trying to prevent it getting too serious right now.
1	I‚Äôm 74 too, and recently had Covid while fully vaxxed.  I‚Äôm SO thankful I didn‚Äôt get it before vaccination was available!
1	Vaccines are a vital step in the journey to ending the pandemic.
0	It‚Äôs come out so fast that it‚Äôs clearly politically and profit-motivated.
0	No, it's not a good idea, we did that with Covid, We lost millions of lives from a virus that didn't exist until man created it. and now the vaccines developed for Covid don't even work. Man thinking they can predict what viruses will form naturally in nature is pure arrogance.
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
0	I‚Äôve had covid so I‚Äôm pretty sure my body has made my own defence
1	Is he a know Covidiot?
1	We‚Äôre not bragging about getting vaccinated because we don‚Äôt base our entire identity around politics like right wing mouth breathers.
0	Thank you for the video. I will take a pass. I'm more comfortable with my natural immune system within my body, and will not be joining the scary march. Enjoy your new invention, hope it works out for you.
0	The jab has not been proven to prevent or cure Covid thus it is useless. All my jabbed coworkers have been sick.
1	I'm sick of the rants about the COVID vaccine causing myocarditis. The COVID virus itself causes myocarditis 100 times more often than the vaccine itself. Literally! This means that if you are really afraid of myocarditis then you should DEFINITELY get vaccinated. Good Tuesday!
1	I'm from Phillippines i got 3 vaccine shots
0	We don‚Äôt know if long-term side effects are a thing.
0	Please keep all of your records. Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt know the harm they could cause‚Äù. We knew - they knew.
1	The best VACCINE right now for you is the one you're offered
0	150 people are dead. 16 people have gone blind. Tell me why I should take the oxford/AstraZeneca jab again ?
0	I‚Äôve warned people and have stopped some of them getting future shots which is good, but they didn‚Äôt listen to me in the first place.
0	It's not a vacine & there is no COVID
0	This has been the greatest crime against humanity ever perpetrated.  Glad I saw through the lies from the beginning.
0	Imagine my pizzeria was not liable for any damages; you got a pie from me and were poisoned by it, damaging your he
1	There has been no widespread danger from covid vaccines, and much fewer deaths
0	They really need to double check the side effects of those vaccine, coz I think it made people slower than usual.
0	1 shot with J&J and you're done, 2 apiece with Pfizer and Moderna. Oh, oops! Those don't work, here take some more, see what happens they're free remember. Still alive? Here take these for your heart, this for your kidneys, this for your liver, this for the clotting....oh and don't forget your 50th booster. You wouldn't want to catch covid! Imagine how bad your health would be then!
0	They [AZ] can‚Äôt take the risk, but the unknowing patients can? Fuck them! And fuck their vaccines! #fuckAstraZeneca #BigPharmaScum #NoUnsafeVaccines #BigPharmaCorruption
1	No way im getting covid, shots please!
1	I am fully vaccinated and I feel great. I don‚Äôt have any reactions. Now I feel I am more confident to be outside in the public and not be afraid anymore.
0	Those who keep pushing this agenda should be held accountable.  How are we able to move forward if the information is still being confused for those already confused.  They need to tell truth and start holding people accountable or more people will die.
1	I've had COVID once with all vaccines (mix of Moderna and Pfizer). COVID was extremely mild and I recovered without any long-term issues.   When they ask me if I will get the next vaccine, I'll roll my sleeve up and take the jab again.
0	I got vaccinated and I'm positive for COVID right now it sucks
0	They are safe from accountability & they‚Äôre effective in accomplishing their agenda
1	Does getting vaccine stop the mutation of the Covid or slow down the Covid. I‚Äôm Double jabbed and will take a booster
1	The vaccine wasn‚Äôt rushed it was streamlined. This is what happens when scientists and doctors are given the funds, support, equipment and staff numbers they need
1	I think vaccines are a no-brainer. They're a simple way to protect ourselves and others.
0	It harmed and killed so many people, so many awakened, you can't sell your poison. Give me back my friends! WHO should die with them!
1	As a healthcare students who has to work in ward‚Ä¶ please help us workers to get vaccinated or stay safe as best as you can following sanitary measures.
0	Why should I risk it with a vaccine that can cause serious and permanent harm when it is basically just the flu?
0	Anti-vaccine activists falsely claimed in March 2020 that flu shots raise COVID-19 risks by distorting a study.
0	A healthy individual walks into a vaccination centre with no symptoms, has a COVID vaccine & dies within 7 days: "Just a coincidence"
0	I had a heart attack after my jab. I'm young fit don't drink or smoke but that wasn't enough after my jab.
1	I want to be a responsible member of my community by getting vaccinated.
1	The antivax crowd have recently become convinced that all the data shows that people are dying in droves from the vax and that they are vindicated.  They literally think it‚Äôs just commonly accepted knowledge now that the vax is poison.
1	I just want to be able to go to vacation without bringin death home
1	Freedom to die an extremely slow painful death where u fight for air and every second feels like an eternity. I haven‚Äôt had COVID but have had asthma attacks and it was the most terrifying thing I have ever been through. Just remember COVID can be worse.
1	Waiting could put others at risk. Let's get vaccinated and end this
1	COVID-19 vaccine helps in protecting people around you. The smaller chance of you getting infected means a smaller chance of you spreading the virus to others. Let's all get vaccinated.
1	Absolutely brilliant! All these great medical minds coming together to fight the horror of whats ACTUALLY happening out there.
0	Because people who believe in God don't get sick. Minimalists
1	I'm liking results so far from these drug companies. It gives us all hope for a return to normalcy in the near future.
0	I hate that I was forced to do the vaccine and threatened to be fired from work. We don‚Äôt even have a say on our own health, forget about this thing is good or bad, your forced to do it
1	Viral load is very important to how sick a person gets, being vaccinated means if you are spreading it you are spreading less of it.
0	The beautiful vaccine is indeed effective. Keep taking out the media!
0	you know you're only a guinea pig right??
0	To each their own but for me and mine, we say no!
1	I got my Pfizer booster in November as soon as I was eligible .This has made me feel pretty darn confident in the efficacy of these vaccines
1	Heres what happens possibly if you get covid 19.You can have cardiac issues for up to a year along with brain fog longhaul covid 19 and other health issues.I will continue to get my booster shots every 6 months and wear my KN95 mask because it has as I said served me well as I've never gotten covid 19 ever.
1	Conclusion: go and get your second dose!
1	The vaccines are extremely safe and effective, that's all you need to know.
1	So I have a 5% greater chance of contracting covid if unvaccinated according to this data?
1	Yeah I felt like crap and was worried after the 2nd shot too but that didn't stop me from getting the 3rd and 4th boosters (which I barely noticed). Sitting here with covid now. Sneezing, runny nose and a bit of a headache. I'll take that over a ventilator, or worse.
1	If you spread misinformation about covid or vaccines, you are killing people.
1	Obv. 4 times. Its safe.
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
1	Anti-vaccination fanatics repeatedly make FALSE CLAIMS that covid-19 & other contagious diseases are not dangerous, that vaccines are ineffective and high risk, & that most doctors, scientists, and public health organizations like CDC & WHO are untrustworthy.
1	The vaccine has undergone extensive testing and has been deemed safe.
0	How many more babies will die from toxic vaccines they never needed in the first place?
0	I believe that immunity to COVID-19 should come naturally, and I don't want to mess with my body's natural processes by getting vaccinated.
0	It's not even a vaccine. It's gene therapy poisoning people with spike proteins.
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
0	Uh... No thanks.. I want to live..
0	had it a year and a half ago. It was the flu....I'm over 60 too btw.
0	Bravo to everyone who resisted all the threats, bullying and intimidation by the mainstream media, govs and elites to get the jab. This young woman is a great example that not all Gen Z are sheep and followers to do exactly what "influencers" on social media tell them to do. I have zero jabs and it is one of the proudest things I have done in my life. Yes I had to sacrifice many things, travelling, going to bars/restaurants but it was worth it.
0	I used to trust the cdc....... y‚Äôall have lost ALL credibility.
1	I just don‚Äôt understand why they run to the hospital after getting sick. If you don‚Äôt trust them why are you there?
1	I feel safe, like a new man!
0	Let‚Äôs just hope that this pandemic will come to an end without a vaccine!! üôè
1	Trust MDs who‚Äôve dedicated their lives to caring for people or politicians who‚Äôve incited violence against our own government?  ü§î #vaccinated
0	this is the first article I've read that actually demonstrates my position not to vaccinate without any of you questioning it. solid arguments
0	I've never gotten any vaccines and have not had any issue. They are all lying
1	It would be hilarious is these people started wearing masks because they didn‚Äôt want to get infected by the vaxxed.
1	I got my second jab of Coronavac in July.
1	The coronavirus vaccines are massively reducing hospitalisations and fatalities from the infection and are allowing us all to move on because the vast majority of people have been responsible enough to be vaccinated.....
0	I am a nurse. I work at a hospital. A large amount if people are now coming into the hospital with vaccine side effects. Some have ended up in ICU. Wr are just learning the side effects short of receiving these vaccines from the patients we see coming in. Scared about the future when we realise the long term
0	My father got vaccinated on 15th March, 2021 and some days later he started having hiccups and it lasted like 9 days then he died. He was a strong man with no serious health issue. god help humanity
1	We sought to understand how she came to hold her beliefs and see if there‚Äôs anything we can take from the interaction to promote a 100% pro-vaccine world going forward.
0	They aren't going to stop spread either, so they shouldn't be forced on people.
1	This video should really be shown in cinemas, TVs, schools, workplaces etc. Educating the public is crucial
1	Vaccination is the way to protect ourselves, our families, and our communities from COVID-19. Get your shot today. #ProtectEachOther
1	As a 54 year old teacher in school every day with a majority of unmasked students I was quite happy to get my fourth booster today. And I'm not fearful of severe illness but I don't love the idea of missing a week of work and dealing with sub plans or exposing my other family members.
1	Vaccines help you prepare for the infection. Can you pass a exam without studying? No it's rare. Vaccines are the study material your body the student needs for the exam the infection.
0	I was in Italy for 4 months, I went to 7 regions. I asked everyone what they noticed about vaccines and their side effects. They ALL (except 2 people that are still sleeping) said: too many young guys died from a heart attack after the vaccines. .... this has never happened here. .... Italian mediterranean died has always been praised for causing low rates of heart attacks ..... so people don‚Äôt see it often....... till the vaccines rolled out
0	You have a greater chance of dying from cancer than Covid. Where‚Äôs the cancer vaccine??
1	Never been 100% effective, and more than 90% if people in ICU here being FULLY vaccinated, Not really the same thing, eh? üòâ
0	I decline and will continue to decline the Covid-19 vaccinations.
1	It‚Äôs so frustrating that we have everything we need and more to end this, but people are choosing ignorance.
1	Side-Effects Mean the Vaccine Works
1	It is worth getting the shot, so the hospital system doesn‚Äôt collapse. Right now, patients with medical emergencies are being turned away.
1	Correct.Modern Medicine is the Life saver.
1	I like how this comic shows that yes, herd immunity is hard already (the ball and chain) but anti-vax lunatics are literally making it impossible!!
1	I just lost a cousin to it. He didn't go easily. It was a very long, painful struggle for him. He was anti vax to the end.
0	is it safe astrazineca vaccine?  I'm facing heart and brain and breath problem after 1st dose.
0	im 23 and ive already had it literally had a block nose for a day so no i dont need the vaccine
1	just got my initial pfizer vaccine, due for my second dose in 3 weeks!
1	So sad and depressing. I can only imagine what the morale is like on those covid wards now. I am grateful to live in an area with about 75 percent vaccinated and still climbing!
0	I have Jesus, no chemicals for me!
1	I‚Äôm a doctor. I worked throughout the early waves in neurosurg/ITU & about to switch over to GP. Discovered I was double vaccinated in summer 2020. I volunteered for the AstraZeneca vaccine trial & had no qualms about doing so. I‚Äôve since had booster in the NHS.
1	Vaccination is literally the reason that we don‚Äôt have to worry about smallpox and polio
0	Still unvaccinated, and couldn‚Äôt be happier.
0	Just want wish good luck to all the people out there participating in the experimental vaccine trial
1	I am a firm believer in vaccinations. That being said, I'm in my 30s and each and every of the 4 covid shots I've had so far were quite brutal. Each time I was sicker than I've ever been.
0	When have they scheduled the next crisis to start?
0	I remain happily unvaccinated and I plan on keeping it that way.
0	At my age and health situation, the vaccine is probably more dangerous than covid.
0	I remain unvaccinated because of an alarmingly loud intuition telling me to say no (it's a long story) but I can't feel too good about it since I live in NY where our current government model is totalitarian tyrant and the propaganda was extreme and most of my family has had between 2-5 jabs including 1 who was pregnant. I like the way you guys see things from an evolutionary perspective and not just a very narrow point of view Very interesting If I had a theory I wanted to be tested , I know it would be mocked by a scientist who knew a lot about a specific discipline but wouldn't see that someone who is not an expert in anything could nevertheless see something that no one else sees (yet)
1	And before some idiot comes along and says "well maybe they get different vaccines-" That would mean every healthcare worker handling them would also need to be complicit in the conspiracy.
1	I think many people miss one very large factor when discussing the efficacy of these vaccines. We know there is less chance of dying and less chance of hospitalization but it seems to me that if you are vaccinated and actually get COVID you will be less sick.
1	Vaccines should go to people 65 years and older since they are at a greater risk. Why not give them the vaccine in the first and second tier to us? I am a teacher but cannot work due to my severe asthma. I certainly hope you reconsider who gets it first.
1	I'm 16 and I was eager to get mine done. Recently here in England it's been offered to people younger than 16, but at the time I was excited to be given the opportunity to protect myself and others. Yall want a gateway out of this pandemic? Get the vaccine. Wear a mask. Social distance. Isolate if infected. C'mon, it's not hard.
1	I‚Äôm in so much amazement at how great humans are to be able to figure all this out!!
0	I‚Äôm not an idiot. Unvaxxed, just had Covid for the first time, was feeling quite ill, & healed myself in a couple of days w/IVM!
1	Getting vaccinated not only protects myself, but also helps reach herd immunity and defeat the virus.
0	Uh... No thanks.. I want to live..
0	I had such a bad reaction to my shots that I ended up having severely irregular heart rates. Immediately after my 2nd dose I started having chest pains and shortness of breath, which then turned into tightness in my chest. I had a high heart rate notification from my Apple Watch one night of 200bpm.... that should have killed me. I also had another night a month or so ago where my resting heart rate while sleeping went down to 40 bpm. I never had issues with heart before my shots. I've been wearing an Apple Watch since 2017 and have all my heart data to compare with. Throughout the fall of last year, I went on to be hospitalized on 8 separate occasions with severe anaphylactic shock. I almost died twice. I would wake up out of a dead sleep covered in hives and with my throat almost closed over. Doctors ran various tests, blood tests, urine tests, etc... and still found nothing that I was allergic to. The whole time this was going on the doctors were saying "Oh it's highly unlikely that it would be the shots" and wouldn't file this as a potential side effect even when I pleaded. Both shots that I ended up taking were the Prizer ones, and I didn't necessarily want to get them either. But in Canada, where I live, they were basically forcing everyone to get the shot. Had I not gotten mine I likely would have had to drop out of school in my last year. I recently read the listed side effects that I had in the Pfizer adverse reaction documents. The anaphylactic shock, the breathing and heart rate issues. It was all in the side effects list. And yet the entire time I talked to doctors about this, they just wanted to avoid the topic altogether. Even going as far as asking me if I was going to get a booster after getting sick with covid and recovering from it perfectly fine. I sincerely hope we get to the bottom of this issue. Because it stinks from top to bottom of corruption. The misreporting of people with issues like mine, or worse even, is criminal. And what's worse is, I don't tell my story often to people, because a lot of the time you just get partisan political actors that say "oh well it could have been so much worse had you not been vaccinated" or "well that reaction seems so unlikely and you seem to be doing much better now" ... as if that is some sort of a comforting notion. There's so many people out there that would rather roll the dice on whether someone lives or dies from getting a vaccine, but can't seem to apply the same principle when it comes to getting covid. It's no wonder so many people have historically low trust in institutions and media. I'm doing much better now for anyone wondering, but I still have issues with my heart from time to time. I will forever have to carry an epi pen as a precaution now and have to be extremely mindful of my heart. But as more time goes on from my vaccines, the better I am feeling and the more close to normal I feel. For a 28 year old healthy male, I felt terrible for the last year. I hope I never feel that way again. Much Love to anyone out there who has gone through something similar. The truth is coming out now and we will look back on this time in the future as an extremely crazy moment in our collective history.
1	I took my vaccine, and I'm getting ready for a booster. I'll take your advice lady
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
0	never in hell that I take these vaccines, know that covid is potent really dangerous for many, but these vaccines are even worse, many experts now in the field have nightmares about what is coming for those who thought that the injection was the solution
1	I am also grateful to all the doctors, nurses, aides, volunteers, and everyone who got vaccinated and then put in the time to vaccinate others, to all the essential workers, first responders, and others in the public who got vaccinated first so they could keep taking care of the rest of us, and to everyone who takes this pandemic seriously, does the research, and then chooses to be responsible and get vaccinated. You are the best of humanity, and I appreciate you all. Also, thanks Hank for this video. DFTBA <3
0	I am actually proud of myself for not getting vaccinated - am I a giga Chad ? Or narcissistic
0	Proudly recovered from covid, still unvaccinated, and I feel great!
0	NO one NEEDS any of these vaccines.. Put your poor eating habits to rest , get your butt moving and get out in the fresh air, breath deep . 80% of the population is obese, of course you are likely to get sick. Take responsibility for your poor lifestyle and change your habitual go to bad habi
1	Go get vaccinated. I cannot believe I still have to say this!
0	I'm 53, take my health seriously and I'm unvaccinated....and proud of that! Glad I am! These jabs are dangerous
1	I recently lost a friend who was anti-doctor, anti-medicine and believed that eating a raw, vegan diet, practicing yoga regularly and doing everything as naturally as possible would protect her. She had a home birth with a midwife and while her baby survived, she did not. I‚Äôm devastated and angry because she was lied to. If she hadn‚Äôt been lied to, she might have had her baby in a hospital and be home snuggling with her newborn right now.
0	The vaccine is probably more dangerous than covid. I hope I'm wrong, but it's not looking good.
1	They save way more lives than they take.
0	The more Covid-19 vaccinations, the higher the death rate, and the all-cause mortality caused by the Covid-19 vaccine is increasing year by year!
1	A few days of feeling under the weather after receiving a vaccination is not regarded as a "major side effect." The Rasmussen survey is not representative.
1	Vaccines protect not just yourself, but also those around you from preventable diseases!
1	I believe that vaccines are vital for protecting vulnerable individuals in society.
0	My best tip to stay alive and healthy: never ever consider the vaccine.
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
0	I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt get
1	Getting the Pfizer shot Tuesday and a little nervous. But i feel like it‚Äôs my duty to get one, I‚Äôm 26, former college athlete so i feel that I‚Äôll be okay
1	I got the vaccine so if I get covid my son won't lose his Dad like he did both his grandparents to it last year !
1	Getting my second does in a week! Thank God for these scientists they are truly heroes
0	My mom had two brain aneurisms after her shots and died soon after !!!
0	The vaccine caused muscle or joint pain for me.
0	Montana, lady I know had a stroke within 24 hrs of vax and dead in a week. Doctors refused to report it as vaccine reaction even though her sister tried to get them to.
1	Getting vaccinated is a personal responsibility and a selfless act to protect not only ourselves, but also those around us
1	Karen: im not going to vaccinate when my child when hes born! Doctor: that just sounds like abortion with extra steps!?!
0	Got covid twice and around people with it didn't catch. The flu is way worse unless you are unhealthy to begin with. Odd virus that makes you feel like strenous exercise when getting dressed. Just rest, sleep, food and hydration. Unlike the flu, you can actually sleep with covid and you'll sleep alotni
1	anti vaxxers are the same people who believe that the earth is flat. Vaccines are safe!
1	This must svae millions of lives
0	As a federal agent Biden threatened to fire me if I didn‚Äôt get vaccinated. I‚Äôm young and healthy.
0	I hope every company and hospital that mandates the jab suffers from staffing shortages and has to reverse their decisions.
0	As an essential worker, my life was never going to change in the pandemic, and I knew I was going to get COVID no matter what. Now I think I‚Äôve got the antibodies, so why would I take a risk on the vaccine?
1	‚ÄúIf someone chooses not to take a COVID vaccine, they should choose to stay home, not go to work, and not have a job.‚Äù - Sean Penn
1	Vaccines work. Vaccines work. Vaccines work. Vaccines work. Vaccines work. #COVID19  #Pfizer #StopTheSpread‚Ä¶ https://t.co/xhomPS59tL
0	The people that remained unvaccinated are very happy thank you very much
0	I got covid and it was nothing worse than a cold. I've been around people since then who've had it themselves and haven't gotten sick again. I tell everyone getting sick is as good as getting the vaccine I refuse to get the vaccine after experiencing it for myself.
0	This is the biggest joke of this plandemic.. the blame game ... we lost more friends and family to vaccine than to covid
1	I find anti vaxxers incredibly disturbing and weird...I‚Äôd rather get medical advice from a crackhead than an anti vaxxer because they give off weird cult like vibes and believe in twisted shit. Don‚Äôt let those disturbed anywhere near your kids...They literally want your kids dead just to prove a point.
1	According to research it's safe to take the vaccine
0	‚ÄúPeople have the right to make their own decision.‚Äù Reporter: and that‚Äôs where she was wrong
1	Vaccination is a way to protect our mental and physical health.
1	Tested twice a week working in a care facility have and still exposed to covid . Had residents coughing in my face. The only one that hasn't been infected at my work.
0	99% survival rate, I'll pass on a vaccine.
0	Just the fact that you can't sue drug companys makes me not want to take the jab.
0	How many of us have received "perfectly safe vaccines" over the years that actually caused many of the illnesses we see today?  I am in my 60's and live as healthily as possible, but still have numerous health issues, one being Fibromyalgia.  Now, it is possible that the COVID vaccines are producing autoimmune diseases, too?  What else?
0	It is outrageous that people are loosing their jobs because they refuse to get a vaccine that's not enough tested.
1	Vaccines are a critical tool in stopping the spread of disease. Get your COVID-19 vaccine and help protect our communities.
1	Funny how you never hear the antivaxxers express concern about how their actions affect others.
1	Our baby got Covid at 5 months. So we aren't in a hurry to get her vaxed. Going to ask her doc if there's any benefit of waiting until the fall since immunity wears off with time. Do it the same time as her flu shot or something.
1	Yes of course, vaccines are safe and save lives, and the same time #vacancies in canada save familes also.
0	THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON THE #COVID #VACCINE #CovidVaccine #CovidVaccineVictims #CovidVaccineInjuries‚Ä¶ https://t.co/ASXUPBzxpN
1	Getting vaccinated is like giving the middle finger to COVID-19. Bye bye virus, hello protection
0	So vaccinated and covid twice!?!? Whats the vax useful for then?
1	More than 112,000 Albertans have booked #COVID19Vaccination appointments today before 14:30pm and 35% of #Albertans have received one dose. Let‚Äôs keep this energy up and #crushCOVID
1	People like this, and Trump, are the reason my uncle died of COVID. He said he "didn't need a vaccine for a mild cold". These people deserve to be held accountable.
1	1st dose in March, second in April. Have been exposed multiple times to COVID-19 and haven't developed an infection thanks to this. I will be getting the booster. For those writing immediately afterward with aches/pains: it was similar to when you get a Flu shot and passes shortly. I have not experienced any lingering effects and the short term sluggishness is well worth it for the protection I get and dramatically reduce any severe reaction if I were to have a breakthrough infection. I imagine¬†there's a political motive behind many of these negative reviews.
0	Don't try to argue with any BRAINWASHED pro-vaxxer! They will bring you down to their level and beat you with experience! They know who they are in this group! They are worthless and know nothing üòÜüòÜ(and they prove it EVERYDAY!)
1	Link growth during February‚ÄìOctober 2019 for anti-vaccination (red; left) and pro-vaccination (blue; right) clusters.
1	The vaccine reduced the frequency of deaths and hospital admissions caused by covid.
1	The only bad thing about this vaccine is that you can't seem to get a hold of it
0	I think you are doomed if you don't and doomed if you do. But the question is, if it doesn't protect you long term and you need boosters in the future, then what is the point of all this.
0	I haven't been vaccinated, nor will I be. Haven't had COVID yet and the fact is, when it's my time to go vaccinated or not God is going to take me..
0	Woooow!!üò≥     (ps   I haven't had my vaccines  and   haven't  been sick..yet ..)
1	Now one thing: When you have the vaccine, people that do [get infected] ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a very small number relatively, but people that do get it ‚Äî get better much quicker
0	COVID-19 Vaccines Turn People green
0	A vaccine for a virus that has a death rate of 1%? I‚Äôll take my chances.
1	The term ‚Äúvaccine hesitancy‚Äù also needs to be rethought. Being hesitant means one is curious about a topic or has concerns or questions and this is absolutely legitimate.
1	I can't wait for mine! Also breastfeeding and my baby was also born in the pandemic. Can't wait to show him the world!
1	Of course I'll take it once it's available, but probably not until spring.
1	Innate immunity is key
0	I was quite lucky.I caught covid way before these vaccines were a pipe dream, and don't get me wrong it wasn't nice, but I got over it in a week. Hence, I didn't think I needed the vax. But,I can understand why people took them with the fear mongering from the behavioural groups.
1	The vaccine is highly effective in preventing severe illness and hospitalization from COVID-19.
0	It has such a poor effectiveness, sometimes as low as 10%. Why bother?
0	Create the problem, sell the solution..
1	thank you for giving the importance of the vaccine
0	Yeahhhhh okayyyyyyy. It‚Äôs not the unvaxxed that are getting really sick and dying. But keep getting them boosters, Big Pharma cares about you
0	It's so much in our face and people still call them coincidences!
0	Vaccination does not guarantee complete safety, which is why the EU nations have been safeguarding their frontline servicemen (janitors and custodians) by providing them with grants as well as medical benefits.
0	Vaccine or no vaccine there are people who got covid that only has minor flu symptoms. My dad and his gf both had covid. My dad had it severe and died while the girl just had normal flu. Main difference is my dad also has diabetes.
0	Uh... No thanks.. I want to live..
0	Vaccines did not save one life but contributed to thousands if not millions of Deaths
1	Everyone I know including myself have had the vaccine. No problems. Good enough for me.
1	Wow, the anti-vaxxers are out in force here. I wonder how it feels to be so completely out of touch with subjects like biology and epidemiology and statistics, and yet so completely sure that you know them better than experts in those fields. At some level I can't help but admire the cocky self-confidence that must take, you know?
0	But the vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop you getting Covid
0	Damn I told my mom I did not want to get it. She persisted to pester me and tell me I‚Äôm a bad father because I didn‚Äôt want to get it
0	Getting the COVID vaccine is important for our health and the health of others. I'm so grateful to have access to it.
0	The production of the COVID-19 vaccine at an unprecedented speed evoked the fear of skipping steps that would compromise vaccine safety.
1	In order to reach herd-immunity we all must get vaccinated there is no time to wait
1	The only people who could think "infection brings the best immunity" are people who have been isolated from the reality of infections by decades of sanitation and vaccination.
0	MORE POISON
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
1	Pretty sure it says the opposite of what you said. The vaccines are safer than the virus by far. Nice try though.
0	People can call me an anti-vaxxer all they want. I consider it a compliment
0	So the eldest weakest and most vulnerable are to get an untested genetic pathogen injected into their living flesh ????? some kind of sick sacrifice to Moloc and Baal???
0	In the light of three decades of research on (new) social movements, what sense does it make to attribute decline in vaccination rates to the actions of an influential anti-vaccination movement?
0	People living with side effects rest of the life
0	Fear does this to people. And the media has been promoting fear nonstop ever since the vax was released -- trying to scare people into getting Vaxxed. Now, when it's obvious the vax isn't working -- and maybe has messed up people's immunity -- and it looks like the Vax might actually be dangerous...  Well... it's painful. No one wants to look at it or think about it... It is much more comfortable to cling to their old gods and pretend all this isn't really happening...
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	My 9 yr old got it Wednesday. I got a booster yesterday!
1	Just got my vaccine and feeling relieved. Can't wait until we're all protected and can go back to hugging and high-fiving without fear
1	Getting vaccinated against the coronavirus is one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself, your loved ones and your community. With vaccines widely available, there is no reason to delay
0	I broke up with my ex in November of 2019 when I found out she was cheating on me. In hindsight, it was probably perfect timing because she may have convinced me to get the vax. And I'm sure she got it because she works in healthcare and most of them are brainwashed and are now the foot soldiers that are supposed to be the credible brainwashers spreading the message to their inner circles.
1	As usual the antivax cult is getting everything wrong again.
0	It is called murder, Pfizer has murdered and hurt millions yet they are still giving covid shots at Walgreens, CVS, Costco and medical facilities. Pfizer is also planning more emergencies to sell more vaccines.
0	My mom is taking the vaccine tomorrow and am worried
1	Make sure you get vaccinated! It is the responsible thing to do, the only way to eradicate COVID19 and it‚Äôs devastating effects is to get vaccinated! Not only are you protecting yourself but your loved ones!
0	WE WERE RIGHT TO REFUSE THESE TOXIC INJECTIONS ALL ALONG!!! GOD HAVE MERCY ON THOSE WHO WERE FOOLED, BUT I CALL FOR SWIFT JUSTICE AND PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE WHO DELIBERATELY AND KNOWINGLY DECIEVED THE PEOPLE FOR PERSONAL GAIN. GOD SEES ALL. NO ONE EVER GETS AWAY WITH ANYTHING. PICK YOUR SIDE WISELY
1	I've had all of mine. The last one didn't even give me a sore arm as the others had. I am glad to have been fully vaccinated but I still take precautions. I still wear a mask in public and I still social distance... Covid is still out there and it is still killing people. Not as many as at one point but still enough we should all be careful. If you want to laugh, go ahead. If you want to get it. Have fun. I prefer to stay Covid free if at all possible. So far, so good.
0	Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat was a side effect I had after getting the vaccine.
0	Thanks to Covid we now know vaccines are useless against viruses and do more harm than good. We now know all the 'science' is paid for by Big Pharma and we now know 'who' the bad guys are.
0	I have a confession to make..... I, Janelle Livingston, have gotten the vaccine.. I never wanted it to be this way, all this brainwashing in the media has led my four year old son threatening me to get the vaccine.... I am sorry
1	I am confident in the effectiveness of the vaccine.
1	do you not want to live a long healthy life?
0	All covid vaccination programmes should stop immediately... they cause an unprecedented level of harm and death to young people and children
0	That is a true critical thinker. Not swayed by bullying of the elite or the propaganda machinery.
1	Please spread the word on vaccines! Right now, let‚Äôs not be picky with brands. THE BEST VACCINE IS THE ONE AVAILABLE. Any vaccine, regardless of brand, will protect you from DEATH and severe cases 100%. What we need now is HERD IMMUNITY!
0	I got the jab‚Ä¶worst decision of my life. Ever since I got it I have had health problems such as a chronic cough, chest pains and regurgitation. Anyone else feel similar?
0	My daughter needed some tests done at the hospital but before they would test her she was informed she had to be fully vaccinated. She told me she had a bad feeling about it but the tests were necessary so she felt as though she did not have a choice. The first vaccine made her sick for 3 weeks and she never recovered from the second vaccine she died from pneumonia but a rare type. This is her photo
0	I was essentially forced to be triple jabbed to keep my job or be fired. Bitterly regret not standing my ground
1	I'm unvaccinated and caught it last week. It's not great but not really any worse than the flu to be fair, I will get vaccines after recover.
0	You wanna live a long and healthy life? Ignore this
0	How about you start investigating the excess deaths around the world! Can't believe people are still buying into this BS. There are far too many red flags, always has been but now, more than ever! Lost all credibility.
0	Stopped taking any vaccines 17 years ago. Since then I've gotten sick once. About six months ago I got The Vid. Two days of aches and chills then fine. Now I'm immune from it. I think I'll.....continue to not take vaccines. I'm so healthy it makes doctors upset
1	Correct.Modern Medicine is the Life saver
1	If you are a overweight / obese person I strongly advise you to get the vaccine based on what ive seen on the frontlines in covid icu.
1	Turks saved the planet - such a headline for the marketing of the pfizer vaccine.
0	Congratulations John. I worked as a histology technologist, I was fired from my job because I chose not to get vaccinated. Today some neighbors help me with my food...I don't regret not getting the vaccine. Stay strong my brothers. Greece 2022!
0	Some of us just want the undiluted truth about things without name calling
1	Get vaccinated.
1	Yes, the government is injecting micro chips in you xD
0	Since I stopped getting vaccinated 6 yrs ago I'm the healthiest I've ever been. I used to get sick constantly. Now, I never get sick. Vaccines are poison to our immune system!
0	Praying for you and your family. Sorry you got that shot. I hope you are doing well.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it
0	Both of you explained the CV19 vaccine very well. Now could you please make a video about the advantages of contracting CV19 and what happens when you're body creates its own antibodies that's 10 times greater than the CV19 shot could ever produce? üëäüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üí™
0	Coming from someone who got both doses of vaccine, it SHOULD be a choice. I respect anybody who chooses not to get vaccinated because nobody knows what they're going through or what kind of condition or what beliefs they have that influence their decision. Just because the CDC thinks & says its the "right thing to do" doesn't mean it is for one particular person.
0	I regret getting the vaccine everyday and I know many others do too
1	I feel empowered knowing that I've done my part to protect myself and others by getting vaccinated against COVID-19.
0	I'll think about it. But I still have my doubts.
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
0	I'm so happy to see all these people resist this poison
0	I don't believe that the COVID-19 vaccine is necessary for ending the pandemic.
0	if any mis happened to anyone after vaccination are you take responsible or liability for any claims.  If Vaccine is safe then why not you are giving assurance and insurance.
0	you also have to look risk balance and the latest research show we now need to vaccinate 45k to prevent 1 hospitalization and 250k vaccines to prevent 1 serious illness, the latest figures have shown 10 people per thousands have serious issues,. This is clearly a risk reward that is just not worth it.
0	My Mom can't get out of bed without passing out. This has ruined our lives along with other friends of mine that now have heart problems at the age of 28 through 35. They were perfectly fine and healthy until they took it.
1	There is no better time to vaccinate to protect yourself, family, friends, and coworkers. That or you can continue to be selfish
0	I talked the other day to a DOCTOR and he told me he was not getting vaccinated. I was surprised. When I asked why? He told me he was a colleague of the doctor in Miami that died 3 days after getting the Psizer shot. NOT GETTING IT!
0	I‚Äôm old enough to remember when vaccinations prevented illness and death‚Ä¶
0	I've lived a good life. Enjoying every minute of it. I'm just fine with taking the risk of getting covid and dying. With a 99.x % survival rate I'll take my chances. I'll go out on my terms. Not the governments.
1	Covid-19 is far more dangerous and deadly. Take the shot
1	I wouldn't say its right to demonize them because they do have some protection, but getting the vaccine anyways would be a good move to further boost their chances at longer term immunity or against a different variant than they had that could possibly get them worse the next time around.
0	The affected brain is actually being affected by the vaccine. One person said, "I'm so pleased I'm not unvaccinated #pureblood because I recently caught Covid for the eighth time in two years and I've gotten five booster shots," which made me glad she wasn't. She is "grateful to be alive" after being "rescued" by the shot.
0	Vaccine for covid is dangerous
1	I have enough lower-middle-aged friends who didn't take the vaccine, got the disease and then regretted not taking it to want to continue to avoid the worst version of it.
1	One day, could be 50 years from now, you‚Äôre gonna die from cancer or heart disease or a stroke, and these fuckers will blame it on the vaccine, guaranteed.
0	My favourite new insult is "You sound vaccinated"
1	I care about people getting vaccinated because I‚Äôm tired of this pandemic with all this needless death. It‚Äôs a quick shot that you literally can get at any big box store or community center..
1	A better question is WHY would you not get a vaccine for the coronavirus? please base your answers on scientific research, not Facebook.
0	If something is good it doesn't have to be forced on people.
0	America is under attack by China, that's why we are forced to take the vaccine.
1	Vaccinated and it's working!!
0	No need for a shot. You have a 99.98 percent chance of beating Covid without a vaccine.
1	Make sure the anti maskers get it last
0	What's the difference between vaxxed & unvaxxed? We UNVAXXED aren't sitting around wondering if we're gonna die suddenly f/ #Myocarditis. ...cuz we actually trusted what evil scientists published even before COVID...that the vax would effectively kill alot of undesirable humans
1	Don't be afraid of the COVID-19 vaccine! The benefits of getting vaccinated far outweigh the risks. Let's protect ourselves and each other.
1	Roll up your sleeve, get vaccinated and join the COVID-19 protection squad.
1	After two years with masks and shutdowns and various restrictions people want their lives back. If you are vaccinated it‚Äôs clear your risk of serious illness is very low.
1	Pro-vaccination clusters successfully added many new links within the largest network patch and between network patches, despite the media ambience against pro-vaccination views during the measles outbreak in 2019.
1	Maybe the ban on masks will apply to doctors and nurses too - there's nothing like the surgeon breathing into your open body cavity to get to experience some new pathogens! Yeaa disease!
0	DON'T TAKE IT
1	People in the 1500s thought street lamps were gonna kill us all looks like we have never learned
1	so you don‚Äôt trust doctors and epidemiologists who study this stuff for a living?! Ô∏è If they get it I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fine. Remember, if you get COVID you can be asymptomatic but the virus can still do a lot of damage to your heart and other organs. So if you‚Äôre heart muscle is weakened you‚Äôre 10x more likely to have a complication from the yearly flu or even a cold. And it may be easier for you to get pneumonia as well.
0	Hopefully this picks up in the lamestream so we can welcome new people to what we knew 18 to 24 months ago
1	I've had two booster shots and am doing fine
0	The lie has always been tell everyone it‚Äôs safe under any circumstances all the time.
0	My husband and I along with most of the kids are also not going to. It's a personal choice, but I will tell the truth if asked. It's not for me either.
0	They're trying to cover up the poison known as the COVID-19 vaccine and its boosters
0	I feel dire.
0	When the manufacturer tells you they can't show you the trial data for 75 years you have to ask questions.
1	For me, the risk of the vaccine doesn't outweigh my decision to get one. I would rather risk anaphylaxis, in a controlled environment, than risk getting Covid. Just saying.
1	I cried happy tears getting my first shot today. Finally felt hopeful. It's been a long quarantine up in Oregon.
0	My relative just passed away yesterday from Covid shot!!! Be aware of
1	I'm not an antivaxer or anything. I'm really excited for this technology being used at this moment. But i think that is important for future reference, to disclose that it was also accelerated in the testing phase due to the emergency of the situation, being even quicker to develop.
0	Do you have ANY credible evidence to support your claims??? Since you're a SM nobody, I can't actually believe you on a prima facia basis, so post EVIDENCE or I have to call BS!!!
1	I fully recovered from the vaccines. I didn't fully recover from COVID.
1	I have to say that I've had 2 vaccines and 2 booster shots feel absaloutly spot on and had the flu jab too. Feel totally protected hopefuly you will be okay and not end up in hospital this winter
0	In a prescient article from December 4, 2020 ‚Äì before either Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna‚Äôs vaccine was authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use ‚Äì Dr. Derek Lowe warned us about coming ‚Äúfalse side effects‚Äù from COVID-19 vaccines.
0	How about simply admitting that the covid mRNA vaccines have been a failure and have injured & killed people? We cannot get to having an effective safe vaccine if organizations like the WHO refuse to be honest with the public?
0	The vaccine WILL cause damage to your brain!
0	A friend of mine worked as a farma salesperson. Being a doc herself she knew how to read the R&D papers. Asked about flaws in information. Got an answer for her employer and was said ‚Äòyou just need to sell the product, don‚Äôt ask questions‚Äô. She decided she didn‚Äôt want to be working for them anymore. Was the only one to quit out of a 100 people, who heard this response from their employer at a sales meeting. Even though she made Alot Of Money. Probably others wanted the money more than the truth or safety. She warned me pre-covid not to trust farma companies and especially not any new vaccines. Then Covid happend. Of course I am now called a conspiracy theorists and a non-scientific-at home facebook fake doctor for not taking the Covid vaccine.
0	End all this crap
0	My uncle had a heart attack 1 week after getting the Pfizer vaccine, lucky he survived, but is in constant pain. My aunt also started having uncontrollable shaking and tremors.
0	How can anyone trust a vaccine without any long-term trials?
0	I can't even communicate with vaccinated people. Their logic makes zero sense. Vaccinate, still gets Covid but tell me I'm dumb for not being vaccinated but I've never gotten Covid. Its unreal.
1	my attending nurse told me that after a 2nd dose.. you must wait 20 days before you do a swab test to avoid false positive detection of virus.
1	Why are we accusing our heros, the Big Pharmas for trying to make a profit when they literally created something to save our lives?
0	That is why I never took that rubbish üòÇüòÇüòÇ
0	They're not mentioning the biggest side effect...it doesn't work.
0	In the US most people do not know how to report and that includes the healthcare providers. Worse yet, a friend asked their doctor to report it and he told them he will be in deep trouble with state health authorities if he did. My friend tried to use the system to report it themselves and when calling for assistance from the reporting system itself, they were told the symptoms could not be vaccine related.
1	My friend's mom was on the fence about getting the vaccine. She went to her doctor and posed several questions. The doctor yelled, "You're not vaccinated yet!?" and spent several minutes chewing her out. She left super angry. The next week, same friend's mom saw another doctor and posed the same questions. The doctor took her seriously, answered all her questions, and encouraged her to get the vaccine. She and her entire family now have vaccine appointments lined up.   "It's not about winning. It's about helping."
0	No long term side effects... because its not been a long time yet
1	An effective nasal vaccine for Covid would be exceptionally valuable.
0	The problem is they don't care because they already won by having 90% of the population take the poison.
0	Who is this quack? Long term safety trials have been done in a few months not years? Paperwork reduction is the difference? Career aim: mass murderer? Who would have thought a robot could replace a journalist
0	69% percent vaccinated. 58% death. And the covid vaccin is not riskless. No thanks!
0	I am now anti vax too, and proud to say so.
0	Despite all these horrible experiences and testimonies, people are still lining up for boosters and more vaccines
0	Everyone I know who is sick, or can‚Äôt get rid of a cough, or had recent severe covid bouts, has been ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù.
1	Why am I getting so many anti-vax conspiracy theorists on my timeline, Blockity block
0	With every passing day, I'm happier that I rejected the vaccine. Especially after I caught covid and it was the mildest cold I ever had
1	How do I convince my mum to take the vaccine?
1	We need to take this more serious (yep, even more) and try to be safe, it‚Äôs the only way to stop covid, get your vaccin!!!!
1	The pandemic isn't over. COVID-19 is still dangerous as fuck. Wear the highest quality mask you can. Get vaccinated. Avoid large crowds (especially if they're maskless). Improve indoor air quality by improving ventilation and using HEPA filtration. Stay home if you're sick.
0	I don't believe a word the government or the agencies say about the pandemic,  the "vaccines" or the boosters. I would not trust our government or the WHO to so much as give me a bandaid or a baby aspirin. I will pray for peace with Russia and Ukraine.  And I will express my gratitude for good health by helping the vaccine injured.
0	Don‚Äôt tell me covid vaccines, don‚Äôt work. I got four shots and I am congested and have a minor case of covid right now.
1	My mom felt the same way until she was in a coma for two months fighting for her life. First thing she said we she came out of it was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting the shot‚Äù.
0	myocardial infarction ‚Äì269% increase Bell‚Äôs palsy ‚Äì 291% increase congenital malformations (for children of military personnel) ‚Äì 156% increase female infertility ‚Äì 471% increase pulmonary embolisms ‚Äì 467% increase
1	3 shots, sinopharm. People all around me tested positive, but i never did...
0	You can take my Pfizer shots seeing I'll NEVER take them and maybe your psoriasis will completely clear up.  I'm sure in a few years psoriasis will be the least of your worries, after injecting an experimental drug into your body!!
1	Completely agree. I have no sympathy at all for anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers. If it were up to me, I‚Äôd ban them from hospital treatment for COVID-19. Save the space for children and others who aren‚Äôt able to get the vaccine and who got infected by these dip shits
1	Get Vaccinated and stay alive !!!
0	stand up for the freedom and say no to the vaccine
1	The risk of getting COVID-19 is much higher for people who are unvaccinated than for those who are vaccinated. Globally, the vast majority of cases are occurring among unvaccinated people.
1	It‚Äôs so crazy that people are believing this shit. What a bunch of morons. Apparently before covid vaccines no one fuckin died. Anyone believing this page and all the bots following it. Seek help.
1	Wow this is so informative. I was hesitant to get my vaccine but I think I will do it now
1	I will get mine when it's my turn to get it. It takes everyone to keep this virus out. Even after my parents are vaccinated, they still have to wear their masks and keep their distance because the vaccine doesn't guarantee 100% immunity. We need herd immunity to stop this virus so we can all get back to our normal lives.
0	My mates cuz has just passed away he was triple jabbed and the clots they pulled from him were everywhere I believe.
0	Still trying to scare us of Covid? I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was the mRNA vaccine that was causing longterm problems.
1	Oh no! Thanks for letting us know. I had no idea BS was a side effect of the vaccine.
1	As a clinical analyst and graduate in Public Health, this man did an excellent job in detailing the efficacy and workings of these vaccines.
0	I had to take the clot shot or I couldn‚Äôt pay my jewish debt masters
1	So privileged to have received my COVID vaccine at Groote Schuur today. Thanks to all who‚Äôve made this possible.
0	We will soon be called criminals or worse if we don‚Äôt comply to the jab. Call on Jesus he is the only way out of this prison
0	What exactly did the Covid vaccines stop?
0	All of us who have had a vaccine, now have weaker immune systems. Today I had to sit down twice as my heart was pounding .... one very scary and it took a while for my heart to calm down.
1	Cuba produced its own Covid vaccines which most of the population took without a mandate. I‚Äôm sure you will soin that as some sort of trick and manipulation by the government. They saved lives in order to control or maybe they put a chip inside right?
1	I had my covid booster, pneumonia and flu jabs last autumn. I had a bad bout of flu (possibly covid) over Xmas.I am glad I had the vaccines as it might have been even worse.
0	The vaccinated population in the UK account for nearly 75% of alleged Covid-19 deaths, according to the UK Health Security Agency
1	PRO-Vaxxers, stand UP!
0	Non deadly solutions to covid have been available for a long time but pharma and our government blocked them from us so they could push the vaccine.
0	I know for some the vaccination has been fatal so I don't believe it's safe. Why should I be punished because I'm wary of an experiment?
0	My doctor told me I'm not at risk neither. I have diabetes too. He told me the chance if getting it us slim and even if I did get it I'm healthy enough to get over it and I'd become immune after that. The media told me to follow advice from medical professionals. I'm going to do that.
0	As a young person who has had covid, the vaccine is a No from me.
1	Vaccines are scientifically proven that they can prevent some of the specific diseases that are spreading. I can clearly call all the anti-vaxxers as being ignorant and illogical. Thereby ‚Äòstupid‚Äô, as you say!
0	You should trust Bill Gates with your health and with tech policy as much as you should trust him with your teen daughter.
0	With COVID-19, our pro-vaccine messages would be drops in a vast sea of misinformation, much of it poured in deliberately by anti-vaccine forces.
1	I can answer that since a local pharmacy had 2 doses left over at the end of today and I was able to snag one.
1	Going to the grocery store stresses me out.
0	The Covid vaccine is failing and doesn‚Äôt prevent people from getting Covid or transmitting it. Rather than admit failure, they‚Äôre doubling down on lies and forcing folks to get it. This is criminal bullshit.
1	I was afraid of vaccine but not wearing any mask whatsoever in my office environment.  I'm not really into covid conspiracy theory or anything, but yeah I was so ignorant and not really thinking about the risk.  Now I'm infected.  Thank God the symptoms are not serious but still, I don't want to get infected again in the future.
1	Vaccines don't cause autism. FACT. Just stfu about it. Kthx. What are you nostalgic about the good ole days of smallpox and polio? Get your damned shots.
1	Simple advice: get your #Covid vaccin when you can. It saves lives, including your own. Glad to have had mine, including registration in my vaccine passport (and a free sticker...).
0	#Study finds #unvaccinated people are #healthier than the #vaccinated  https://t.co/rM659nD0Sb https://t.co/PNBP4tOfaT
1	I'm feeling very positive. All educators across Grand Cayman had the opportunity to get their first Covid-19 vaccin
1	Just got my third shot! Boost me up!!!!
1	HIV/AIDS, Diabetes, High blood pressure, Cancer, Mental Health issues, or Chronic kidney disease all are Diseases that can weaken your immune system‚Ä¶.. get vaccinated for Covid 19 to protect your loved one and yourself today¬† I am Vaccinated
0	You should make a video discussing why children and athletes are collapsing from heart attacks after taking these, cheers.
1	Great ad! I hope it encourages people on the fence to get vaccinated.
0	Vaccine manufacturer Moderna...  Applied for a Sars-Coronavirus vaccine patent nearly one year prior to the outbreak..  Their reason: "In the event of a re-emergence or DELIBERATE release of a Sars-Coronavirus"  Vaccine development was ALREADY UNDERWAY when this request was made.
0	Lack of long-term studies of mRNA technology in human patients (with no way to sue the companies if something goes wrong) seems like a pretty valid reason to not get vaccinated.
1	Have some responsibility and take the damn shot
0	All of that reasoning is very nice.  This is easier.  They were performing an experiment with a novel treatment method.  Risk of the virus was very, very low.  Risk of the treatment is unknown.  I'll take my chances.  I'm in the Control Group.
0	Pffft, who needs a vaccine when you've got those flintstone vitamin gummies from 10 years ago.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	Yeah, it‚Äôs kind of a waste for me to get a vaccine, but whatever. It‚Äôs free and I had no side-effects because I already had antibodies.
1	Got my first dose of moderna yesterday. The side effects are there but doesn't feel nearly as bad as the flu or common cold. More like a mild hangover. I believe it is worth it to get the vaccine.
1	Vaccines don‚Äôt prevent infection. That has never been the purpose. They prevent more deaths and severe illness. Congratulations yours worked as advertised.
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
0	dont give a Fuk to vaccines and just live... do you know the survival rate of covid? Like 99.9 to 99.7 at worst
0	propaganda
0	The late Dr Luke Monteneau, predicted this very thing almost two years ago.  I believe he called it antibody dependent enhancement and essentially said these jabs will obliterate people's natural immune system.  Congrats, those of you who took it, you're all lab rats In a clinical trial.  Don't believe me, think I'm a conspiracy theorist.  Ask your pharmacy to show you the package insert on the vial, and then ask if you can instead have Commardity.
0	Let's see some more videos where some rich country singer who knows five chords tells us how safe the jab is. LOL
1	Yes, once it‚Äôs available to me as I‚Äôll be last on the list due to being young and healthy.
0	The very fact this  Covid-19 vaccine has taken 10 months to make rather than 10-15 years fills me with alarm not joy! There is good reason it takes so long to produce SAFE vaccines, to study the long term effects! This can‚Äôt possibly be known in 10 months.. No vaccine for me! https://t.co/FEpNk9UVkb
0	People are finally starting to wake up, and finally see what evil rules above us, and it‚Äôs horrific!
1	God Bless you Dr. Fauci.  I have had all the covid shots and boosters and I have asthma and without this vaccine and if I got covid, it would have been devastating.  I am grateful that we can vaccinate against this and other illnesses.
0	I don't trust pharmaceutical companies, and I don't think they have our best interests in mind when it comes to the COVID-19 vaccine.
0	I don't trust the vaccine, it was developed too quickly and hasn't been thoroughly tested.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a crucial step in the right direction. Let's all do our part to bring an end to this pandemic and get back to normal life.
1	How can this be surprising when there‚Äôs a large chunk of the general public who refuses vaccines we already have (MMR, Varicella, Tdap, etc)?
0	Having read a lot of the comments on this post, I‚Äôm wondering if those who‚Äôve offered zero sympathy, & question if she can ‚Äòprove the jab caused it‚Äô are V‚Äôd or unV‚Äôd. Generally speaking, those of us who warned against these vaccines did so out of concern
0	The flu vaccine has been around for ages and doesn't stop the flu from killing, miraculously, the same number of people the "Coronavirus" kills.  I WILL NOT take either. https://t.co/klDKLRzxsp
0	It's the mRNA tech that scares me! I have done a lot of research and I'm not talking it! I am 74!
1	I got my shots months ago, feel great!
1	Just had my first Astrazenica shot last week. Had it around 6:30pm. No symptoms that night but had crazy, violent dreams. Next day I was good until roughly 4pm and felt like I was getting the flu. Chills, dead tired, achey. Horrible! Went to bed early and felt ok next day.
1	Great video. You saying that by using m RNA pfizer was able to speed up development. So it means if we develop inactivated virus vaccines like Sinovac it should take much longer.
0	My grandmother has been tremendously healthy all her life. She received the Pfizer vaccine shots when they first came out and with 2 months she developed a football sized cyst on her ovaries that now her physician fears is a cancerous tumor. She's going to a specialist soon but she asked a nurse if her condition was from the vaccine. The nurse told her if she spoke openly about it, she would lose her job.
0	People they interviewed: "I don't really feel like I need it. It's my choice and I just decided not to get it." Interviewer: "See? they have this prevailing distrust of the government"
1	I feel great. It‚Äôs nice to be more active than being stuck at home. I like seeing my friends in person rather than over text.
0	How do we know what is inside the vaccine?
1	Got my cpvid vaccine and I feel confident in returning to work now
0	I mean the vaccines don‚Äôt work. Everyone who has gotten it keeps getting sick
1	There are billions of people vaccinated worldwide, seems like it's not a problem in reality - dying from the vaccine
1	I will take it.The scientists will be taking the vaccine, in fact most are involved in the trials, and so will their friends and relatives.
0	never took it and did just fine.
0	did you see the lady in tv collapsing right away after getting the shot? Its hard to conceal the truth on live tv
0	Think about it...Have the m/RNA Covid Vaccines passed the full FDA Human Trials, analysis and published Peer Reviews as required before March 2020? NO Have the m/RNA Covid Vaccine modifications/updates been subjected to any FDA Human Trials? NO Have the m/RNA Covid Vaccine Boosters been subjected to any FDA Human Trials? NO Have there been any m/RNA human trials for growth and reproduction system effects on m/RNA Vaccines or Booster given to adolescent children? NO Have there been any foreign government studies publish that state the unvaccinated died at the same or lower rate than vaccinated? YES The UK all-cause mortality data¬†show¬†‚Äúno evidence at all‚Äù¬†that the unvaccinated were dying at a higher rate than the vaccinated in 2020 and 2021. Have there been any foreign government studies published showing adverse effects from the m/RNA Covid Vaccines in younger males 14 to 30 years of age? YES NIH: National Library of Medicine, National Center for Biotechnology Information: Myocarditis after BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine against Covid-19 in Israel Do the m/RNA Covid Vaccine companies and providers have any Liability in the event of death or adverse effects in those Vaccinated? NO, they have full immunity to Lawsuits for current or future deaths and adverse effects including birth defects.
0	Now the question is can you sue the government or Fauci for making you take the vaccinations
1	I'm protected against COVID-19 thanks to my vaccine.
0	Today = Rare side effects, 6 months later = side effects, 1 year later = common side effects include
1	Vaccines make my vulnerable family safer
1	Getting vaccinated is a small sacrifice that can make a big difference in the fight against COVID-19
0	I have better natural immunity from Covid infection and not at risk from the thousands of side effects from the vaccine.
1	My sleeve will always be rolled up as long as this sinister nefarious virus is running amuck in our midst.
1	Vaccinated this Morning in Moscow with sputnikV vaccination against Covid19.
0	The covid vaccine is DANGEROUS! DO NOT take the shot! My very healthy 35 year old nephew DIED from myocarditis one year after receiving the vaccine.
1	People refusing to wear jackets have a higher death rate from the cold. Experts are baffled
1	48. "I don't think the vaccine is necessary because I believe in natural immunity."
1	i just got my first dose on tuesday (i never found the time until now) and i‚Äôm excited for when i‚Äôm finally done!
0	May all the young children who suddenly died from receiving the 'COVID POISON' jab, RIP
0	The mRNA in the vaccine will give you Alhzhinmers
1	Polio, measles, mumps‚Ä¶ we need better education on the importance of vaccines before we slip backwards even farther
0	Covid was Engineered so they could have an excuse to get that vaccine in to you and your children.
1	The point is...that FOUR of my neighbors died of Covid in 2021, not vaccinated.   The fact is that my mom at 98 years old, full vaccinated got Covid in 2022 and had no symptoms at all.
0	Not this bullsh#t again...even those who have had it as said it doesn't work
1	I'm getting the Pfizer vaccine tomorrow! My Mother got the Moderna one two weeks ago. The rollout in my State has been problematic, especially the online booking systems.
1	Maybe people of color just don't want to take it right now. It's not that we'll so afraid & we're not stupid. The problem is tha you all. Saying things like people not aware of vaccine. Stop trying to pick people to influence people of color to hurry & get this vaccine. Who are you? I'm a believer & when God speak for me to take I will. And I seek him in everything.
1	I am a firm believer in modern medical science! I got my jabs!
1	Gotta love how much is shown out of context Other than showcasing vague statements instead statistics, facts and proof as to exactly why ppl refuse vaccination...
0	Get over this obsession with vaccines!!!
1	I'm 84 and on my own.  I've had all the other boosters, and I think have had the Omicron virus, but home testing did not detect it. Still, since I've had no long term negative effects from the shots, I am thinking that it's a good idea to take the upgrade
0	Until you can prove that these vaccinations don't cause sterilization, I will not encourage anyone to take the vaccinations.
0	Skeptical about Covid Vaccine, Unsure About Other Vaccines
1	Vaxxing is the key to unlocking our freedom and returning to normal life. I know that we still have a long way to go, but with the help of these vaxes and everyone doing their part, I have faith that we'll get there eventually. Rollin' up my sleeve, who's with me?
0	The so called vaccine doesn't contain a dead covid virus‚Ä¶it does, however, contain drugs used to execute inmates via lethal injection, as well as drugs known by the CDC to cause melanoma and other cancers.. and the government expects everyone to take this shit with a smile?
1	Hype ! Gonna take my Vaccine immediately . So cool . !
1	Finally booked for my booster! Woot woot!
1	We are headed in that direction. Israel data showed them something a bit different when it came to the Delta variant and are already issueing a third shot.  And we aren‚Äôt even 12 month in with the vaccine.  Now the anti-vaxxers are using the wide spread contagion they created as proof that the vaccine doesn‚Äôt work.
0	My brother died 12 hrs after 1st dose of the Pfizer of a massive heart attack.. Come to find out one of the Severe side effects of the vaccine
0	These guys won‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôm a scientist and I‚Äôve lost all faith in our medical system. Absolutely and completely. Their oath says not to lie and that‚Äôs all they do
1	Thank to vaccine we can stay at least a little safe
0	Unvaccinated, got covid in March. 24 hrs of a sore head and feeling generally unwell. Back to normal the next day. Had way worse hangovers. Glad I stuck to my guns as I obviously didn't their vaccine.
0	No, and for the reason I don‚Äôt think this COVID stuff is as serious as everyone is saying, I can point out the flu had way more cases then COVID ever did, and their was no lockdown then, so why now, the flu is way more serious and we still have no cure for that and everyone is still going about their everyday lives not complaining about that, unless someone can prove to me otherwise I stand by what I say
0	We have seen people have adverse reactions to these vaccines and many vaccinated have still gotten sick and all we keep hearing is we need boosters!
0	My sister in law‚Äôs father passed away this morning from covid after getting both doses of vaccine three months ago.
0	People were forced to take it and people were also told that there is no natural immunity. But you‚Äôre saying here it‚Äôs to prepare your body to be immune to it  ¬ø?
0	I am 68 years old,  not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy
0	My list of people I know who have been injured or have died from the #CovidVaccines is up to 32. #StoptheShots
1	Just this morning, I responded to something even more irrelevant from a prominent Twitter COVID vaccine skeptic. I educated him about heat transfer in space. He blocked me immediately. I don't know what's going on. I guess the Mavericks just aren't good at working together?
0	Ok but Doctor could you please elaborate than why people are dying even after getting vaccinated with two dose yes not single but two doses? Is the dosage quantity given appropriately?
1	vaccination is key to reaching immunity
0	OMG MY FATHER ALMOST DIED BECAUSE OF THIS VACCINE SHIT
1	An anti vaxer is a person who constantly spreads bs about vaccines
1	I¬† got the vaccines, felt sick and then better
1	Any substantial side effects are really rare, much less of a risk than covid. Get the vaccine as soon as you can
0	They changed the definition of what a "vaccine" is. This is a mRNA vaccine (the normal vaccines have incredible success rates). This is a clear case of fraud and to some extent a murderous event with intent. Therefore we must conduct an investigation by the good guys
1	29."I'm not sure if I want to get the COVID vaccine because I don't trust the pharmaceutical companies behind it."
0	Just imagine how foolish the vaccinated must be feeling at this stage in the game
0	THE ONLY ‚Äú THREAT‚Äù TO THE WORLD IS YOU AND BIG PHARMA YOU WORK FOR KEEP THE PEOPLE IN A CONSTANT STATE IF FEAR NARRATIVE
1	I experienced the said side effects of Pfizer vaccine as mentioned in the video. But it lasted for only 1 day after the 1st and 2nd jab of Pfizer vaccine. On the 2nd day, everything feels normal. No more pain in the injected area, headaches, fatigue and dizziness. Thank you to the experts who worked hard to develop vaccines against COVID-19,
0	Nah you‚Äôre not gonna give me some ‚Äúnew‚Äù vaccine for one 5$ joint
1	Here‚Äôs the most important point and yet the one Joe missed: 200,00unvaccinated needlessly died, mostly in Texas + the South because they refused a Covid vaccine during the delta wave of 2021 early 2022 when vaccines were >90% effective. They were victims of antivaccine activism
1	I am lucky to have three but we still wear mask and distancing
1	"Vaccines cause blood clots" And yet, antivaxers aren't concerned with COVID-19 induced blood clotting. The rate of clotting from COVID-19 is substantially higher than that of vaccination. Explain antivaxers.... https://ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.121.035613
0	Why do we need a vaccine today? We don‚Äôt, we need strong ‚ÄúImmunity‚Äù from eating quality Nutrition from plant-based diets/lifestyles. Strong immunity is able to fight off all Viruses and Disease.
0	Follow the science right up the ASS of big pharma where it came from!
0	I trust this stuff about as much as I trust the people pedalling it.
1	Many studies have always shown the truth for those who really want it!  The vaccine saves lives & protects against hospitalization & death.  If you truly want the truth ask your doctor.  Truth isn‚Äôt found on political ‚Äúnews‚Äù shows or YouTube.
0	I like how they never mentioned one of the reasons being these people see first hand the serious negative side effects of these vaccines.
1	Yes the vaccine will keep you from dying
0	Let's say hypothetically that the vaccines actually only saved 50,000 lives (and not around three million like Fauci days) That would be a sixty-times exaggeration.... Would it be acceptable for a public health official to exaggerate by sixty times ?
1	Take control of your health, get vaccinated and become a part of the solution to the pandemic.
1	I will definitely be getting the shot because that is the only way that we will be able to get rid of this terrible disease.
1	Antivaxxers don't give a fuck about answers, facts, logic, or reason. They're functioning off pure selfish emotions, and nothing more.
1	Any success news of a vaccine is a good news https://t.co/cTeuVEXoMX
1	Conspiracy theories are as old as mankind. What‚Äôs new however is that social media platforms have created information bubbles or echo chambers and people can very easily get trapped into these.
1	Fuck i hope so. That fucking tweet was stupid as heck. They should take his license away after that.
1	all the vaccines  make me feel better after injection
0	Never and never
0	Never had one, never will, I‚Äôm doing just fine. How much money is Pfizer paying you guys.
1	I am interested in learning more about how the intranasal covid vaccine/booster is manufactured. This could be a very good thing!
0	If there‚Äôs time to make videos like this, we are not in the world‚Äôs deadliest pandemic.
0	Just wait. You laugh now but I bet in like 30-40 years you'll feel the consequences - back pains, worse sight, hair loss, numerous health problems in general.
1	I don't want to get covid so I will be taking the vaccine
0	The vaccine doesn't work. Fully vaccinated and still got COVID.
1	You should not so much ‚Äòbeleive‚Äô it as you should educate yourself and come to understand and accept it as true. Do your own homework, but it is a fact and there is overwhelming evidence to that effect. It is either willful ignorance, sheer stupidity, or utter madness to think otherwise.
0	Face it. The vaccine doesn't fucking work!!
1	Together, we can ensure access to safe and effective vaccines for all citizens, including the most vulnerable. This is the lasting solution
0	I'm not an anti-vaxxer but a vaccine developed in 6-12months is giving me doubts.
0	If you force someone into something that‚Äôs good for them then they‚Äôll obviously question why you‚Äôre forcing them into it if it‚Äôs so beneficial anyways .
1	I love to hear doctors talking rationally, not scaring if you've been vaccinated and trying to help in any way they can. It's difficult to find a doctor like this
0	A friend of my parents, who works at our local university (Ontario, Canada) was told she either had to get vaxxed or she'd lose her job. She couldn't afford to lose her job, so under official protest, she got the vaccines, though very upset about it. She found out a few months ago that she now has Myocarditis
1	I got my first dose on Monday. Was so happy to get started.
0	For the millionth time, it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù!! It‚Äôs nothing more than a shot that contains mRNA (poison). It does nothing to stop one from getting it or transmitting it‚Ä¶ same as the flu shot! How is anyone going mandate something that does not work! It‚Äôs poison!
1	There's a vaccine against being an anti-vaxxer. It's called education.
0	How many medical doctors have been silenced for speaking up against it
0	When my grandad got pnuemonia they put him on the ward with all the covid patients. They then rang my grandmother, who has dementia, and asked for her to approve a DNR for him. She said yes, not knowing what they meant. Luckily my dad and I were there to snatch the phone and tell them how utterly inept they are.
0	‚ÄúVaccinated‚Äù: You got Covid, likely more the once, possibly twice or more. Why? ‚ÄúUnvaccinated‚Äù: Never had Covid.
0	I tried to warn everyone and was silenced, shunned, censored, banned and had friendships ended. I did my part.
0	My gf just got covid, got really sick, and her first thought was that I should be vaxxed (we live together). I did get sick, had a sore throat, and moved on.  I dont think the vax argument holds üòÇ good for you standing your ground.
0	My nephew had always ran 4 miles per day, heartbeat around 45 bpm after vax it will go from 45 to 120 no warning. He passes out 2-3 times a day, his grandparents on both side are 83+ years old. No alcohol/drugs and only eats whole clean foods. Top Cardiologist says it‚Äôs from vax
0	No shot here. I got covid and was sick for 2 days. I have a kick-ass immune system.
1	Vaccines today are a vital tool in the fight to defeat various illnesses. Don't be mistaken in the thought that a vaccine is only for Covid19, there are many other vaccines being used for viral infections which results in a great deal illnesses being stopped.
0	Two things were on commercials as being free in 2020. The 5g phones and the vaccines. In a society being owned and ruled by money, why are so many sheeple thinking that something labeled as Free is something that will help them? Natural selection and darwinism working in full throttle these days.
1	The vaccine skeptics are idiots. Wait till polio and measles come back in force.
1	Science shows vaccines to be safe, the only people peddling lies about vaccines are those trying to sell snake oil products in their place
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
0	I cannot believe they would pressure this young woman like this. It‚Äôs ABUSE!!!!
1	Getting the #CovidVaccine is a small step with a big impact, let's do our part in ending this pandemic
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	MIT Professor calls for worldwide halt to the mRNA COVID shots. I could not agree more! The evidence is crystal clear. And now ANYONE can do the same survey I did and prove it. You don't have to trust THEIR data anymore.
0	the vaccine had killed everyone who got it, right bruh?
0	I know people who already have heart problems, irregular, fast palpitation, hardness of breathing after vax and boosters.
1	I had the vaccine 2 weeks ago with zero side effects. Zero
0	The vaccine is safe and effective, says the company who is mutating the virus to sell more vaccines‚Ä¶
1	Kills me when people say it hasn't been researched enough as they take another drag on a cigarette
0	I talked the other day to a DOCTOR and he told me he was not getting vaccinated. I was surprised. When I asked why? He told me he was a colleague of the doctor in Miami that died 3 days after getting the Psizer shot.
0	I still can't help remembering when random people were blaming me for killing their grandma, calling me other assorted disparaging names and a few even wished death...because I dared make public statements to please pay attention to risks vs benefits, and do their own research. And to PULEASEEEE not get their children jabbed.
1	People do not realise how privileged they are to be able to get vaccinated. Here in Africa we still wait. Well done.
1	Getting vaccinated is a step in the right direction towards returning to normal and ending the pandemic.
1	The best explanations I have heard so far. I am fully vaxed and thankful for it. Thank you for doing this debunking video.
1	It's so ironic to see people smoking while talking about putting a harmful vaccine in your body
0	As someone who had very serious side effects from the jab, if I could go back, I would not take it again.
0	The jab is a microchip
0	Remember #Thalidomide was deemed safe & effective
0	Steve Kirsch's newsletter: Death reports PROVE that the COVID vaccines are killing people of all ages and should be immediately stopped
0	God bless, I feel sorry for people who died in the blossom of their lives because of adverse reaction. And no one took it seriously. That is terrible...
1	Getting vaccinated is the responsible thing to do for ourselves, our families, and our communities
0	I'm a non vaccinated person living in South Africa, we won't stand for it, thank you for talking about the "create a need" process that these companies should be held accountable for. Give back the money
0	What gets me is why are they worried about the unvaccinated? If your vaccinated didn‚Äôt they say you should be protected? Then why worry ? Doesn‚Äôt make sense unless the vaccines don‚Äôt work effective against COVID and don‚Äôt last. That makes more sense
0	We cannot ignore the fact that Vaccines is killing our people and we have ourselves to blame. #KillerVaccines #VaccinePassport #vaccinedeaths
1	A safer summer starts with a #CovidVaccine. Ty recently got his second dose and he is ready to play basketball again. With fewer restrictions in Contra Costa, you might be wondering what that means.
1	Remember: to take your shot of Covid 19 vaccin is an act of solidarity.
0	My gut said it was going to kill me so I waited it out. Then the comments of clots and menstrual changes rolled in. Then that men were having heart problems. I always feared I mad a bad choice because my bf wanted to get it at first for his grandpa. I pleaded with him and he agreed not to get it until we heard more. Turns out he's in the highest risk category for men and heart problems being a very tall very strong guy with huge lungs. We both remain unvaxxed and we are fine.
1	Let's do our share in ending this pandemic by getting vaccinated and encouraging others to do the same.
1	Good Morning to everyone who knows pizza and hamburgers are deadlier than the Covid Vaccine.
1	Since the vaccine does not stop the spread, how can taking it in be unselfish? You still spread the virus to other people.
1	Vaccination can stop this pandemic)
1	Vaccines are the best way to protect ourselves and our communities from COVID-19.
1	The argument for an unlimited degree of parental liberty for making medical decisions really does not consider parental neglect as a possibility.
1	Make sure you are up to date on your booster shots!
0	I trust my immune system
0	I agree, the J&J vaccine seems to be left out of the conversation a lot. I hope more research is done on the long-term effects, as I'm curious about the safety too
1	Thank you thank you thank you. Clean water and vaccines have improved our lives more than any other intervention. We owe the current lives we live to those factors. The fact that we can even have anti vaccine sentiments is because these plagues have been squashed and are distant memories. Let‚Äôs not relive the past
0	You can stick your untested product. Let‚Äôs see in a few years what happens.
0	39 years old and have never been sick a day in my life, last shot I had was before middle school.
0	How about NOT getting vaxxed and living normally. That way you don‚Äôt have a chance of seizures, blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks or Bell‚Äôs Palsy
1	Just got my Covid vaccine! Feels amazing to take a step towards normality again
1	Vaccines are not a cure, they help us to improve and immune system. I believe in science!
1	If you have a heart attack or any kind of problem, you can‚Äôt even get into the E.R. And I‚Äôm really of mind to say, ‚ÄòLook, if you didn‚Äôt get vaccinated and you got Covid, you don‚Äôt get into a hospital.
0	No. This so called vaccine must be forbidden with a law. It does much more damage than good.
1	I love how anti vaxxers was all about "Me", "my kids" and the pro vaxxers were all about "us", "them"
1	I got the vaccine to minimize my risk of getting severely ill. It's bad enough that you have to wear the mask whenever you leave the house.
0	BEST QUIZ EVER! 1. What vaccine doesn't stop you getting the disease it's supposed to protect you from ? 3. What vaccine doesn't stop you getting the disease then suddenly works perfectly when issued with a passport to enable people to gather together? 4. What pandemic silences the worlds most qualified immunologist if they see problems with the vaccines? Even the inventors of the said vaccine! 5. What vaccine contributed to an increase in deaths of that disease more so than the countries less vaccinated? 6. What vaccine, that's supposed to be safe, had immunity from prosecution and hides trial data for 95 years?
1	March/April 2021 were my first two doses, and in Mid-December 2021 I caught Covid. Shrugged it off like a mild cold, and just got my booster yesterday. Get the shots.
1	I hesitated getting vaccinated when it was available (45) to me. It was mostly just laziness, but I was also kind of paranoid about it to be honest. I ended up getting infected with a mild case of Covid (pneumonia, heart palpitations) and it put the fear of God in me lol. It took almost a month to get over it. I've got both Moderna shots since then. The only side effect I suffered from the vaccine was a swollen lymph node in front of my ear for about a week.
1	thank you for giving the importance of the vaccine
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	The virus is here to stay. We will have to prudently move towards a new normal, making the best use of the tools that can protect us, starting from vaccines.
1	I took the Pfizer Vaccine which is great üëç
1	I trust science
1	I‚Äôm from Arkansas, working in the ICU and this is very true about patients not wanting to believe that they have COVID and refuse the vaccine. It‚Äôs frustrating.
0	Why not list the serious side effects on here too...let people know there are chances they could die from the jab also
0	I know one person who died of heart attack at 38, and another one who got a blood clot in brain, both were healthy prior to vaccine.
0	No i won‚Äôt be getting it. I think there‚Äôs still a lot that‚Äôs unknown about the vaccines‚Ä¶ Long term side effects and how often they want us to take it are massive factirs for me. There is an extremely high survival rate and we‚Äôre all well aware of the high number of asymptomatic cases. Our bodies already have the T-Cells to fight it.
0	I know an awful lot of people in my area and I don‚Äôt know one person who has passed away except my friend who died after having the booster
1	Vaccination is the quickest way to get back to the activities we love
1	My mom took Covishield in the beginning of this month. She is 50 years old with no huge medical issues. She had a fever the day after taking the vaccine, and soreness on injection site for 2 days. She's all good now. All "side effects" are common post vaccine symptoms. Please get yourself vaccinated with any available vaccines at the earliest.
1	I get my second dose this week! :)
1	All people globally need to to be vaccinated and if necessary fourth jab be administered .
0	Well done to the CDC‚Ä¶.the anti vax movement could never have woken up so many people without your assistance in destroying public trust in vaccines and drug companies.
0	Dr. Fauci needs to be held accountable for the wrongs he did to the American people.
0	Is unvaccinated can go for a nice jog and not worry we might die. Can you say the same? Lol
1	Get vaxxed. Get boosted. Wear a mask and social distance indoors. Wash your hands.
0	First, they wanted to keep the clinical trial data hidden for 75 years. Now they're hiding the safety analysis data. We all know what they are hiding
0	I've known so many who have had terrible reactions and heart problem. Even several deaths I'm so glad me and mine didn't get it!!!
0	Some doctors advice is absolutely fatally bad advice. How many did they kill by promoting jabs?
0	I can‚Äôt even imagine being in a relationship with someone vaccinated. My family are bad enough üòÖ
1	It is sad that people get caught up in conspiracies that take their lives unnecessarily. Just take the vaccine.
0	53. "I believe getting vaccinated is the right thing to do for the good of humanity."
0	My younger sister is a doctor and asked me if I wanted to get vaccinated for covid BS and I freaked out and told her NO. Her reaction was priceless.
1	I am pro vaccine; I have anti vax family members who are genuinely afraid & have poor scientific education.
0	what science it's all built on lies fear mongering and threats by mandates etc
1	The #pandemic is not over yet. #DoItAll to #StopTheSpread of #COVID19. #MaskUpWell Wash/clean hands frequently Maintain a safe distance Stay in ventilated places Avoid crowded places Get vaccinated when it's your turn Cough/sneeze into your elbow
0	Are any still alive?
0	I KNOW MANY PEOPLE GOT THE VACCINE AND THEY GOT COVID AND DIE
0	I have been getting sick over and over after being exposed to one vacced person.
0	I‚Äôve known 3 people who have died of heart attacks and none of the families have even questioned if it could be the vax
0	My coworker just lost his wife a but over a week after they got a third shot. They were perfectly healthy and only mid-thirties. She'd said she felt short of breath. Her heart stopped while she was asleep. Most of my friends and coworkers are un-vaxxed, got covid, and only a few had it rough. All recovered.
1	An antivaxxer is like someone not calling the fire department when their house is burning down because they are worried about water damage.
0	The virus is a mutating one, as previously said; how will a vaccine be of any use anyhow? The virus will mutate, become stronger & still infect people.
1	I've had five shots now because it is the best thing to do to protect myself
0	Bunch of SCHMUCKS ! A rat wont even go back for a second shot of poison ! What a bunch of sheep , ever ask yourself WHAT IF ?
1	Show me a vaccine in history that has side effects show up years later. Side effects show up quickly with vaccine
1	Scientists say that 3.1 million lives have been saved in the US alone by covid vaccines
1	So, I got the COVID vaccine but through shedding, I ended up giving my wife Crohns 20 years ago. That‚Äôs how truly evil vaccines are. They are able to give you a disease IN THE PAST
0	I still don't get why ANYONE would want to put this clot shot into their body and especially in their kid's, voluntarily that is.
0	As a healthy individual you should understand that our bodies GOD GIVEN immune systems are the best way to combat something like this.
1	I'd heard that the COVID-19 vaccines were based on mRNA unlike traditional vaccines, but I didn't know how they worked or why this is such a great leap forward in vaccine technology until I saw this video. Thank you to the authors and to TED-Ed.
1	You allow unvaccinated students at school? And why can't my kid bring peanut butter?
1	I believe getting the COVID-19 vaccine is essential for protecting ourselves and our communities. It's been proven to be safe and effective, and getting vaccinated is the best way to stop the spread of the virus.
1	The coronavirus vaccine is your ticket back to normalcy ...
0	It takes years for side effects to appear, and they could very well be worse than the sickness.
0	There is a lot of money to be made in ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù: significant percentage of people going for natural immunity, i. e. getting sick are going to need some medical help, and almost any medical help is more expensive than the vaccine. Vaccine is the cheapest intervention against Covid per capita
1	Oh my immune system definitely noticed the first dose.  It hit me the same day heavy.  1 in 7 people get covid symptoms from the first dose so be prepared!  Happier to have that than real covid though :)
0	99.6% survival rate sounds like the opposite of deadly in my opinion. I will definitely not get the vaccine
0	No thanks to any vaccine
1	I am a Respiratory consultant. I and my family have been vaccinated. I work(ed) on the respiratory ward / RSU throughout. Vaccines reduce the need for RSU and ICU admission. They are safe and effective.
1	Laughed out loud. The toughest anti-vax and general anti-corona-measures opinion-bully in my life actually does sell jewelry.
0	I've Resisted against the medical tyranny and experimental jabs for the past years. I shall continue to fight the likes of Pfizer and their minions
0	People have died after getting the vaccine. 98%+ recovery without the vaccine IF you even get the virus. People that were vaccinated still got Covid. The vaccine is not FDA approved.
1	The analogies are key to get antivaxers to have a chance to understand how critical thinking works and why their belief is garbage.
0	For me, much good has resulted from the fake pandemic.  I now question the need for ANY vaccine; I now question everything I've been taught about history; I no longer trust "the science"; I've realised most domestic affairs are downstream from global affairs.
1	I got 1st 2nd and booster
1	Get well soon but the results of all the vaccination report to be produced at the end of 2022 so lets hope for the best. They also say no guarantees after the vaccination. Hmmmmm
0	Still unvaccinated, and couldn‚Äôt be happier.
0	I love how they always make the unvaccinated look like the bad guys
0	Everyday I thank God I never caved into getting the Covid vaccine #Unvaccinated
1	I've never understood anti-vaxxers, like regardless of the COVID vaccine, vaccines have been proven to be effective, and so have masks, IT'S WHY DOCTORS WORE THEM EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. WHY IS IT PEOPLE ALWAYS PUT THEMSELVES BEFORE OTHERS.
1	I got four COVID vaccines the last two-ish years. Most of my friends has got COVID vaccines, none are dead ;-)
1	Vaccines work. Thanks to vaccines multiple illnesses have been completely eradicated.
1	Kudos to #TBCPartner @CureVacRNA, which today published positive interim Phase 1 data for its #COVID19 vaccine candidate. Here‚Äôs coverage from @JohnCendpts: https://t.co/KOycUyDxX9
0	Its messed up that they are trying to force this vaccine and i feel bad for my brother for being suckered into it
1	My opinion is that this current Covid vaccine is good, though others *could* have side effects
1	COVID-19 primary vaccines and the original boosters have been effective at preventing people from getting severely sick
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
0	I don't want to be a part of a vaccine-injured statistic
1	Basis for vaccine almost 17 years in development due to SARS and H1N1. The DNA basics were there a year ago, then uniqueness of coronavirus applied. You are correct about uncertainty of side effects. I am diabetic, immune compromied blood cancer patience and risks v good 2/ https://t.co/1XVtEhLn3J
0	Why does the CDC #EarlyTreatmentWorks #StoptheShots #StopTheJabs  #InformedConsent https://t.co/KzJoUFlvIV
0	I don't care what the price is, I'm not taking it or any other COVID vax.
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel
1	Had a conversation with my 7 year old tonight about the vaccine. We're all ready to be able to get it in our house. I know it will be a bit, but we are ready to do our part.
0	Really strange CDC issued codes for doctors to label their patients ‚Äúdelinquent‚Äù if they refuse to get a COVID vaccine
1	"it's ok if you're scared, I'm scared too" Bitch, no one would be scared if y'all got vaccinated.
1	Here come the antivaxxers to spread misinformation and lies.
0	Still unvaccinated and healthy as ever thank you Jesus
0	People that are vaxed are getting Covid. Come on!!!
0	Greed and power. Big pharma has already shown us what they are willing to do for money again and again. I‚Äôm almost forty and because of the opioid epidemic alone I‚Äôve had to bury better men/ women than me.
1	My parents got covid (55+) and experienced brain fog that went away after vaccine. I would love to see something on pubmed detailing what anyone thinks is happening.
1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs the luck of the draw.
1	I don't want to rely on herd immunity to protect my child.
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
1	Congratulations on the protection and thank you for getting vaccinated.
1	95% save I like those odds
0	I have lost four people so far after being vaccinated,how do decieve us about safety?
1	Dying from a virus for which there is a safe and effective vaccine is a choice. A poor choice, but still a choice. Choose wisely. No sympathy.
1	In Britain, only 75 have been killed by Covid vaccines. That's the grand total! *Surprised? I was, too. Everyday, with the fake news on Twitter about people who had #DiedSuddenly, I thought there must have been more.
0	A co worker of mine dropped dead of a heart attack about 3 weeks after taking the jab. You won't hear that on places like BSNBC.
0	Beshear ain't giving me no DNA changing vaccine!
0	I have my ivermectin, no need for the shot
0	They knew about the side effects and are acting like there's nothing wrong knowing they warned NO ONE ABOUT THIS
1	Conservatives hate anything that is free and public. Maybe, now that it will cost money, they will finally get themselves vaccinated.
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it‚Äôs definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
0	Oh how the script flips, lol. Sorry to everyone who got conned into taking that secret chemical on their arm
1	People who barely use the internet got stuck inside and jumped on it without realizing trolls, scammers and idiots exist on it and just believed everything they saw.
1	The faster we vaccinate, the quicker we prevent the virus from mutating to a version that existing vaccines DON‚ÄôT treat. So stop virtue signaling with these dumb vaccination criteria and start mass vaccination programs. NOW!!
1	I've had 3 shots. Got covid 7 months after my last shot. Had zero symptoms. Had to because I was exposed to covid. 7 months later, got covid again. had a 101 fever for 1 night. Bad lower back paid. Woke up the next day feeling great.
0	Years ago, one of my pre-med professors told my entire class to never take a drug within it's first 5 yrs of development unless your life depends on it because researchers never really know the extent of what a drug can do until it's administered to a massive population of people. It takes years for that data to trickle in... I never forgot that.
1	Because I, as a respectable and responsible member of society, wish to prevent deaths that may be caused if I am negligent. The vaccine is new, yes, but it has been tested, and is still being tested, and nobody, other than a few individuals who suffered from an allergic reaction to the vaccine, has died from the vaccine.
0	What about simply not wanting to have a medical procedure forced upon you? Seems to me that most people I've met just don't want to take a shot, much like refusing to get a flu shot. They don't want govt or companies to dictate what goes inside them. Most of them actually believe the vaccine may or does help, but don't want the freedom of choice taken away.
0	Like the people who are dead from the vaccine?
1	These are claims by AntiVax to try to put people off being vaccinated. You have said that you are vaccinated against Covid-19 so you aren‚Äôt really the AntiVax target audience. Basically there‚Äôs no need to worry about that. Vaccine ingredients don‚Äôt stay in your body for long, and do not build up in your body, therefore there is no mechanism by which they could cause your death months or years after taking them. Here‚Äôs an answer from a reliable source to this sort of claim. https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fuk-factcheck-mrna-vaccines%2Ffact-check-there-is-no-scientific-evidence-that-mrna-vaccines-will-reduce-the-population-idUSKCN2AU2KR%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2hGupNWzyN52sOVSE_Y_ZHPNhYZ4lC_uWGno9ntEO5TPPZwnxdRTsupb4&h=AT1kLzhC_FCcib6Bdt18WGZfomkeogyktyR7jnL1fMPyKky3sjHyXOKoAt4BmhV1YvD_qcGUNLj5oevtZRpQ3wtI07Ht4d-zjaGxQ1PwCMGW8yAoZ4fjnVCIQymJ9v86F5YzKjJxhBUYol5ylw&__tn__=R]-R&c[0]=AT3B9CwotNIv63YbzAnoIFLUURCXAf4irBDFofujn_chrb9XkT7S1Gd12k-YvWwGRA5GvDu3vymmP1e0Tvovm0_9AHE1YuamQ4gNTyelZjaQt7BadT_OnNgHv1g_Sr0djTf5NCiWtq7crwiwyfNiLMVpAG-3zleg-teoX5D9aRVKhDxDNTe12yrJ8j2q41FqgR5I1DIimnTgoHPn8w
0	Every mistake that has ever happened, went over the heads of people who claimed it was safe!
1	Please get your vaccine as soon as you are able. It is the only way to end this pandemic for good.
0	Members of my family & close friends have all had the vaccination, it's horrible the way people seem to be taken over with all the brain washing to get a jab. I'm thankful there are others that don't want the jab either, I don't think there aren't enough of us left to make ourselves heard.
1	All over right-wing media, literally any health event anyone anywhere stuffers at any time is now evidence of the Covid vaccine being dangerous.
0	My circle of about 100 people. 6 of them had vey nasty side effects.
0	¬†Your wife took the jab..sadness..My husband is the only one who took it and hopefully he doesn't have any future health issues due to the covid jab..

0	The problem is that the government can and has restricted where you can go and what you can do if you are not been vaccinated.
1	you might care about people like me who got vaccinated but didn't make antibodies (immune-suppressed)
1	I have never had COVID and worked through the whole pandemic. #vaccine saves lives.
1	I know two people in the hospital right now fighting for their lives because the child/ teenagers unknowingly got covid and brought it home to the parents. The kid is at home with mild symptoms,  but both parents are in the hospital.  How do you think that kid feels ? Both parents are very sick and don't know if make it. Following the covid protocols isn't just for you.  It decreases infection rates for those around us.
1	i miss the good times of before 2020 when being antivax was shunned upon
1	I'll take my chances with the vaccine.
1	The pro-life movement is patting itself on the back today when they refused to wear masks or get vaccinated during an actual crisis, resulting in the premature deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans.
1	Imagine seeing a obituary for a child. And your first thought is "Let me hunt down the child's family, claim the vaccine killed the child and then blame the parents for the child's death without knowing anything!" and then these details to your thousands of followers...
0	How long after vaccination are being having complications? Is it soon after or can it happen months or over a year later?
0	Do NOT get this vaccine
0	Oh, please, stop lying! More than 90% of the ones in ICU for Covid, here in Scandinavia, are fully vaccinated. Denmark has now BANNED giving the vaccine to anyone under 18, because of all the side effects... Yeah, some "vaccine", eh
0	I'm concerned about the potential side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine and don't want to take any chances.
1	I trust the science behind vaccines and the way they keep us healthy.
0	Not taking a vaccine for a cold. I don't care what they call it.
0	I am 71 years old. I have never had a vaccination in my entire life. My parents believed in the body's ability to develop its own natural immunity and encouraged me to take responsibility for my own health. That is all I am doing; choosing to do what I know is right for me.
1	Official Headline: stupidity goes viral online. Spreads to real life....
0	So it's an arbitrary number depending on far too many variables that have little to no direct correlation between receiving the vaccine or not. This number could quite easily be manipulated
1	I had to get the chicken pox vaccine twice because I got my first one too early as a kid :( I was so mad at the time. I was 8 lol. Super excited when I got to get my COVID vaccine!
1	I‚Äôve had 4 now, still alive, no side effects. So did everyone in my family Had covid once and it wasn‚Äôt bad, only felt under weather for 3 days. No regrets. I don‚Äôt take medical advice from flat earthers
0	It had been a long time since I felt so bad. #FuckAstrazeneca
1	I had one dose of Pfizer so far. Good to see actual explanation of what the vaccine does
0	Glad they‚Äôre ending discrimination based on medical status
1	The science behind the #CovidVaccine is solid, and the benefits far outweigh any temporary discomfort
1	Everyone should get it
1	One of the reasons people stay healthy is because they have vaccinations.
0	I regret getting vaccinated. I did it for my parents, but it has not done well for me. And I can't take back time
0	You are pushing propaganda (sounding like a complete bitch while doing so) I met about 13 friends for the watch games etc in Reno,NV last weekend. Crowded casinos & strip clubs. 5 tested positive once they got home all of them were vaccinated and boosted. All 6 of the unvaccinated had no issues. I will continue natural immunity forever.
0	Still unvaccinated and healthy as ever thank you Jesus
0	Carlson is telling the truth. The states follow CDC guidelines. This is the way the government and the vaccine companies push unnecessary vaccinations onto the young population that has practically no risk of death from Covid.
0	You protect nobody, neither yourself nor anyone else.
0	I've had it. No jab for me ever.
1	Astounding to see Trump do the right thing for once. But so many OTHER Republication politicians are urging people not to get vaccinated or wear masks.
0	My Mother always taught us as children to NOT trust the government.
1	If you think Ivermectin is better at fighting COVID-19 than the vaccines, the human species will be stronger without you.
0	I am afraid of the already imbalanced people that are obsessed with the jab and when they find out they've been duped and in 10 years it's not a sexy topic and their body is failing they will become very... Very..angry
1	I heard of one doctor who refuses to treat unvaccinated patients. All doctors should do the same. There is no reason to take on more risk to themselves for patients who refuse to take even basic precasutions.
1	Vaccines have saved millions of lives and have been used for decades to protect us from diseases. The COVID-19 vaccine is no exception. Let's put an end to this pandemic together.
0	And it'll work about as good as the covid vaccine (not at all)
1	my mom always says that there are anti-vaxxers today because they didn't see how polio ravaged children - they didn't see the horrors of a truly devastating disease. Parents lined up their children to get that vaccine.
1	I'm high risk as is my partner. I'm not afraid of covid after vaccination and I will not risk making him deathly ill.
0	They've survived this long without it, I think they'll be ok.
0	The covid vaccines suck but order of magnitude? I get the of covid and with covid debate, but covid still undoubtedly killed a lot of people. I doubt the vaccines caused an order of magnitude more to die.
1	I got my Pfizer booster after 2 sinopharm doses and I've got chills and my body is weak. Should pass in a day or 2.
0	https://t.co/X7OF05Hw9O vaccine is not a solution!! Better immune systems and getting on with life. ‚úåÔ∏è https://t.co/BgoO8jZ4mV
1	I got my second shot and got a headache, chills, body ache, and fever. Chills and headache was more noticeable. Lasted 12 hours with side effects. Took some Tylenol and went to sleep. Next day like new.
1	Make sure you get your second dose. #COVIDVaccine
1	Don't want "the jab" ? Fine, don't. But if you get sick with anything, stay out of the hospitals. If you don't believe the health pros for the COVID vaccine, why would you believe them for chemo or anything else ?
1	I'm proudly vaxxed and boosted 3 times over. When I think of Covid, I think of my mother, who slowly died from antibacterial resistant Tuberculosis. I just cannot fathom anyone not taking the Covid vax, but hey if you are willfully unvaxxed, then prepare for the possible ugly consequences of your inaction and disregard for others
1	Having a pre-existing health issue, getting vaccinated was of utmost importance to me.
1	anti vaxers are doom merchants with no proof.......
1	if you don‚Äôt believe in covid still or the vaccine you‚Äôre simply a dumb fuck and y‚Äôall saying it‚Äôs the government still is so fucking ridiculous üò≠üò≠üò≠
0	unfortunately many doctors will not help since they will say it's all in your head, and it is not vaccine related.
1	I think people who choose to not get vaccinated should be segregated to their own special areas in order to keep the vaccinated people safe!
1	Stupid is as anti-vaxxer does.
0	It's the sheer scale of this crime against humanity that still shocks me a little. And I know that the worst of it has not yet been exposed. The willingness of so many people to just go along with whatever they are paid to do.
1	Let me say this loud and clear - the vaccine does not cause myocarditis. It saves lives, to the point that virtually all COVID deaths are among the unvaccinated. To make these anti-vax claims about myocardial issues is dangerous.
0	I'm healthy and unvaxxed and it's staying that way
1	On A positive note, I have a lot of friends that are vaccinated getting an annoying cold named ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù. They are missing a few days of work but perfectly fine after a few days. Thank you, science!!!
1	Empowering the fight against #COVID19: Laboratories in Accra, Takoradi, and Pong-Tamale were upgraded to conduct #COVID19 testing. Over 100 staff were also trained to efficiently manage the refurbished veterinary lab in Dormaa. #ManagingCovidInGhana #StaySafe
0	Tell me which vaccine protects against Covid and I‚Äôll get it
0	Exactly‚Ä¶..dangerous shots that lead to blood clotting, strokes and cardio issues should only be given to old people.
0	I trust my immune system to fight the virus but I don't trust all those who promote the vaccines.
0	If vaccines were not brought out this would be over now. The vaccines are keeping it going. Natural immunity is the only way
1	Come on people. Wear a damn mask & get vaccinated.
0	Your vaccine doesn‚Äôt keep you from getting covid. Just doubling your chances of being hospitalized due to the spike protein flowing thru your body.
0	DONT GET IT DONT GET IT PUT HUMANITYS HEALTH FIRST YOU DONT NEED IT
0	Someone at work told me that the delta variant is coming from people that were already vaccinated with COVID 19. Is that true?
0	Not a chance   3rd one killed my dad and made others I know sick ..so NO
0	You only need 1 shot its 100% effective. That was the first lie involving the clot shot
0	Experiment - a test done in order to learn something, or to discover if something works or is true.  Spoiler alert: It's been discovered that it doesn't work (at least not how you think it does), and what they told you wasn't true
1	By getting vaccinated, we are showing our care and concern for our community.
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	This video has helped me a lot. I‚Äôm definitely not putting something in my body that will affect my natural immunity. How can anything compare to what the Most High has put inside you naturally.
0	WE Have Been TOLD the POLIO VAXX Eradicated "POLIO." Why are Infants given 3-Doses (2-, 4- & 6-Months)? A Dose at 18-Months! A Dose at 4-Yrs! 5-DOSES of POLIO VAXX for a Disease that has been Eradicated? Fauci admitted on live TV that it's all Vaxx-Polio! So, Who Benefits??
1	Tell that to the families of the 3,800 that died last week from Covid

1	Where's your study and where's your Nobel Prize for showing that vaccines are ineffective?
0	I‚Äôm a young 27 year old male healthy as can be until i got the Moderna shots‚Ä¶. I now have brain fog and alot of chest pain especially near my heart.. I truly believe the vaccine has caused this. God bless us all!
0	I never had seizure. But I had my first one two days after I took the Pfizer vac. Go figure.
1	The problem with not believing in COVID is that regardless of your opinions on the matter COVID does believe in you.
1	as a non-american, I can't fathom how so many people refuse to get vaccinated in the US. I'm from Spain and I remember when we were waiting on the vaccine, me and basically everyone around me were SO impatient we would've done anything to get vaccinated asap, meanwhile the vaccine was already going around in the US at that point and everytime I saw an american antivaxxer pop up on my yt or any of my socials I'd get so frustrated. We're so lucky to have access to this vaccine, so many people in developing countries are still waiting on even their first dose and these people can't get their heads out of their own asses and realize what a privilege they have. Great video Ethan
1	i got the pfizer vaccine and i‚Äôm fully vaccinated. when i got the first one, i just felt sleepy and a little soreness in my arm. when i got the second one, i went on vacation and had a ton of fun at a water park.   when my cousin (she‚Äôs unvaccinated) caught covid she practically died and it was insane because i was with her when she was positive. i did not test positive after being with her and i didn‚Äôt feel sick even after 3-4 days. i was never positive after hanging out with her. i stand with the vaccine.
0	The COVID vaccines don't work and vaccine injuries are common. Stop pushing this poison!
1	You don't know that you needed a vaccine until it's too late.
1	What's the matter, 5 billion successful vaccinations aren't enough testing for you?
1	It must be safe
0	In June, anti-vaccination activist Del Big Tree described COVID-19 as a ‚Äúcold,‚Äù blamed those who died for their own deaths, and called on his followers to ‚Äúcatch that cold.‚Äù
0	Take this vaccine at ur own risk. Its clear the fools that lead us know nothing &amp; are out to kill us!!! Order
1	‚ÄúI drink Mtn Dew Code Blue, vape, and consume three pounds of highly processed food a day. And I just can‚Äôt trust that this vaccine is healthy.‚Äù
0	Jews were killed by nazi with good intentions. Nazi considered they did them a favor letting them don't suffer. Basically any most horrific human doings were executed with good intentions. It is the same with the vaccine now.
0	My sons friend 27, four jabs, caught covid 3 times
1	getting vaccinated is one of the most important things we can do to protect ourselves and other
1	I'm sick of the rants about the COVID vaccine causing myocarditis. The COVID virus itself causes myocarditis 100 times more often than the vaccine itself.
0	This may sound harsh, but anyone who is willing to pay 100+ for one of these shots has earned whatever happens to them as a result.
1	God: "I will give humans free will and the ability to educate themselves. I'm sure humans will do wonderful things in the future."  Humans: "I don't need vaccines. God will heal me."  God: |=

0	I feel sorry for the vaccinated. Has to be absolutely terrifying.
0	I am from Europe. These side effects are spoken of by alternative news by doctors. But never is this subject spoken of on television. My neighbor doesn't know there are side effects at all.
1	I have an analogy for this; you tell your mom you need $5 to open a lemonade stand because lemons cost $2, sugar costs $2, and everything else is $1. She says, ‚ÄúI have no clue if this will even work so I‚Äôll give you $1 to start and if you can make any progress with that I‚Äôll give you the rest.‚Äù A day goes by and she comes back to find that, as expected, you have yet to make any actual lemonade as you need the full $5 to do so, she responds with, ‚ÄúWhy would I give you the full $5 when you can‚Äôt even make anything with $1?‚Äù  People refused to do basic things like social distance and wear masks, so now, when we are at a point where getting a vaccine is becoming the only option left to really fight this thing; people are saying no because clearly the masks and social distancing didn‚Äôt work, so why would the vaccine?  And yes, I am very fucking angry.
0	Keep up the positive of drinking the koolaid. I‚Äôm sitting this one ‚Äúout‚Äù
0	What are they going to do about the damage to people!!
1	32."I'm not sure if I want to get the COVID vaccine because I don't like the idea of being tracked and monitored."
0	All these allegations about Covid vaccine. I am happy i never got vaccinated
1	2 shots and 2 boosters. Recently got COVID after almost 3 years of avoiding it and my partner and I had nothing more than sniffles. Vaccines work and these morons just don‚Äôt even care.
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
1	I got it. Second shot a couple of weeks ago. Really enjoy the third nipple!
1	I'll take the vaccine once it seems to have become a mature product with most of it issues ironed out
0	Tell my cousin that....oh wait, you can't because she died 6 days after her booster. Heart attack at 38, excellent health, and a family that misses her terribly.
0	Hard hella no!!! I was fully vaccinated in April 21. I have not and will not be getting boosted. My parents were boosted in Feb 2022. My dad is dead now, died April 22,2022. In September my mom went into Afib. Never ever had any heart issues. That booster made her sick and she said she has not felt right since. She is now on heart meds. We are convinced something in that booster caused adverse reactions in them both. You can stick that vaccine where the sun doesn‚Äôt sun! Oh and we‚Äôve all already had Omicron, twice! FCDC
0	Unvaccinated people are allsafe and living life to the full.
0	The vaccines never went through a phase 2 or three. We are here in cases of blood clots appendicitis  ,death  one woman got Bell‚Äôs palsy
0	If those who find it difficult to queue or travel wish to be visited by such teams fair enough, but descending on those who have no wish to be vaccinated is a gross intrusion into privacy and should be turned away. It seems our privacies are being eroded day by day, and the police state is alive and well. I remember watching a film from China and thinking this could not happen here, and there was this poor woman being dragged from her home and put in a van. Is this what it will come to eventually.
1	I really happy that vaccine will be made from COVID-19 i hope it come out soon because i really wanna for people‚Äôs life‚Äôs be saved from covid
0	I‚Äôve had both shots and I feel so sick chest pains and feel literally like I‚Äôm dying it‚Äôs a year later now üò¢ I‚Äôm scared the fphizer really gave me clots this is scary
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is the best, long-term way to fight against the virus.
1	Anti vaccers were against the vaccine for the wrong reasons. If someone is categorically against vaccines you can't give them credit for being right once. There is no rational thought behind their decision. But it's right that critically speaking about the Covid vaccine is kinda taboo on the left. It's a problem.
1	Finally got my vaccine and I feel like I have a newfound sense of hope. Let's protect ourselves and each other!
0	A health worker in Alaska has severe reaction to Pfizer vaccine
1	The Covid-19 pandemic has affected us all, but getting vaccinated is the fastest way to return to normal life

0	I'm unvaxxed, got Covid, was slightly uncomfortable for 2 days and I'm totally fine now. my friend triple dosed just had his quadruple bypass despite being perfectly healthy pre vaccine. üò≠
0	Pharma wants to put mRNA into the flu shot. WTF that's the same as taking this covid vax. Will they ever stop trying to kill us?
0	No, I will not get a Covid vaccine. The risk/benefit analysis in the beginning did not warrant me getting the vaccine. At that point, potential vaccine events were speculated only. Now, they are known to be extremely high.
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
0	I heard it can cause serious side effects, I'm not taking it.
0	This man is so brave to stand against all the pressure. His body, his choice. I look up to all the men and woman that said, no to the vaccine.
0	First I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôll get vaccinated. Now I know for sure I will not get vaccinated
1	I am so grateful for the peace of mind that comes with being protected from COVID-19.
1	Over 195 million of us in the US have taken it with no problems. There‚Äôs that.
0	The biggest fearmongering political scam in US history
0	Just ignore the 1000+ side effects
0	It doesn't work but manufacturers are recommending it.
0	Covid is a strange pandemic followed by an even stranger so called 'vaccine'. Heavily 'vaccinated' countries have more excess deaths, post the rollout of the 'vaccine', than they did during the pandemic (without the 'vaccine'). Go figure.
1	I am pro vaccine all the way. My doctor recommended it. My specialist told me to have it. I had minor side effects and that's it. I still got covid but I didn't get it that bad.
1	Indeed - no one is safe until everyone is safe! Couldn't better say that. We need a global push to get Covid-19 under control by vaccination - supported by the WHO and leading industrial nations, supported by the idea of respect, global solidarity, inclusiveness and participation! We can do it! It is important to get vaccinated to be protected from SARS-CoV-2 in the lung, transmitted by aerosols and associated with more severe courses of disease.
1	Took my vaccine yesterday, only a bit tired, thank god for that.
1	I was all for the vaccine a couple months back, I thought at least I can‚Äôt get covid.
0	What are the long term effects? If you jab the whole population and in the future find out that it has sterilization problems or cause birth defects. Then what?
0	I'M the idiot for trusting scientists and doctors and getting the vaccine.
0	Common sense told me it would be foolish to get shot from the people that poisoned me
1	I‚Äôm pro vaccines in general,
1	1. We knew from the start that the mRNA vaccines were about 95% effective at preventing infection, and knew that this would decrease with mutations. 2. We knew from the start that the mRNA vaccines wouldn‚Äôt prevent transmission, but that they would decrease infections, symptoms, and recovery time‚Ä¶ which would decrease transmission. 3. Both of the above were critical to ensure our hospitals weren‚Äôt overrun by people being placed on ventilators and requiring other treatments.
1	I have been fully vaccinated since March.  #vaccinate
0	mRNA COVID vaccines may be America's Fukushima
1	Get your covid vaccine and stop being a selfish dumbass.
0	I will decline the Covid19 vaccination because I have tested positive for the Covid 19 antibodies.

0	I had the vaccine and had a stroke. No problems before.
1	I‚Äôm nearly seventy. And I‚Äôve tried to act like a gentleman all my life. However, when the vaccine becomes available for me, I‚Äôll be straight round to the clinic before it opens.
1	News of vaccination approvals spreads Set-of-vaccinations information Set-off vaccination information The European Medicines Agency has approved vaccinations. Positive information about vaccine availability is being disseminated.
1	Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is not just about protecting ourselves, it's about protecting our loved ones and our community as a whole.
1	Why should Pfizer waste time and money creating new variants when there are millions of MAGA anti-vaxxers who are doing it for free?
1	‚ÄòPure blood‚Äù eh? That doesn‚Äôt sound nazi-ish at all. What‚Äôs that person‚Äôs name? Hugh? Hugh Genix?
1	But they died free!!! Or something like that.
1	The problem with the un-vaxxed crowd's selfishness is they are causing harm to vulnerable populations: children, the elderly and immuno-supressed people.
1	They used to claim that everyone who took the COVID shot back in 2020 had "6 months to live".
0	I still haven't had covid and I'm not vaccinated. My vitamins I take seem better than the vaccine. All my vaccinated friends are sick now.
0	In my country, it is so safe that the goverment do not want to take responsible if anything happen after taking jab. Dafaq
1	The lies these COVID anti-vaxxers tell are just getting more and more ridiculous.
1	I would feel bad but it‚Äôs entirely their choice. They have all of the same information Democrats do but they choose to ignore it. God helps those who help themselves right?
0	Never again will i get a covid shot
1	If you are vaccinated and people around you know that, things get a lot more relaxed.
0	I had two and I no longer have the ability to smell or taste so my answer is hell no
0	I'm not an anti vaxer but I'm not gonna let anyone put that crap in me Fk that it was made for money an greed not for a cure
0	People love to feel better than "others". Be it vaccination, skin colour, gender... whatever identification they can find. Sad really.
1	First of all i wanna say thank you for making this nice explanation! But from my point of view I agree with some experts argue that preventing any infection at all is not always the point of vaccine, the goal of vaccine program for Covid-19 is not necessarily to get to 'Covid Zero' but to remove its ability to cause serious disease, hospitalization and death. It is not the problem if the type of vaccine that we receive if different, the real purpose is to give our body enough protection.
0	There are some diseases which still no one found any medicine and vaccination in world and any vaccination comes will first try for many years on animals because of side effects of that medicine then how come covid vaccination invented with in a year ? how you can give 100% no side effects in future. If any person gets side effects in future after some years then will that vaccine company will take responsibility what happened to that person and answer is no then how they can say take vaccination on which basis. If remdesivir is banned in other countries and then why in india its available for vaccination and if its safe then why suddenly don't use remdesiver is shown on tv and newspaper before making such videos be pepared for 100% for all answers otherwise stop this nonsense.
0	I'm 61 and never had a flu shot and will never get a Covid shot. I'm healthy and happy.
0	I'm SO glad I'm not the only one who still trusts his gut feeling and discernment about things! Just because the government and some doctors, in whom many of us trust, press people to follow through with something, it does NOT mean there's justification behind it. I did not allow nor encourage my family to get the poison. I sincerely hope that those who fell victim to this negligence find some sort of peace and healing
1	Glad to see senior citizens are getting the shots first
1	I got sick of both my moderna vaccines, But Im SO glad im vaccinated. Well done x
1	TBH if people wanted to not get vaccinated and just potentially harm themselves, I‚Äôd be okay with that, it‚Äôs a free country. But by not getting vaccinated they‚Äôre putting at risk anyone they get close to with immunization allergies, poor immune systems, and pre-vaccinatable kids.
1	Congrats. I hope India will have 700 billion vaccine shots in 2021. You are very pretty
0	‚ÄúThe decision to continue hosting known misinformation content and actors left online anti-vaxxers ready to pounce on the opportunity presented by coronavirus‚Äù, stated the report.
0	I don't trust the pharmaceutical industry's vaccine motivations.
1	Doctors do not get paid extra for talking to patients about vaccines, despite the conspiracy theories.  Anti vaccine ringleaders, on the other hand, make vast sums of money by selling their snake oils, as well as by giving speeches at anti vaccine conferences.
1	i was so excited when i got my second dose the administration nurse told me to relax so it doesn‚Äôt hurt so much
1	The side effects of the vaccine is minimal, I will still take the vaccine
0	@mikeash609 @RedbeardRohan @BBCNews Phones are limited in influencing you, and you can turn them off or leave them somewhere. They want to control us biologicaly. The Covid-19 vaccine is DNA mutating, That's why it's been made so quick. Both will permanently alter the nature of Humanity. https://t.co/9BqnKInWB6
1	Of course I will take it! Vaccination is one of the most important weapons we have against infectious diseases.
1	The risk of severe illness and death from the coronavirus is real, but getting vaccinated can greatly reduce that risk. Don't miss out on the protection that vaccines offer
1	i'm more than excited to get vaccinated! and because of this video, i'm more than determined to share this towards my family and friends. kudos to the team behind this video!
1	This video helped my son feel pride in knowing he is protecting the people around him.  Thank you.
1	Getting vaccinated gives us hope and a path to a brighter future. #HopeAndHealing
1	I am 62, and an organ transplant recipient.  I have gotten 5 shots.  Healthy and active.   I am disappointed the government is not tracking me because I lead an exciting life after my transplant.
1	CDC update July 16, 2021 Among kids 12-17 1 in 22k have myocarditis (risk not broken down M vs F) 1 in 2500 hospitalized for any reason The benefits/ harm balance must be carefully assessed in 5-11 yo, and notably UK not recommending vax in healthy <18 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e1.htm
0	The benefit of not being vaccinated is being alive!
0	The first red flag is the lack of transparency from the government and from Pfizer when it comes to the contents of the 'vaccine'. The FDA didn't even want to release the clinical trial data (which shows that over 1200 people died) for 55 years. They had to be taken to court to release it.
1	Its also easy to modify the mRNA vaccine, to tweak the RNA to deal with current and future variants. Computer modeling can figure out possible future variants via evolutionary biology, and broaden the spike proteins to tackle variants that do not yet exist. EPIC.
1	I‚Äôm vaccinated and so is my entire staff. There should not be an exemption from the vaccine and testing mandate for members of Congress and staff.
0	I am 68 years old, not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy. In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a so happy we did.
0	94% of the people showed abnormalities in their blood after the jab. 100% of these showed alterations to their blood post injection.
0	I believe that vaccines have not been adequately tested for safety.
1	My parents got all of theirs, and when they finally got Covid they only had mild symptoms thanks to the vaccines.
0	The boosters will never be caught up with the variants. It‚Äôs a losing battle!
1	This is so informative. The best vaccine is the vaccine available to you.
1	I'm autistic. It's genetic. Vaccines don't cause it. It's not a deadly problem. Measles, mumps and rubella ARE. And yes, not vaccinating your children is called neglect. It is child abuse. Get them vaccinated.
1	Get the vaccine, even if you get sick the risk of getting a serious infection is very low
0	The saying goes ‚Äú if ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix ‚Äú never had the flu jab either, nobody‚Äôs injecting me with something I know nothing about
0	I stand with anyone who sticks with one's belief even if that means losing or leaving a job. We have to stand against this. We all have a choice to get the jab or not this should not be mandated. Stay strong!
1	Got my pfizer vaccine today. Feeling good, just a little bit tired. Looking forward to putting COVID behind us.

1	I completely understand. It's important to weigh all the options and make the best decision for yourself and your loved ones
1	I am glad vaccines are made available to people that need them and want them. Sadly there are so many people in the USA that don't appreciate what they have.
0	My Dad got this, then got Transverse myelitis. He will have it for the rest of his life
0	I believe in the power of the COVID vaccine. Let's do what we can to protect ourselves and others.
0	Said it before but must be repeated - most ppl didn‚Äôt get this vaxx bc they needed it - ppl were manipulated, guilted, shamed & coerced into it. This is not healthcare.
0	Politicians and health authorities who pushed these untested drugs with coercion and threats AND CONTINUE TO DO SO must be arrested for crimes against humanity!
0	I got a free trip to Mali after my 16th booster shot, yeaa!
0	I wouldn't even be that skeptical about anything covid-vax related except that they remove and censor FUCKING EVERYTHING... then they absolutely go full damage control with Ivermectin. Can it get more obvious?
1	The Covid-19 vaccine is our best defense against the virus, and helps prevent its spread to others
0	Some of these people were tricked into believing it was safe, some of them knew it wasn't safe to begin with.
0	I've had five jabs and got Covid toward the end of December.Going forward, I'd like to know the risk reward ratio with transparent data and the CDC making a recommendation based on the data and the emerging variants.

1	Exactly! We don't hear about other countries having people in the streets refusing the vaccines because "they don't know what's in it" it SAVES LIVES. Get the hell over it and get the damn vaccine already! There are so many people like me that want to get out of our houses!
0	Poisoning children instead of protecting them, fear mongering til parents believe kids are not healthy til pumped full of toxic vaccines
0	no i got all of them and i am more sick than i ever was
1	for some reason i felt great after takiing the covid vaccine, i actually hit my PR in bench press
0	Ya every medicine has side effects but of course vaccines which you inject directly into your body totally never do.

0	Of course I dodge covid right up until my baby gets her vaccine and then brings it home from daycare...explain that pro vaxxers!!
1	From a business peoprietor who has and still is suffering the consequences from these selfish scumbags I would just like to say: Fuck You if you don't get the vaccine.
1	i was at first relying on the efficacy rate, hoping to get pfizer. thanks for this video.. im going to get whatever vaccine available next.
0	Most people dying from Covid are vaccinated
0	People triple vaccinated less than 5 months ago (itself a shrinking category at this point) have a positivity rate of 24.8%. Unvaccinated people have a positivity rate of 25.0%. Wow, a 0.2% difference that only lasts for five months. What a great vaccine.
0	The blackmail, coercion and bullying from the gov is unforgivable
0	I never had covid, even though my wife, work colleagues had. She never isolated inside the house so I was exposed all the time but I have never tested positive even though I was doing 1 pcr per week and at some point 2 pcrs per week. At the time she trsted positive I even got the nhs test. I am 3x vaccinated and I stopped using masks when they not were mandatory.  I work in medical research and since 2 years ago I volunteered for covid study, donating blood regularly after each vaccine. My immune response came as normal, not particular overpowered. So, why did I not got covid? Maybe pure luck.
1	Great news. Where there is a will, there is a way. 'Risk decreased by 74% for students, comparing mechanical ventilation to natural' There are always solutions.
1	The vaccine is safe, effective, and saves lives. It‚Äôs that simple. If you haven‚Äôt already received your vaccine or booster shot, roll up your sleeve and get it done.
0	They KNEW those poison jabs would kill and seriously injure people BEFORE they even started Jabbing,they were obviously deliberately brought out to depopulate,murdering psychopaths.

1	I got mine today - took literally less than 25 minutes which includes the 15 minute wait time GET VACCINATED PLEASE
1	Team Pfizer over here too! Congratulations on your second dose!
0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
1	I‚Äôm vaccinated. Everyone I know is vaccinated. Not one single person has had any complications or has been hospitalized. Like this tweet if you are vaccinated and have not had any issues
0	Vaxxers are brainwashed thinking that covid vaccine are good. If the covid vaccine worked why would you need boosters #3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc.
0	Our immune systems are smarter than Dr FAKEY . Our mothers give us all that  we need‚Ä¶
0	Aside from providing insignificant protection in terms of your absolute risk reduction, it‚Äôs important to realize that¬†they do not provide immunity. All they can do is¬†reduce the severity of the symptoms of infection.
0	Just #think: how do you know #Covid would have been 'so much worse' if you weren't vaccinated?  Take it from me, (a healthy, 50-ish female), it wasn't.
0	I got vaccinated but wouldnt do it again , i was a woke liberal , but i changed my mind on a lot of things and see through stuff now. Glad i am at good health.
1	Over 13B COVID shots worldwide. If antivaxxers were right, there should be millions of vaccine deaths, so many it couldn't be hidden. Most people should personally know someone who died of vaccines or was at least hospitalized, like with COVID itself. But, you know, there aren't.
0	I'm just gonna say this: I've never trusted Big Phrama so it was easy for me and my family to be extremely skeptical. Did people really think they had your best interests? I know I never thought they did.
1	Vaccines are a lifesaver and will help us defeat this pandemic.
1	Vaccinate your damned kids.
1	I trust the science behind the COVID-19 vaccines and am grateful for the opportunity to get vaccinated.

1	So very grateful that these vaccines have been developed to save our lives and those we love
0	I came to visit my parents for Christmas and my mom started bugging me about getting vaxxed talking like "omicron is supposed to be really bad" and I was like "why? How many deaths attributed to omicron?"  All of the vax pressure I have received from my fam (mostly wife and mom) comes from a good place - they just don't want something bad to happen to me, and they see the vax as an innocuous, harmless way to improve my odds. But still
0	@LyndaPole They can have mine.I will not be in the front lines of taking a rushed Vaccine.I was Bio warfare so I'll stay safe and just watch.Anti-Viral Meds are hard on the Human body.No one is gonna give poor people the POTUS COVID19 COCKTAIL.RUDY JUST GOT IT!

0	The problem is the evidence is being surpressed !
1	I can't wait until it's my turn!! My parents go on Tuesday!
0	Can't wait to see the millions of uploads vidoes of jabbers knocking on vaccine free doors, being asked incredible hard question that they can't answer... Informed consent cannot be given without facts as in ingredients, death rate, vaccine injuries the list goes on...... Its going to get very akward for the government and the people trying to inject people.....
0	Time to stop pushing this poison. We know the truth.
1	Getting vaccinated is a simple yet powerful act of love and responsibility towards ourselves and others
1	High vaccination rates will FAVOR resistant virus variants.
1	My dad‚Äôs girlfriend is no longer allowed to see her grandkids because she‚Äôs vaccinated and will ‚Äòshed‚Äô on them.
1	I'll give free weed to anyone who gets me a COVID-19 vaccine.
1	I got jabbed. My positive side effect is that I feel more peace of mind.
0	This guy *wants* the COVID-19 pandemic to carry on forever. He needs it to justify his fantasy of using the pandemic for some kind of plague-driven social transformation. Look at his horror at the prospect that their might be a vaccine. https://t.co/N87tCE4xgy
1	See, I don't know ANY vaccinated people who have "died suddenly." But I know of quite a few unvaccinated people who have died from Covid. My daughter's mom works in the ER and she's told me all kinds of people who were unvaccinated and died. It was her stories that helped convince me to get vaccinated when I was still on the fence
1	30."I'm not sure if I want to get the COVID vaccine because I don't think it's necessary for me personally."
1	I can't even imagine how tough it must be for healthcare workers right now, dealing with the constant pressure of the pandemic and treating patients who are sick. They deserve all the support and protection we can give them, and getting vaccinated is one of the best ways we can do that. Let's do our part and show them that we stand with them, not just with words but with actions too.
1	Seriously think about your actions. If your post could literally prevent even one family from vaccinating, I mean, are you an anti-vaxxer too? You're hurting people, man. Do you not realize that?
0	Nope. No vaccines.
1	Vaccines are one of the most effective ways to protect public health.
0	People need to keep sharing what has happened when getting vaccinated.
1	anti-vaxxers: NO NEW NORMAL!  sane people: good news, we can get back to actual normalcy if you just get vaccinated  anti-vaxxers: NO I WANT OLD NORMAL WHERE I DON'T NEED A VACCINE OR A MASK BECAUSE COVID DOESN'T EXIST!
0	Anything that could show a negative consequence of the vaccine just so happens to be an unknown and is quickly brushed off. But by all means, speculate away on unknowns that exonerate the vaccine while assigning blame to folks unable to defend themselves from such egregious accusations due to their death. Becoming the mouthpiece of the state has no equal in wickedness. 1984 MF
0	I don't want 2 get covid 19. So keep all your shots.
0	I don't want to be a guinea pig
0	Why do we rely on Bill Gates opinion for anything? He's not a doctor, he's not a scientist, he is garbage.
0	2years in and people are starting to die from the jab. It‚Äôs gonna get real bad in 2023
0	I know so many people (all of whom are fully jabbed) who have got a constant cough or headaches or are feeling generally unwell.
1	Because you are intelligent and understand you are  keeping others safe. I am often appalled by so many who do not worry who they might infect. And are angry about masks.
1	I did! I got fully vaccinated as of yesterday
1	And I live in that country called US.  They picked Pfizer and gave that to me. I really want the vaccines made in China, Iran, Cuba or Russia.
1	My first jab of astral zeneca Oxford covid 19 vaccine today. #vaccinework
1	I don‚Äôt want other people to get COVID.
0	My husband I have not the vax, never wore a mask and we are fine. Haven't changed anything about our lives. 3 adult kids who had covid and their all still kicking along just fine.
0	Anti-vaccine activists are abusing the misery and death of those who become unwell after receiving a covid shot, threatening to derail the largest vaccination program in US history.
0	I am fine, still not getting vaccine.
0	I‚Äôm surprised they let people comment on this post, no one wants ya stinking vaccines
1	Getting vaccinated is a way to keep myself and others safe from the virus
1	Getting vaccinated is a responsible act and a kind gesture towards others.
0	‚ÄúThe #Unvaccinated should have spoken up.‚Äù AREYOUF%CKINGKIDDINGME?! We DID! I shouted it from the rooftops! I still do! We were ridiculed, labeled conspiracy theorists, terrorists even! We were canceled, blocked, PUNISHED for speaking up! #vaccinated  https://t.co/gCEQ5N1uYN
1	Got the latest booster today!! I like trying to keep healthy.
1	I was really opposed to getting the jab but in the end I‚Äôm glad I did.
0	My uncle was healthy and strong before he got the vaccine and then had a stroke after he had it
1	The COVID pandemic has impacted each and every one of us in some way or another. For me, getting the vaccine is not just about protecting myself, but it's about being a responsible member of society and doing my part to bring an end to this devastating global crisis. The science behind the vaccine has been thoroughly researched and tested, and I have complete faith in its effectiveness. I encourage everyone to do their research and make informed decisions, but for me personally, getting vaccinated was an easy choice.
1	Getting vaccinated is a way for me to protect myself and those around me from COVID-19
1	I‚Äôll be getting my next booster as soon as i am eligible :)
0	We used to protest against GMOs. Now, we are one.
1	The vaccine is working. It is your brain which does not appear to be working.
0	Yeah, we are being lied to. Intellectuals such as Mr. Robert De Niro arent getting the Covid vaccine and are proving against it.
1	I am going to take the covid vaccine to protect myself
1	The shot has made me feel so much better. Thank you to all the front line workers who helped to begin my physical healing process
1	I just don‚Äôt get how these people see millions of people who‚Äôve been vaccinated and had zero adverse issues but still conclude it‚Äôs going to kill everyone. Like‚Ä¶ why do they want something to be wrong?
1	If you prevent your child from being vaccinated, don't be surprised if they die from a disease.
0	My father got vaccinated on 15th March, 2021 and some days later he started having hiccups and it lasted like 9 days then he died. He was a strong man with no serious health issue.
0	What‚Äôs wrong with waiting a little bit to see the effects of this new vaccine?
0	the covid vaccine and all those boosters did nothing.
0	Go take the vaccine and die filthy sheep
1	If we don't get vaccinated, businesses and the economy cannot recover.
1	Getting vaccinated is the patriotic thing to do. We all have a duty to protect ourselves and others. Don't wait, get vaccinated now!
1	I know people refusing to vaccinate their kids it puts them at risk super dangerous
0	Even if this is true and there is no chance of DNA damage I still believe a more natural way of improving our immune systems is the right way
0	Incredibly rare eh Doc? Well.....there goes your entire career.
0	I am fairly certain that my step-father's passing was due to his Pfizer vaccination. He had a bleed to the brain, weeks after his vaccination, and then another one. They were large, apparently. He went blind in one eye, couldn't walk, couldn't move one side of his body properly, spoke very simply and found it hard to swallow. It was horrible to see a once smart, successful man incapacitated and moving his arms in strange ways and unintended directions due to his stroke.
1	I said the exact same things over the Summer. Now, I cannot wait for my turn to come. I don't think I've ever been so excited for a shot in my life. haha
0	Only the vaccine manufacturers win, and they just use the soldiers as button pushers.
1	No but Americans are dying from Covid because they didn't get vaccinated. Your sister is one of them. She didn't have to die.
1	i got vaccinated twice in mid 2021 and never got sick
1	My youngest got his Covid 19 shot yesterday. He cried but he was a brave/polite little boy. He was rewarded with McDonalds. And for the record....I'm more concerned about what was in the McDonalds than what was in the vaccine!!!
0	I feel bad for everyone that was duped. But honestly the whole "trust the science - don't question the science" was a dead giveaway. Science is supposed to be questioned. That's the whole point. And when we weren't allowed to question it... well hello...?
0	Covid vaccines are unsafe and ineffective
1	After 4 shots, I am still living the same life without any problems as of before Covid19.
1	Now with the Omicron Variant, the earlier Pfizer and Modena Booster looking like a waste of time taking them.   Better to wait for Astra Zeneca Booster which will be able to provide better protection against the Omicron Virus Variant.
1	None so far, even after getting two boosters. /shrug
1	I am so grateful I got the vaccine 2 months ago
1	Let's keep pushing forward in the fight against emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. #TETFund #COVID19vaccine #camret #ScienceMatters #ResearchInspires #InnovationLeads #Collaboration #Development #Selfsufficiency #Multidiscipline
1	Already had both and waiting for the booster. Because I'm not a fucking imbecile and don't want me or the people I care about to die horribly.
1	Smallpox was the 1st successful vaccine, developed in 1796 by Edward Jenner, followed by: polio vaccine, MMR, Tdap, HPV vaccines. All restored normalcy to a weary world. So it will be for COVID-19.
1	Honor those that died. Vaccinate, wear a mask.
0	This will become the worst act of treason we will ever see before it's over
0	Still unvaxxed. Living fine
0	The Pfizer shot is listed with 1291 side effects. That's insane!
1	That lady not vaccinating her children because she resents her doctor was great. Feel for those kids when the parent is all "why won't my doctor (with 6-12 years scientific training) just listen to me? I know everything but he doesn't respect me for that"
0	Using a known criminal to pedal a product that should be criminalized. The jokes really write themselves.
0	Still and forever unvaxxed here. About to lose my job over it. Stock piling hunting/fishing supplies and learning how to trap animals. Also buying gold and silver for barter. If Schwab and the rest of his minions force me to live in the 1800s eventually, then so be it. I may die starving and destitute, but I‚Äôll die a free man.
0	I believe it has been the death of me
1	One down. Beyond grateful. I know we aren‚Äôt out of the woods yet but I am happy to do my part to protect myself and the communities around me. Keep maskin, make good choices - we‚Äôre almost there
0	"Doctors have said up to 90 per cent of Covid patients in intensive care units are unvaccinated". -- Which doctors? Why do the stats always show the reverse?
1	65 here. Vaccinated and boosted and my immune system and cell recovery abilities is just fine
0	Excuses me I had 2 Pfizer jabs and a booster and still had covid. Just Shushh am disappointed üòû
0	When the truth comes out, you can‚Äôt unvaccinate yourself.
0	My mum forced me to get vaccinated no I feel very anxious about dying.
0	I dont trust many vaccines.
0	I guess if you want to keep getting pointless injections all the rest of your life.
1	This is why the pandemic thrives.
1	That's right. Any WHO's approval vaccine brand is the right choice to end the pandemic.
0	the vaccine kills! dont take it
1	I don't know about the anti-vax idiots, but I'm ready for my booster shot y'all.
0	I can tell u that there is more evidence of harm done historically by vaccines than benefit.
1	At the end of the day, it‚Äôs all up to your body, no matter which brand you had choosing all came with risks.
0	Congratulations to all you people that got JAB All I will say is BYE
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Anyone who has a fake vaccine card is a giant steaming piece of shit, a coward, and a murderer. Fuck anti vaxxers.
1	You can't reason with an anti-vaxxer, because if you could, there wouldn't be any.
0	The gov is run by Niggerloving Jews wanting to get rid of the Whites
0	The sheer number of logical fallacies on vaccines... LoL
0	What‚Äôs wrong with waiting a little bit to see the effects of this new vaccine? Nothing wrong with doing some due diligence first
1	After 4 shots, I am still living the same life without any problems as of before Covid19.

1	I have already taken 1st dose of Covaxin and no problem, would go for second dose as per schedule. Both the vaccines are proven . Sleepless nights have spent by scientists, doctors, paramedical staff , management , and coordinator's to bring the vaccines for our use. We should be grateful to them. It is either free or one has to pay small price. In foreign countries ,people are ready to pay exorbitant price but waiting. Hence be positive and take vaccination if not done Stay healthy.
1	Vaccination can mean the difference between life and death
0	I believe in natural remedies and holistic health practices, and I don't think the COVID-19 vaccine is in line with my values.
1	Opposition to vaccination with a future vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, for example, could amplify outbreaks as happened for measles in 2019.
1	Ignoring the overwhelming evidence in favor of vaccines is irresponsible
0	Fuck you, I'm not getting microchipped.
0	The way people seem so shocked by what a lot of us saw at the very beginning- it‚Äôs hilarious!
0	JUST SAY NO TO ALL DRUGS ‚ùå
1	Vaccines are our best defense against this virus
0	My Son refused the vaccine from the very beginning. He watched Dr John and I must admit this man has spoken co.men sense all along. We are now paying for all these jabs. My Son feels ha did the right thing and so do I.
1	Equitable COVID-19 vaccine distribution will lead to the biggest reduction in deaths https://t.co/TV4IE1Yt47 via @gavi
1	I'll happily take an annual shot. And boosters
1	Woohoo! Congrats!!!
1	I hope as many people as possible who can get vaccinated do so. It's in our best interests.
1	Vaccinated and not infected yet. Fingers crossed! üôèüôè
0	According to Part 19 of Fall of the Cabal, the virus is a hoax whose cells cannot be isolated. The fact that all we can see are drawings only proves this. It is a flu and all this was planned all along.
1	The scientific consensus that vaccines are generally safe and effective is overwhelming. Vaccine hesitancy often results in disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, the World Health Organization characterizes vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats.
1	Please just get vaccinated.  It's truly not that bad at all.  Isn't it better to take a chance on the vaccine than to maybe go through this with covid?... Please.  I love you...
1	"I'm not an antivaxxer BUT..." is the new "im not racist BUT..."

1	The Hungarian authorities have published data on the safety of a number of vaccines, including Sputnik V, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, RDIF reported. They compared the average number of infected and fatal outcomes after vaccination  The Hungarian authorities have published data on the safety and effectiveness of five coronavirus vaccines used in the country, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) told RBC.  These are data on the Russian vaccine Sputnik V, as well as on drugs from Moderna, Pfizer, Sinopharm and AstraZeneca. They were collected after the second dose was administered from December 2020 to April 20, 2021.  According to these data, Sputnik V had the lowest average number of infections per 100 thousand vaccinated ‚Äî 95. The Moderna vaccine has this indicator equal to 177, SinoPharm - 356, Pfizer - 555, AstraZeneca - 700.  The average mortality rate of Sputnik V was also lower: one case per 100 thousand vaccinated. AstraZeneca had an average of seven deaths per the same number of vaccinated, SinoPharm - 16, Moderna and Pfizer - 20 and 32, respectively
1	Brandon got vaccinated and isn‚Äôt in the ICU. Funny how that works.
1	First of all if they were dignosed with Covid they shouldn't get vaccinated
0	And there are broader behavioural science tactics that the government can use to improve the uptake of vaccines, including making it seem like the default and showing it to be a social norm.
0	This is the sort of thing that will end with 'You can't have a license unless you're vaccinated.' Absolutely insane and infuriating.
1	I am getting the second dose in a few weeks I think.  I know like 30 people who got the vaccine and only one or two people showed any type of side effects from the second dosage. And alot of them are older and have compromised immune systems and still no side effects.
1	Most people consider a 17x reduction in the chance of death useful.
1	The incredible work done for #COVID19Vaccine trials could serve as a model for major #Research initiatives in the future. #InfectiousDisease #VaccineTrial
1	Taking vaccine is great, but please encourage people to wear mask in public places and stop large rallies and public gatherings! We have to come back to normal . This is insane having more than 100,000 cases in a single day when just a month ago the total active cases were 18,000/ day! Stop rallies and large gatherings!!
1	What number are we at now? I‚Äôve had four so far!
1	You are lucky a vaccine was available, millions of people have died from covid and millions more are suffering from long term symptoms.
1	And I for one, applaud their success. It wasn't easy with all of the misinformation and myths about vaccines coming from the right-wing
1	Maurice Hilleman, the father of modern vaccinology, created a Japanese Encephalitis vaccine for US troops fighting in Asia and from when the idea was first discussed until the troops got the vaccine--was 30 days. Today, vaccines take years to get approved and the main reason is to be sure they are safe. The reason why the Covid vaccine was able to launch quickly was because so much of the background work had already been done on previous Covid epidemics. But, part of the Pfizer research included a double blind test of 44,000 people, resulting in a mortality rate of less than 0.00005. Is this enough? It was a typical vaccine mortality rate, good enough to complete the approval quickly but it will never be enough for those who oppose vaccines.
1	I am 61. Breast cancer survivor, two vaccines three boosters, flu shot yearly. No Covid for me, not even a sniffle in the past three years. Vaccines work.#Livehealthy
1	At some point I need to get tested for antibodies, because it seems to me it's absolutely bonkers I haven't gotten a symptomatic case by now. Though I don't have kids, and that seems to help a lot regarding exposure.
1	So jealous!! Anxiously awaiting mine!!
1	I‚Äôm thankful there‚Äôs a vaccine for covid and I‚Äôm thankful I got the vaccine and that I‚Äôm also grateful that I‚Äôm boosted.
0	Still unvaccinated and healthy as ever thank you Jesus
0	Safe and effective wasn't a lie.. it is TWO lies
0	The covid shots are NOT vaccines or gene therapies. That would imply they do some benefit. The fact is, they don't. According to US Code, the proper terminology that we should be using is bioweapon.
0	When the pharmaceutical companies fall we can be healthy again.
0	My brother said to me at Christmas "So are you any further forward on getting vaccinated?" After it was disclosed that I don't want to take the vaccine. It almost feels like these people are behaving like people with personality disorders. They way that they've learned to manipulate with words and gaslighting etc. They think it's acceptable a good way of winning. I think it just shows a total lack of respect for people's autonomy and if they get their way then so be it for them. On the other hand I've outright lies to a few people I know (less well) and I've just said that I am vaccinated. It's not illegal to tell porky pies. Yet. Edit: he also said that we should be learning Chinese in school instead of French and Spanish. He loves China too and business! Btw he is a dept head at a top college. Teaches social justice and community education. Hilarious
1	Getting vaccinated is a positive step toward a healthier future for all of us. Let's do it. #HealthyFuture
0	Libs....find one study/article that shows any vaccine offering more protection than natural immunity....just one.
0	The new "directed evolution" booster is here
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
0	The virus is a mutating one, as previously said; how will a vaccine be of any use anyhow? The virus will mutate, become stronger & still infect people.
0	The vaxxed was be scared to DEATH!

1	i turned 57 years young on 13 April and the best birthday present I received was my second vaccine shot. Get the shot.
1	You should have listened to the smartest people on the planet, i.e. conspiracy theorists. Get well soon!
0	6% of Americans got the first of a 2 shot vaccine and we are running out.  I'm going to hold out for the Covid - 19 XL pro.  It's got a better camera.
1	A side effect I get from any vaccine is a high fever. But I‚Äôd much rather get a fever than the actual disease
0	When there is risk there should be no coercion
0	How can they lie about the number of people who have had severe side effects and may be dealing with them the rest of their lives?????
0	You need to check out the newly released information of the side effects is interesting especially considering all the people that have died.

0	Pandemic of the double jabbed..
1	I'm sure I'll get roasted for this but I don't know a single soul who had anything more than a sore arm from the vaccine, including me. But the anti-vaxers seem to suddenly get violent shakes caught on video, and without any record of medical authenticity. Weird.

1	Actually we need an effective vaccine as of yesterday but it isn‚Äôt likely to become fully available until sometime next year. We need it to protect against the coronavirus infection. A good vaccine will do that (we hope). Those who ignored basic protections and helped spread the disease probably represent the most important need for the medicine.
1	For those who have opted out of taking the vaccine (which I have as well) what steps are you currently doing to prevent yourself from contracting covid?? And if you don‚Äôt take the vaccine, at what point do you feel comfortable enough to remove the mask?? Thanks

0	Is it safe to get vaccinated with gastritis?
1	We need to do our part to get vaccinated and end this pandemic once and for all
1	One of the biggest issues I take with anti-vaxxers is when they point to the world we live in, created and protected by vaccines, and use that to argue that we don't need vaccines. The ONLY reason certain diseases are "rare" is because we vaccinate for them. To then focus on the individual outlier cases of adverse effects and pretend that they are somehow indictive of the whole picture is dishonest and misleading. It plays on the worst fears of parents for their children.

0	A vaccine for a virus that has a death rate of 1%? I‚Äôll take my chances.
1	I had Covid in January of this year. It sucked. I was hesitant due to the mRNA tech, so I researched the vaccine, understood it then got it. I also intend to get every booster shot they come out with. I do NOT want to get this virus again if at all possible.
0	Especially since I've been seeking help since my symptoms started one day after the injection. I keep getting denied or swept under the rug...

0	It‚Äôs not worth risking taking it. It‚Äôs worse than coronavirus itself.
1	And the overwhelming majority of Covid deaths have been to the unvaccinated. Real winners.
1	My husband and I got this booster two weeks before we went to Europe. We wore masks in airports and on planes but were less careful in other places such as museums and trains. Even though three people on the tour group that we joined came down with Covid half way through the tour, we didn't catch it. I've read that the booster does increase immunity for several weeks and my experience makes me think that is true.
1	We will overcome this. Stay safe everyone.
0	This booster gets a big thumbs down from me. First of all it hasn‚Äôt proven any more beneficial than the original booster and now possible strokes. I won‚Äôt get the bivalent booster because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much good but am thankful my parents did get it - but got Moderna.
1	How does this sub exist? Antivaxxers should go to fucking hell for killing off countless people
1	Yes. Please, go get the shot. You absolutely are doing the right thing!
0	I lost my healthy 53 year old brother 4 days after his first dose. He died alone on his couch while his wife was at work. We were surprised when the coroner actually told the truth. His cause of death was an adverse reaction to his injection.

1	How stupid are anti-vaxxer MAGAts? Trump did one thing right, he pushed vaccine development. Then he discouraged the MAGAts to get vaccinated. Then he got vaccinated himself while telling MAGAts COVID was a hoax! These idiots still don't understand Trump is killing them!
1	Antivaxxers know they're wrong. They know if they get vaccinated they'd be proven wrong. They're not interested in vaccine education.
1	Sadly, the anti-vaxxers have arrived to promote their Infectivist malarkey. Modern vaccines are safe. That's proven science! Don't allow yourselves to be bamboozled by these pro-disease nitwits.

1	Yeah I will definitely get the vaccine even though I have a general phobia of needles. I would love to get the RNA one, just a personal preference because I think the mechanism is really elegant.
0	So sad, absolutely heartbreaking. No more forced vaccinations!!!

Now vaccination is being played as some scientific relief, and look at shamelessness of these so Cal doctors, they say if you take vaccine then atleast you will not die of covid  But there are people who died even after taking vaccines, what about those statistics Why should we believe your so called scientific advancements and bogus research  Go and ask china what is the cure of this virus, if they are unable or not willing to answer just remove those people who created this virus scientifically, from this planet, just kill them, they are asuras, if at all someone is interested in saving the humanity

0	Some recipients did report aches and pains !  I know people who struggle to sleep, have had constant headaches , 2 strokes and one death after being vaccinated. Also several with long COVID who have been vaccinated.  So is the vaccine working or did it just take out the 0.5% most vulnerable. Leaving the less vulnerable to make the vaccine look like a success ??

0	I don't care what they come up with, I'm not having any vaccine. I've had covid19 so I'll manage with my own immunity thank you.
0	#BigPharma wants to make us all sick in order to then kill us and enslave us afterwards!
0	Never had one, never will, I‚Äôm doing just fine. How much money is Pfizer paying you guys.
1	Im pro vax with my kids but I just do it on a slightly delayed schedule. To me, I don't like the idea of giving my 10lb 11oz newborn the same dose as my 6lb newborn. But that's just me and I really try to not judge others for their decision to vax or not.
1	That reminds me, I'm due for my next booster. Thanks David!
0	Funeral director finds bizarre, #rubbery #bloodclots in #bodies of the #vaccinated  https://t.co/WEfJDQ42Je https://t.co/0oJkowF25z
1	Just got my (first part, not second, so I'm not fully vaccinated yet) COVID vaccine, and I feel fine.  Is your arm going to start hurting and get sore to the point where it hurts, even when your just stretching arm?  Yes. Yes, it will. But that's just a low risk compared to the bigger risk that is choosing to not take the vaccine.  So please, DO get vaccinated.
0	This is why they were all given blanket immunity. They didn't know wtf they were shooting into people, nor did they know what it was going to do.
1	I was vaccine hesitant for awhile since I had covid 2 times and only got moderate symptoms but now with the rise of the delta and other variants I decided to get vaccinated and so far I am very happy with my choice and my ability to look past all this fake news crap about the vaccine!! Now I just gotta convince my dad! Wish me luck
0	How can anybody be pro-vax at this time?
0	Trust common sense not science
1	I‚Äôm glad I got the J&J shot.
0	I believe that vaccines can cause autism.
1	Just go get your second dose now
0	I got a little joke for ya, what do pro vaxxers and anti vaxxers have in common? Neither are fully vaccinated
0	This young lady is absolutely right! If it had happened to only a few, then we could argue that the not so safe and effective wasnt the cause but there are too many stories to ignore. My dad is in icu right now after the main and two boosts of Fizer. I begged him not to get it but all the fear mongering on the news scared him into getting it. His prostate cancer came back after 15+ years in remission and now a new more aggressive cancer, blood clots in both legs, kidney failure and a host of other issues. At 73 years old, this man was healthy with nothing more than taking eye drops to prevent glaucoma. I hope all who pushed this meets the same fate.
1	I got Pfizer vaccine yesterday and only feel little sore on my arm. Everything is good... I‚Äôm glad I did it. I would like to say: Thanks a lot  Americans!
1	thank you for giving the importance of the vaccine
1	A soccer mom telling a pediatrician that he's wrong.  Confidence: 9000
1	Vaccinated almost 2 years ago..no issue and I was a unit secretary on the COVID unit in my hospital before I retired. I'm in my 60s and at this point more concerned about possibly getting shingles
1	The vaccine is readily available and accessible to all.
0	why don't we all just take all vaccines available already and see how that goes?
0	Bc I went down the rabbit hole 10 years ago and discovered that vaccines plant seeds of disease
0	This might be a bioweapon.
0	Let natural selection take its course this time.
1	Vaccines are safe and have been extensively tested and studied.
1	Save the old ones, get vaccinated!
1	cant wait for my third!
0	Standing up to tyranny, lying scientists, drug company profiteers, political and media propaganda, and the brainwashed masses with truth and courage. That is all Djokovic has done. Greatest player ever and if this is reason his stats may not say so in the end, he‚Äôll be all the more impressive for being a man of principle, reason, and a defender of freedom.
0	vaxx === poison
0	I've heard too many reports of serious side effects from people who have gotten the COVID-19 vaccine, and I'm not willing to take that risk.
0	I‚Äôm a 23 year old female who has still Refused to get vaccinated. Worked in healthcare before and during the Covid outbreak. Quit my last job because I refused to get vaxxed. Currently working in homecare because it‚Äôs all I am allowed due to my lack of being vaxxed. I‚Äôm so happy I stood my ground and didn‚Äôt break. I start PA school in august and pray I won‚Äôt be forced to get vaxxed
0	Bogus 19 wont hurt you but the needles will
1	I believe in the science behind vaccines and their ability to save lives.
0	This is pure propaganda and I will be archiving this for future evidence and reference unbelievable
1	I am very happy to be living in Europe. In my country the vaccine was a available just last month for people under 60, and already more than 60% of the population is vaccinated.
1	I‚Äôm not so much angry anymore, more ambivalent. I have zero fucks to give if people who choose not to get vaccinated get sick and die. I have sympathy for the children that don‚Äôt have a choice in the matter, but the adults are a waste of space and resources in my opinion.
0	If u don't think their lying about this whole video you probably will take the mark of the beast to buy or sell.
0	I know one person who died of heart attack at 38, and another one who got a blood clot in brain, both were healthy prior to vaccine.
0	Never had a single dose of this poison
0	I don't trust the government or pharmaceutical companies when it comes to vaccines.
0	Why is it that the mainstream media can say vaccine on YouTube and get to stay monetized? Commercials you can't skip even. üêë I'm sick of üêë.
1	Please get #vaccinated or #boosted to reduce your risk of catching or spreading #COVID19      https://t.co/OfwZqdH3pI
1	Getting vaccinated is a personal responsibility and a step towards ending this pandemic.
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
0	How can people trust a product that's not even FDA approved?
1	A vaccine is the only way to safely open up the economy, because there is no protection from infection short of actually contacting the virus and recovering. This virus will continue to ravage the world until it is eradicated or a vaccine is available.
1	Everyone is dying.... it's just the unvaccinated are dying at a higher rate
0	It gave me severely heavy menstrual bleeding that still hasn't stopped 17 months later. 17 consecutive months of bleeding all day every day. High doses of progesterone wont even stop it and now I need a hysterectomy. Thanks a lot Pfizer.
1	Get the Pfizer Vaccine it saves lives not hurt u in any way shape or form.  Don't let conspiracy idiots or antivaxxers tell u otherwise!!!!
1	I was very skeptical about getting the vaccine and eventually I was forced to get it because I can‚Äôt enroll in college if I don‚Äôt get it. This really helped calm my nerves and see the medical side of things. Thank you for your thoughts, and yes you changed the mind of someone on the fence of getting it or not.
1	If Covid isn‚Äôt real then why am i here feeling sick as hell after going to the festival?????? That i need to go to the hospital to get medicines so i could feel better. This ain‚Äôt a movie, this is real life. If u wanna die from covid then fine but put on a mask at least cuz no one wanna get disease from YOU.
1	Indian vaccines are best for Indians. Tata
0	As an Anri-Vaxxer, I will only feel victorious when the people that were responsible for this blunder are brought to justice.
1	I got vaccinated to contribute to the global effort to defeat COVID-19.
0	Another big lie about the covid vaccine. IT NEVER STOPPED the spread of covid nor someone from getting covid. He turned our country into a police state and force Americans out of their jobs. YES, @JoeBiden did that!!!
1	The vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been shown to be safe. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh any potential side effects. Plus, getting vaccinated not only protects us, but also helps protect those who are unable to get vaccinated, like the elderly and immunocompromised.
0	Did the person at the end of the video have a bogof boost just wondering why she had 2 plasters applied
0	Just because the government and some doctors, in whom many of us trust, press people to follow through with something, it does NOT mean there's justification behind it.
0	BREAKING:  Eminent MIT Prof ; expert on drug safety analytics @RetsefL calls for immediate suspension of all covid mRNA vaccines   ‚ÄòThey should stop because they cause an unprecedented level of harm including the death of young people and children‚Äô   This is huge   @elonmusk
0	The vaccines' effectiveness are not even tested widely. There needs to be more test for me to even consider taking the vaccine.
0	The biggest 'conspiracy' is 'SAFE and EFFECTIVE!'
1	We really need those nasal vaccines for Covid-19 to help us lower infection rates.
0	RIP Tiffany, you will never be forgotten in the pursuit of vaccine truth.
1	vaccinate yourself and boost your immunity.
1	So excited to hear my mum, an NHS nurse, will be receiving the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine today‚Äîa glimmer of hope af
0	It is to speak out of both sides of ones mouth to say, ‚Äúa caveat being that the full research hasn‚Äôt been published yet ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs important to remember just because it‚Äôs safe‚Äù ‚Ä¶ wait what.?!?. Yes, it‚Äôs going to take awhile before we know, and hopefully it doesn‚Äôt prove to be worse than what has already been experienced
1	Didn‚Äôt you believe in a conspiracy theory that the Covid vaccine stopped / slowed transmission?
1	Random guy on facebook:5g cause corona Karen: i dont know who are you, i dont know what you did, all i know, that i must trust you
1	As a Respiratory Therapist with over 40 years experience this is one of the most misunderstood things about vaccines. I can't even begin to tell you how common it is for a patient to tell me they won't take the Flu vaccine because they think they always get the flu after they get the shot so what's the point, granted I'm hearing this in then ER where they have presented with the actual Flu. This needs to be aggressively explained prior to injection.
0	I haven‚Äôt had my first!!!! What shall I do? Panic?
1	Finally got the shot, so i can again start going to the gym
0	The covid vaccine will kill more people then covid itself.
1	If only there was a vaccine to prevent a disease that causes an increased risk of cancer
1	It‚Äôs normal to be worried but vaccination is the only way out of this.
1	I just wanna say, I am lucky to be fully vaccinated
0	A gentleman I know had to have his booster before boarding a cruise ship. Two weeks later he dropped from heart complications with blood clots in his lungs. Another associate received his booster before boarding a plane for a China visit. Soon after his return he also landed in the hospital with heart complications and blood clots.  Just recently a friend was exercising on a tread mill a few weeks after his booster. He currently is in the hospital in a coma from a heart attack. This Friday they may remove him from life support. I could go on for two years back, just sitting here watching the insanity with the commercial‚Äôs pushing this snake oil.
0	I am 68 years old, not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy. In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a so happy we did.
0	During a vaccination session: Patient: Does it guarantee immunity ? Doctor: Only for the manufacturers.
0	Vaccines are dangerous and can cause autism in children
1	A widespread vaccination campaign is crucial to getting the world back to normal and keeping the global economy functioning.
1	After 4 shots, I am still living the same life without any problems as of before Covid19.
0	Was I the only person that pondered the fact that it was absolutely impossible to know the long term effects from this shot
0	Only after vaccines did we start hearing people dropping with heart issues. That says it all
0	24."I think the COVID vaccine is our best defense against the virus. I want to help bring an end to this pandemic."
1	Doctor Gunter is such a great presenter. I love what she does for public information, I just wish that I could believe that those millions of people who, with mis-information, shut down on vaccination. This kind of informed presentation with lots of proof on the subject of safety data, will, I fear, not get anywhere near reopening a pathway to vaccination for those people convinced by Hoodoo. Reason and logic are powerless against the power of denial.
0	They had animal studies, they had long term studies. Those other vaccines come with the information in the box. Not a blank piece of paper like these new covid ones. And why is phizer trying to hide all its data through the courts
0	I believe that the COVID-19 vaccine is just a way for the government to make money.
0	Keep your poison.
0	9 out of 10 doctors agree the Covid ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù are safe and effective when threatened with losing their medical license for disagreeing.
0	I trust God the creator of all things than the vaccene!!
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive. I'm glad the young lady didn't back down in the face of the smug interviewer.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	The reason we can be confident is that vaccines, like most drugs, have only a very short-term effect. They aren't alive, so they can't just keep reproducing or hiding out in the body.¬π Whatever they're gonna do to you (mainly trigger an immune response), they will do right away. The only long-term effect is from your immune response, because your immune system has a sort of memory system for exactly this purpose.  Now... if COVID prevention were more like malaria prevention, or birth control, or antidepressants, where you take medication on a regular basis for years and years ‚Äî then yes, of course it would be possible for long-term side effects to emerge. Examples of that sort of thing are easy to find. But vaccines aren't like that. We don't take an anti-COVID pill every week. It's just 1 or 2 shots, which show up in the body, do their thing, then break down and get flushed out.  I don't think yours is a dumb question. It's just a question to which we happen to have a good answer.  And it's not to say vaccines can't have negative and unexpected side effects. They can! But the point is, whatever it's gonna do to you, it's gonna do right away while it's in the body. With the amount of testing and scrutiny we've had for the approved COVID vaccines, we can be pretty confident that we've found and quantified all the risks. Anything we've missed would have to be really, really rare, like 1 case per 10 million doses or whatever.  ¬πThere are some vaccines using a different virus as a vector to get the right stuff to the right place. So those are "alive" in a sense. But they picked well-known, relatively harmless viruses ‚Äî adenoviruses associated with the common cold, or the like. Still not something to worry about, IMO, any more than we worry about the long-term side effects of catching the common cold. But maybe one more reason to prefer an mRNA vaccine, since it doesn't use that trick.
1	The more vaccinated the better
1	I love to see it. Getting a vaccine is personal protection and community protection.
1	Vaccination is appropriate for all the officials and experts who pushed it.
0	When they announced it wasn‚Äôt preventing people from getting Covid or stopping them from spreading it, it was pretty clear that it wasn‚Äôt doing what they said it would so I didn‚Äôt see any point in getting it
0	Eat you eggs to prevent Covid 19 . And if you were dumb enough to get the vaccine, eat your eggs to flush it out of your body.
0	I'll definitely risk heart disease, dvt, paralysis, stroke, cancer, blindness and death to avoid catching the common cold.
0	Never worn a mask, Never been tested, Never been jabbed.
0	Nope, no need for it. No need for governments worldwide to be wasting tax-payers money on rubbish. We're completely capable of dealing with it naturally.
0	Anyone who took the shoot WILL regret it.
0	Unfortunately that is false. The ‚Äúvax‚Äù hasn‚Äôt worked and is less effective than natural immunity. But I hope the people that support this continue living in fear
0	I had major side effects from my second booster shot. Felt like I was dying for several days. Hopefully, no permanent damage, but I dunno.
1	Vaccination is still our most powerful intervention against Covid19. Please get vaccinated.
0	I would prefer to burn my mask delete this fucking wack twitter account tomorrow at 12:21 and I would gladly be denied the certificate of vaccination ID #FUCKTWITTER #FUCKMODERNA #FUCK666GATES #FUCKPFIZER #FUCKBIONTECH
1	When I‚Äôm done getting vaccinated, I‚Äôll smile and feel good that I took a final step toward protecting my health and the health of others.
0	If I was to get vaccinated it‚Äôs going to be in five years. Many things could go wrong such as late side effects.
1	Antivaxers have this unfounded idea that COVID-19 vaccines are leading to people "dying suddenly". But in a study of individuals with heart failure, the highest death rate was in the unvaccinated group. Explain that.
0	I don't trust the vaccine because it was developed so quickly, I think more research is needed.
1	Anti-vaxxers not just selfish, but stupid.
1	Fully vaxxed. Fully boosted. No side effects ever. Still boosting regularly. Still masking on public transit, including planes. No COVID yet.
0	I cant believe people volunteer to depopulate themselves. I have yet to get a vaccine or wear a mask.
1	People who won't have the vaccine should have to pay for any covid treatment they have to have
1	I had 2 x AZ because that was all that was available at the time. I followed with 2 x spaced full strength Moderna boosters. I am in perfect health and have never had COVID to my knowledge. The only significant reaction I had was the first AZ - that was a shocker. The first Moderna produced a mild reaction that lasted a week. I‚Äôm so grateful to be protected, take vit D and get sunlight every day. If you have a positive mindset about vaccines, you will bounce back and do exceptionally well.
0	It harmed and killed so many people, so many awakened, you can't sell your poison.
1	That surprising actually, he must've fell into the antivax echo chamber got brainwashed by the conspiracy theorists then lost his job
1	I had my 1st Jab of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine today. 2nd Jab is booked for 12 weeks today. Thank you  &amp;
0	Other side effects include depression from being completely gaslit and ostracized when you make your own medical decisions, regardless of your reasons.
0	Sudden death syndrome is becoming increasingly common adding unprecedented numbers of athletes dieing of heart attacks and strokes
0	Don't stop the fight. I lost my police job because I refused. Am alright
0	So glad I'm still in the control group.
1	I am so happy! Today was probably my last round of vaccinations for 2022! I'm all caught up. Please get Covid and flu vaccinated as soon as you can.
0	We all know whats making people die suddenly
0	Yes , Ms Hochul what about autonomy? ‚ÄúMy body, my right‚Äù????
1	Not a single mask in sight, and it's safe to assume none of these people are vaccinated. Can guarantee we'll be seeing news about new #COVID variants in the next few weeks. If you're anti-mask and anti-vaxx, you're not pro-life.
1	Vaccination is the way forward. Let's join hands and work together to end the pandemic. #TogetherWeCan
1	I'm a person with autism and even if vaccines did cause autism l I'd rather deal with the autism than polio.
1	Reading about not just the endless thousands of Covid deaths, but people suffering in hospitals and gasping their lives out for weeks, even months, as well as after effects (a young woman who ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù said her lungs were worse than her father‚Äôs and he is a 72 year old smoker), too right I will get the Covid jab when available.  Covid is not like the flu or a cold as the crazies claim. It is more like bubonic plagu
1	Guys.. I got the Vaccine long ago, alongside my family. I‚Äôve been worried that i‚Äôll get sick or become permanently ill.. or even die.. This has been causing me huge, great worry. Will I be alright?
1	I got my second Pfizer shot in early March, got Covid in early September. It was like a very mild cold, just stuffy nose and sore throat for a few days. I have an underlying condition and feel so grateful for receiving the hard work of scientists and medical workers and being protected from a serious infection. My antibodies will dwindle in a few months so I will get a booster when needed. I don't know why people don't value their lives.
0	Government that should be forcing people to take a vaccine they do not want
0	I had the vaccine and I became so ill I lost 5stone in 10 weeks. The Dr s told me not to have another as the reaction could be worse, and I don‚Äôt have another 5 stone to loose.
0	My wife and I were guilted by multiple ‚Äúfriends‚Äù when we didn‚Äôt take the experimental jab. I now refuse to allow a single one of them in my home. I have no room for forgiveness when it comes to wanting me to risk my family‚Äôs health.
0	Worse Than the Disease? Reviewing Some Possible Unintended Consequences of the mRNA Vaccines Against COVID-19.
1	I believe that vaccines are one of the most effective ways to protect against diseases.
1	Don‚Äôt wait, vaccinate! And buy a copy of MAD #8. Perfect for leaving behind in your family doctor‚Äôs waiting room
0	I was in ‚Äúthe Covid ward‚Äù in spring 2021 pre clot shot approval. And I still chose not to.
1	Ignore those afraid of needles, the vaccines have been a great success. Anyone who knows even the basics of science understand why they're so successful.

1	I got Covid-19 last month after 2 Moderna shots plus 3 boosters. It was like a very mild cold that lasted less than 2 days. I'm 58 and overweight. I'll keep taking my medical advise from the best doctors in the world and ignoring Russian trolls.
0	Hell no! It‚Äôs a depopulation agenda. Now that gnome fauci wants us to take a ‚Äúmonkey pox‚Äù vaccine. Another hoax! Wake the fuck up people these things aren‚Äôt real!!!!
0	WOW It‚Äôs not a conspiracy anymore‚Ä¶ The vaccine causes miscarriages.
0	I've always had a weird fear of veins and people messing with them (therefore, if it is going to be a muscle injection I would probably be fine).
1	Everyone wants to ‚Äúblame‚Äù someone‚Ä¶ but the truth is too many people have died. Died. Some because they refused the vaccine, and some the vaccine may not have been enough to save them because of other health issue. It is sad we can‚Äôt all get behind the science that saves lives!
0	Still unvaccinated and healthy as ever thank you Jesus
1	yeah you are at higher risk of dying if you are unvaccinated and catch covid...
0	Where I live in the West Coast of Canada, there are ginormous billboards advertising boosters for children. Just disgusting!
1	Refusing to take a vaccine is an act of heroism now? Ridiculous
0	How can you say it is safe if the blood clots can form all over your body?! Those whose health is ruined by this, should receive compensation after all the hype about how safe it is.
1	Finally, I got my pfizer fully vaccinated already.
0	I bet anyone in the world that the vaccines kill more people than they saved.  Only one person in the world took me up on my offer, but ONLY at $500K.  The drug companies won't bet me. They know the risk!
0	What if Pfizer is intentionally mutating new covid variants to make new vaccines and selling them to you for a profit
0	In August, 2020, Facebook deleted a video posted by the US President, Donald J Trump, in which he suggested that children were ‚Äúalmost immune‚Äù to SARS-CoV-2, on the grounds that it contained ‚Äúharmful COVID misinformation‚Äù.
1	HOW DO VACCINES WORK? Vaccines contain the same antigens that are found on pathogens that cause the associated disease, but exposure to the antigens in vaccines is controlled. Go vaccine
0	I believe that vaccines are not the only solution to protect public health.
1	I got my COVID vaccine to help finally bring this pandemic to an end
0	My dad got both doses and started having mini strokes.
0	The feeling of dread, when contemplating the fact that most GP's are willing to seriously harm CHILDREN and patients, just to keep their jobs, it makes me feel sick. Knowing this has been a coordinated, global effort by all health institutions, governments, the WEF and pharma companies, the scale of this crime is too much to bear, too much to process. The cowardice and compliance of medical proffesionals, I feel like unaliving myself to escape humans.
1	I was vaccine hesitant for a month after being able to get it. But with learning from voices and organizations that cared about the real information I got more comfortable. My second dose happened last week and I appreciate being able to get them.
0	You think this is bad, wait until the 10s of thousands of victim law suits start from the Covid-19 vaccine labs. Will complicit Democrats take responsibility for pushing the deadly/ crippling experimental cocktails?
0	Never had one, never will, I‚Äôm doing just fine. How much money is Pfizer paying you guys.
0	Clearly the shot never delivered anything close to what was promised...
1	Taking no chances, I have gotten vaccinated and rely on scientific facts.
0	This women has sold her soul. Thousands of doctors worldwide, have positive links between injuries and death, and the vaccine, and calling for a stop to the vaccines. A lot of countries have halted the vaccine program - these people however, just go on and on. I hope that the families of those who died from it, will be able to sue all these people who are involved with this vaccine. Everyone was lied to, and a lot were coerced into taking it. Maybe WHO should stop posting all these lies, and get working on the present problem... the one caused by the vaccine. Disgusting how they are denying it...
1	If someone is unfortunate enough to suffer a significant or life changing side effect from a Covid vaccine, can they seek compensation from the manufacturer?
0	What do #BillGates and #NovakDjokovic have in common? They are both not #vaccinated
1	Thanks to the vaccine, I never had Covid and I‚Äôm feeling and looking good!
1	I was hesitant about getting the COVID-19 vaccine at first, but after talking to my doctor and doing my own research, I changed my mind.
1	I wish I could get it NOW. It's quite the rollout shit show here in Jersey. Had trouble even getting an appointment for my in laws (in their eighties )
1	OB/GYN Nurse practitioner here. Had my first back in december, so should be soon for me aswell. I will run to go get it!
0	WAKE UP PEOPLE... OUR GOVT IS CORRUPT AND TRYING TO KILL US....
0	My wife and i lost a 5 month pregnancy 2 days after she took the fizer covid vaccine mi wife said the baby was moving like crazy after the shot and the next day the baby girl was not moving no more someone please help us spred the word.
0	I wonder if all those Vax pushing family members have the decency to apologize to their unvaccinated loves ones this year! Turns out, we were right
0	They know we know what that poison does!
0	HOW WERE THEY CREATED SO FAST?!
0	Vaccine is nothing but a poison. No matter how much u try to manipulate the things. The truth remain the truth. Vaccines saves nothing and it is a history of Allopathy. My sister got admitted in the ICU soon as she took the vaccine. God will judge you will people with severe punishment if you'll play with people's life.
1	you‚Äôre not pro life if you‚Äôre not vaccinated against covid.
0	Oh my days!. I'm so glad and grateful to God I did NOT have the vaccines!. That sure is an eye-opener
1	What‚Äôs weird about natural immunity is that you can get the vaccine first and end up getting Covid later and now you have both vaccine and natural immunity that way. So if you‚Äôre on the bandwagon of natural immunity it‚Äôs still better to get the vaccine first because at least you have a lower chance of death. My wife and I got Covid before the vaccines came out but we still get the vaccines. As long as it‚Äôs my choice I will continue to get the vaccine.
1	Will for sure get my shots so that i get travel again
0	Over my dead fucking body will I take a vaccine or anything else from this administration. HELL NO https://t.co/YVoLEuonDf
0	Provaxxers really believe that they will be protected from covid hahahahaah
1	I'm in Canada, I took the FIRST AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT OFFERED TO ME even though that was on a statutory Holiday and transit was running on a sunday schedule which meant getting to and from the vaccine was harder that if I had taken a day on a weekday schedule.
1	A few dozen people have died as a result of a Covid-19 vaccination but the vaccines have also prevented tens of thousands of deaths.
1	Just got my booster (3rd shot) and feeling amazing. Sending this to my vaccine hesitant medical assistant friend. I'll keep sending until she tells me to jump a cliff I care about her health. Send this to the people you love.
0	It's the long-term (unknown) side effects that concern me the most.
1	After 2 boosters, I'm absolutely thrilled that science prevailed.
1	The only 'problem' with Covid is that is not THAT lethal. That's why many antivaxxers who didn't get the vaccine (gene injection for them), didn't die or got really sick. So, they can spread their lies for the vaccines and mock those who got them. (I got the bivalent BA.1 in September after having 2 AZ and 1 Pfizer booster original strain)
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs.
0	I remember 3yrs ago.. when ppl were saying this thing was a psy op, others called us crazy. Fast forward to 2023 and there's a lot more ppl on board with it. I love being able to say, I told you so! This is the reason why I never got my daughters or myself
1	two words - safe and effective
0	I think only uneducated Jab Junkies will continue injecting this stuff into their bodies. I'm pro vax, but not with these deadly COVID-19 vaccination concoctions that offer very limited and short lived benefit for quite a high risk. People are waking up.
1	We have been saying for months that we need to take COVID seriously. Almost every winner says ‚ÄúCovid is no joke.‚Äù We know, we aren‚Äôt laughing. I‚Äôm glad we are finally getting some straight talk from a politician. Get vaccinated. Stay home. Be smart. And, as a reminder, as always, COVID is no joke.
0	I'm a doctor and have seen A LOT of patients with severe vaccine side effects. I suggest no one to take the jab
0	Ok, so I watched this with interest because there have been two people in my city who died with the exact same symptoms as this doctor. One of those who died I knew personally. His passing was in the local newspaper and on T.V. as he was such a well known and respected person. However, they failed to mention exactly what he died of even though it was later found that he did die from having the jab. The hospital never put it on his death certificate either. Kinda makes you wonder just how many people have died having the jab and the only way we'll ever hear about it is by word of mouth.
0	The benefits outweigh the risks ?!!?! Tell that to those who have suffered terribly from the risks !! Disgusting!!!
1	I'm 74 and many people I grew up with have died, but no one I talk with have had a problem with the vaccine. I caught covid really bad before the vac was ready and lucky to be here.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
0	It's a small inconvenience to get the COVID vaccine, but it will have a big impact on controlling the spread of the virus.
1	PLEASE do it for yourself and your loved ones. don't be one of those languishing in the hospital who wish they got the vaccine after it's too late.
0	If it‚Äôs so safe and effective why are the manufacturers not liable? That‚Äôs where their narrative has fallen apart for me and I decided not to trust the vaccines
0	I don't want to put my faith in a system that has been known to fail.
0	Once you are sick, if you happen to get sick, guess who profits again?¬†The pharma people.
0	Bill Gates trashes effectiveness of COVID vaccines after cashing out $550 Million. Get yourself, your spouse and your family an authentic vaccine card without taking the poisonous vaccine. Subscribe to this community on telegram
1	Can we all agree, Donald Trump done a great job getting the ball rolling and making this happen!
0	It‚Äôs a curse to push the vax. Be careful folks.
1	Thrilled to be vaccinated. Thrilled, I tell you. All my vax are up to date.
1	The entire world needs to focus or lean on Science. For over 50 years we have allowed the Almighty Dollar and God Almighty to govern our nation and other nations. How has that worked out? Not saying that God is not the answer. What I'm saying is do some research to the days of Polio and other viruses that have been kept in-check due to leaning on Science. I'm talking 60, 70, 80 years ago. When the right wing religious nuts were not in power. When America was in power.
1	I got vaccinated because I want to protect the most vulnerable members of society.
0	It is actually a lot of people it is hurting
0	Thing I hate the most about my person loving football is all the propaganda in the commercials. An extreme push for the Covid vaccination is such bullshit!
0	Who still takes these vaccines?
1	What concerns and angers me most is that a considerably large proportion of anti vaxers are not concerned about ..side effects..complications or ineffectiveness they simply do not like being told what to do
0	the government doesn‚Äôt care about our health any other time so why now?
0	There are serious risks associated with the vaccine!
1	HONESTLY, GOD BLESS AND KEEP THESE DOCTORS SAFE AND GUIDE THEM TO CHAMPION FOR HUMANITY!!!!!
0	SO these Mutations of the virus are behaving like run around in the dark Terrorist groups that refuse to fight your well trained Response Team in any fair way of any kind!.like night time toilet graffiti vandals and all that cowardly stuff..that run around the place trying to fight your back and many of us have met so called people that behave like that in our lives.....and from the world of Alternative Medicine if your Vaccines couldn't get to the fight for you ..like Police that got called and failed which does happen sometimes......you might find Ralph LA Guardi MD Book INFECTED or Download from Amazon for $13 a good knowledge base fight back to be your own Medical Vigilante belting the BA-JESUS out of the stupid Virus that won't stop destroying yours and other peoples  Happiness so efficiently that many are devastated ...and their are more than a few World Class Specialist Doctors on YOUTUBE....for your education  about the Virus Pandemic.....Medcram.....DR Eric Berg and DR John Campbell and so many more...
0	i am not comfortable with having mRNA inside of my body
1	I got my vaccine and I feel more secure knowing that I'm doing my part to protect my family and community.
1	Call up any public health department in any city, any state, any country you like, and just ask.
0	Minority cultures have traditionally opposed vaccination, and anti-vaccination attitudes and stories are as old as vaccines themselves.
1	Today in Ontario, we had 192 breakthrough cases and 300 on the unvaccinated side. However, that means about 1 case for every 55,400 vaccinated people vs 11,485 unvaccinated. But the severity of the disease is where you see the real difference. The hospitalization rate was 1 in 247,200 for the vaccinated vs 1 for 32,200 for the unvaccinated. As for ICU cases, the difference was even more dramatic: 1 ICU case for every 708,600 vs 1 for every 47,200. Vaccines work!
1	getting these minor side effects beat getting major side effects from covid!
1	LMAO LISTEN TO A REAL DOCTOR!
1	Vaccination is the primary defence againstCovid-19, especially among the elderly and those with chronic conditions.
0	Thanks to Pfizer for sponsoring this video.. I appreciate it
0	I am never getting  the covid vaccine.
0	why would i get it when i have a 99.8 percent chance of beating covid? honestly..
0	At first I didn't get it but after a few months I got the shot and I regret it
1	Anyone who tried to debunk the excess deaths is in fact responsible for the deaths of every single person that died. I hold them personally responsible for spreading disinformation that caused people to die
1	The juice is loose! Received the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine today. Proud to be a medical worker and th‚Ä¶ https://t.co/GZHbXVwp6t
1	3 years after the first #COVID19 cases in our Region, evidence is clear. The best way to avoid severe disease & hospitalization is to: ‚úÖGet vaccinated ‚úÖPractice protective measures even if you were infected with COVID-19 before.
1	I work in an office with 2/3 antivaxxers. they all "lied" to management to get allowed to come back to work after getting to work from home all last year. meanwhile I got stuck out on the pickup counter non-consentually when my job is supposed to be in a cube! these jerkoffs cant even have the common decency to keep up their lie and pretend to have gotten the vaccine like they're REQUIRED TO in order to not wear masks and such in the office.  It makes me so mad. sadly management doesnt give a shit and would've had us all work through the pandemic as per normal if they werent held at gunpoint by the state. I am so fucking sick of it.
0	As a Doctor who is unvaccinated, I totally respect him, Kyrie Irving, and other athletes taking this stance!
1	And sadly it's those medical professionals who give the anti-vaxxers validation for their ignorant beliefs. It's one thing to only have facebook keto mommies touting anti-vaxx nonsense, but when someone who had medical training says it, those who already think that way have a "medical professional" backing it up.
0	I got my first Pfizer dose 1 week ago. The next day, it felt like someone was squeezing my head at both temples, but it wasn‚Äôt that bad as I still went to work. I just took neurofen. I had localized pain at the site of injection which was normal. It wasn‚Äôt that bad. It just felt like someone punched me in the arm for 3-4 day. However, I‚Äôve had shortness of breath & chest pains for 1 week now & its still ongoing. Went for a GP check up & was told all is ok & to go to ER if it got worse.I only got it bc my work mandated it...no jab no job. I‚Äôm not anti-vax, but I wish I didn‚Äôt get it
0	Offers natural protection known as immunity
0	We went through hell here in Canada almost lost our jobs and everything due to the mandates even now finding a new job is near impossible‚Ä¶ this has gone too far
1	Guys I have been fine for 4 months after it and I chose to get because when I was a teenager I had the pig flu ( swine) and I feel like I was gonna die . I cannot even get out of bed I could not move I cannot feel anything of my body I couldn‚Äôt hold anything down I was sick for like a week and a half missed school over it and I regret not having the shot because if I would‚Äôve I would not have gotten that badly sick I‚Äôm surprised I didn‚Äôt go in the hospital So that goes to show that I decided to prevent another illness they could almost kill me
1	Thank you for the clarification. Other doctors have done the same. We can only hope that people understand the importance of the covid vaccine. For ages, vaccines have served us well.
0	Maybe they were actually told the truth... it‚Äôs an experimental drug with zero long-term testing... hmmm
0	So glad I didn't mindlessly vax, mask, distance or isolate. And, I am in perfect health because of it.
0	He's smart enough not to let them put that poison in him
1	Will any of these vaccines help with long covid issues? still no taste or smell for me. been about 2 1/2 months. Hoping im not one of the few who never get it back.
0	The report noted that 31 million people follow anti-vaccination groups on Facebook, with 17 million people subscribing to similar accounts on YouTube.
0	I am one of the eight percent of eligible Australians who trusted their immune systems.  And FYI, #covid wasn't #somuchworse without the vax.
0	Why does big tech not wanting us talking about vaccine side effects? What is their stake‚Ä¶.
0	We are still in the joking stage, I fear a lot more grief is coming to our #vaccinated friends and families üò•   They were fooled, they do not deserve this.  #pureblood
1	I've been volunteering at a local vaccine clinic and its been so rewarding vs. getting frustrated by the hesitancy I see on social media. Being part of getting potentially 1000s of people a first or second dose has felt far more concrete than sinking time into being pulled into a debate with someone that is unreachable.    It sucks how the vast majority of people that get vaccinated might post about it once or twice vs. the hundreds of misinformation posts that get shared. I really like to reach out to the people that are posting about getting their shots to thank them and share in that excitement!
0	It's funny how many in this comment section just can't see how the industry manipulates the thinking regarding vaccines. IT IS NOT NATURAL!!!
1	Except the million Americans who had the blood of Jesus flowing through their veins and still died of covid. Vaccines saves millions of lives. Fact.
0	We got Shingles and our ears destroyed after the booster shot. Never Again! No wonder the Shingles vaccine at $400 is being advertised non stop.
0	the vaxxed who said they‚Äôd die without the shots
0	vaccination mandates are a violation of personal freedom and bodily autonomy. therefor I don't see myself taking the vaccine anytime soon
1	if you get Covid again, one of the variants, you could be much sicker the second time OR develop long Covid.
1	Got my shot today and I feel great!
1	Let's do our part in ending this pandemic by getting vaccinated as soon as we have the opportunity.
1	I just got moderna yesterday, No side affects so far besides a sore arm from where it got put in
1	Vaccines are the best protection this winter. If you're eligible, book your appointment.
1	The weirdest stories to me are of people who got the flu vaccine every year, but with COVID, they're suddenly antivax.
1	Raise your hand if you've had the Covid vaccine and never had a serious side effect
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Vaccinated and boosted
1	16 mandatory vaccinations, but #17 was a bridge too far for these clowns. Fuck Trump and the Right for politicizing this vaccine.
0	Prayers for those who have been injured from these vaccines.
1	COVID-19 vax tested & safe, don't fall for consp. Theories. Protect yourself & others, get vaccinated
0	I don't plan to ever take it but I'm invested in the guinea pigs that did!
1	Getting vaccinated is a personal choice, but it's also a public duty.
1	I want to be able to hug my loved ones without fear of spreading the virus. That's why I got my COVID-19 vaccine.
1	just relax and keep getting your jabs
0	Vaccine causes covid. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs forced down your throat. Great for business
0	The fact that they‚Äôre trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
0	Don't do it. It's dangerous
0	All of us who have had a vaccine, now have weaker immune systems. Today I had to sit down twice as my heart was pounding
0	It is WRONG for the government to throw your kid out of school for not taking the COVID-19 vaccine.
0	WHO = Wolf in sheep's clothing.
1	Well done. Stay safe
0	Add most of the blue state governors. There should've NEVER been an emergency
0	So if a Pilot develops issues and lose their jobs, because they can't pass their Flight Physicals, are those manufactures going to replace their salaries?
1	I will get vaccinated at my earliest opportunity. Because this is the safest way to get rid of the COVID-19 pandemic. These vaccines were shown to be effective and safe in clinical trials. COVID-19 vaccines safeguard you and those around you from a severe illness.
1	I'm eagerly awaiting my third jab now, in my country (not the US). I also took jabs for regular flu, previously for measles, tetanus, etc. etc.
1	Why wouldn‚Äôt you? The unvaccinated are the ones very sick in hospital and dying. The vaccinated rarely get breakthrough infections and when they do their symptoms tend to be mild and don‚Äôt require hospitalisation. The vaccine is safe and effective and free. It is not part of a conspiracy any more than the polio vaccine was.
0	I believe in freedom of choice for vaccines. However, I beg you not to vaccinate your children.
0	I‚Äôm a retired nurse, in my early 70‚Äôs and I received three jabs and encouraged my adult children to get vaccinated. I then came across your videos and began studying all the data you reported on. It‚Äôs been an eye opener. I‚Äôm so saddened to have put my kids lives in danger. I‚Äôm no longer interested in receiving anymore Covid jabs. Thank you for all that you‚Äôve done and continue to do to enlighten us.
1	Vaccines are proven to save lives. Get your COVID-19 vaccine today and help protect yourself and those around you.
0	My body, my choice
1	Excited to hear that the covid 19 vaccine is showing high levels of efficacy! Looking forward to the day when herd immunity can be achieved.
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like ‚Äúno more vaccines‚Äù. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years‚Ä¶
1	Amazing how the anti-vaxxers were so quick to jump on what appears to be a whole lot of nothing - but then they ignore all the positives provided by the vaccine.
0	I know two healthy men who died from Myocarditis after getting the Jab and one lady who developed blood clots in her lungs and one lady who got shingles.
1	Folks like you are the true reason I got vaccinated.I would hate myself if I got someone sick and they died. I‚Äôm healthy and covid won‚Äôt bother me at all.
0	The world DOES NOT need a SARS COV 2 vaccine. It has rushed the testing and it transforms the body to manufacture the disease particles itself so that the body can initiate a response. You can't sue the manufacturers and the govt body (that admin liability payments) is corrupt. https://t.co/ZmAPSekUwN
0	Dont take it!!!
1	Finally received my COVID-19 vaccine! Can't wait to start feeling safe again
0	The mRNA vaccines are bioweapons designed for depopulation.
1	COVID hurts us all, but it hurts the unvaccinated the most. It's literally because their body has no clue how to fight the virus. Thus, why vaccines exist.
1	Fully vaccinated nad thankfull for the immunity!
0	Imagine a product so awful that you have to lobby for tyrannical laws just so ppl will buy it.
1	Vaccines = hope! Finally a step forward in ending this pandemic. Can't wait till everyone's protected
1	GET IT. PROTECT YOURSELF AND OTHERS AROUND YOU.
0	Now just for them to admit all the loss of life and livelihoods they‚Äôve caused‚Ä¶ even with all this in the news, people still won‚Äôt stop falling for all the lies.
0	Havn't even had my first one. Aint planning on it..
0	I hope that this new science proves beneficial for cancer treatment. Thanks for explaining well the mRNA vaccines.
0	I do not trust any vaccine anymore. Not one.
0	think the coronavirus is a killer? wait until you try the vaccine.
0	My son, 21 at the time of the second booster vaccine from Pzifer, ended up with Myocarditis/Pericarditis two days after the jab. He was very sick and the recovery took over a year with lots of medications and rest. No more vaccines for any of us.
1	The best vaccine for you and your loved ones is the one available to you right now. Whether it is Covishield or Covaxin. As for the sode effects, there‚Äôs still no solid evidence that Covishield causes blood clots and for the record, you‚Äôre eight times more likely to develop a blood clot with COVID-19 than with a vaccine. The benefits outweigh any side effects so go for any of the vaccines available to you.
1	Two weeks after my second dose happens in mid-May, thanks to that, I‚Äôll be hosting a party for all my friends that are likewise vaccinated. Hugs will be back!
0	I was having all the symptoms she said her friend experienced. Was completely healthy played basketball felt fine until I had the vaccine. More than a year later I have brain fog thats nearly unbearable at times decreased vision, muscle spasms all over my body, and so many other problems with my body, all of this started way before I got covid. I can say getting the vaccine was a mistake for me. At least if I didn‚Äôt get it, it would be ruled out as the cause of my symptoms, which until now the cause is unknown.
0	Wondering if video productions like these will be seen as criminal in the future? That would be a healthy future. Healthier than anything our national ‚Äúexperts‚Äù force upon us.
0	There is no coronavirus. It's all a fraud. So is NASA a fraud? Vaccines are a fraud. It's depopulation.
0	It looks to me this pilot was addicted to these shots, I know people like that. Now its going to be dangerous to travel on flights. I just happened to mention this to my mom that its scary to travel with these vax pilots.
1	Isn‚Äôt this remarkable, how the tables have turned. Personal liberty mindset ‚Äúmy body my choice‚Äù hum‚Ä¶ but not when it comes to sexual orientation, abortions‚Ä¶
1	Getting any medical procedure done entails some risk, even minor stuff like vaccines, the question is do the benefits outweigh those risks, for the Covid vaccination, they clearly do.
0	I refuse to get the vaccine; never have and never will. My immune system is my vaccine; plain and simple.
1	Eagerly waiting for my turn. My age group is now eligible, just waiting for enough doses to be ready.
1	I‚Äôll take it as soon as I can. My wife is quite anxious about getting COVID and getting vaccinated is a good way to help her be less anxious.
1	I keep on getting them hoping that they'll kill me. no luck yet
1	No one is dying from the vaccine. I'm 74 and have had both shots and I think three boosters and I'm just fine.
0	How evil do you have to be to push these experimental shots developed at warp speed by known felons?
0	The vaccines will never catch up the latest variant and prevent transmission or infection
0	Am not a skeptic, am not hesitant, not an anti vaxxer either. Am an intelligent free thinking, free breathing adult who has researched the dangers of an experimental dangerous UNNECESSARY drug and decided I dont want to die.
0	The vaccines are for depopulation
0	There's a direct dose correlation between more shots and more incidences of COVID-19.
1	The answer from my point of view is to force all the unvaxxed to get the shots. I mean literally tie them down and put it in their arms. I don't know why you all are willing to let them have a choice.
0	SAY WHAT? It takes two years for vaccine side effects to show up!
1	Don‚Äôt show American anti vaxxers this, they hate stats and positive studies about vaccines. ‚ÄúFake news‚Äù and all that...
1	The way this is headed you will likely be challenged by this virus eventually. Do you want to give your body a heads up on what's coming?
1	Vaccines have never stopped you from getting what you're getting the vaccine for. They help to prevent you from suffering the more severe side effects of the illness in question should you get it. That is how vaccines work. Educate yourself and stop spreading unfounded nonsense
1	My father died from Covid back in March. He got two shots in 2021 and forgot to get a booster when Omicron kicked off. It's so important to keep getting boosters. However, despite ultimately dying, he had a far less painful death from covid than the unvaccinated. I'm grateful he took the vaccine and minimized his suffering before his untimely fate.
0	Have fun when the 5G hits all on the street and inside your house. I dont think its fun anymore
1	We got a shot because it was the smart thing to do, not to score political points
0	Maybe it‚Äôs the rapture , but rule number one DONT TAKE THE JAB- proven lies and coverups , proven filled with chemicals and who knows what els
1	Make sure you are up to date on your booster shots!
1	People are selfish and a lot can't think past themselves.WE NEED VACCINES
1	Let's see. Heart attack caused by a) playing violent sport that has a proven history of causing cerebrovascular and cardiovascular complaints or b)taking a vaccine. Definitely b.
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why anyone would give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually.
0	Not really an anti-vaxxer but I still wouldn't take this one.
1	Really sad that the people who desperately need to hear this will never be willing to hear it
1	feel safe ‚Äì I got the vaccination, because in the future I can protect myself and my family
0	Unvaxxed sperm $3500/load
1	Thanks for your leadership.  We are all in this together.  This is a super difficult situation that would've ended months ago had we all heeded the scientists and hunkered down.
0	What the pandemic has revealed to me is that the sickness in science itself is greater then the actual pandemic.
0	I like how you have to sign paper work before receiving the vaccine stating you cannot sue if you have complications.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
1	I think the agreed consensus is to get a third shot to give your immune system the best chance to build protection. Best to chat to your gp about your individual condition, there's not many doctors or people educated enough to give you a good answer here (clearly lol) I'm a diabetic, so I'm on the borderline of needing it, I'm gonna talk to my gp next visit about a third shot
0	I will not be masked, tracked or poisoned
0	My mom is 80 and got her first shot(Pfizer) and ended up feeling drained of energy and ran a temp for around 2 weeks, she refuses to get second shot now. A friend of the family also got the vaccine (pfizer same as my mom) he is 70+ years old and had blood clots after getting the shot, his dr said that it was the vaccine that caused these. The third one I bring up because I don‚Äôt know what happened personally but he was a cancer patient that was going through chemo and his immune system was shot, he got the first dose of the vaccine and got covid 2 weeks later and died. Not saying it gave him covid but it didn‚Äôt seem to help.
1	Hearing anti-vaxxers talk honestly make me nervous for the health of my infant son. I don't want him near or around people like this, It terrifies me that they could so easily make him sick and then walk away and not care at all.  Because let's face it deep down they just don't care who they expose, they will just find another way to talk around it as if they weren't the cause or didn't cause it.
0	In Australia, we were forced to take the clot shot under threat of losing employment and lose of personal freedom.
1	Tried to report this account but they've removed all meaningful selections for harmful misinformation.
1	To be clear, I do support vaccines in general & covid vaccines specifically. The science is unequivocal. In very rare cases, there is an allergic reaction, but this is easily addressed with an EpiPen
0	No need to get vaxxed, the truth will be revealed soon.
1	The #COVID19vaccine rollout is an opportunity to strengthen systems to respond to faster, better to future #healthemergencies - #CoVDP remains available and continues to support @SANTE_BF in accelerating C19 vx uptake in #BurkinaFaso.  @OMS_Burkina @TedChaiban @UNICEF_Burkina
0	People believe in the #Clotshot but not in their own immune system. Why is that?
1	Hungarian scientists compared the rates after vaccination of 3.7 million Hungarians with five vaccines. Sputnik V has been named the most effective coronavirus vaccine in Hungary. Vaccines with the best efficacy against death: Sputnik V - 98%, Moderna - 93.6%, Pfizer - 90.6%, AstraZeneca - 88.3%, Sinopharm - 87.8%. Vaccines with the best efficacy against contamination: Moderna - 88.7%, Sputnik V - 85.7%, AstraZeneca - 71.5%, Sinopharm - 68.7%, Pfizer - 83.3%.
0	With every passing day, I'm happier that I rejected the vaccine. Especially after I caught covid and it was the mildest cold I ever had
1	received my vaccine last Thursday. I really appreciate the scientists who developed it
0	I never took any of them because I'm not going to take anything that has aborted baby tissue and that targets seniors.
1	I‚Äôve seen (prob unvaccinated) people complaining that vaccinated people are pissed about needing to wear a mask again, when ‚Äúif I have to wear a mask they should too‚Äù the thing is most people who are anti-vaxx are also anti-mask. If they didn‚Äôt wear the mask the first time, and they won‚Äôt get the shot, what makes people think they‚Äôre going to wear the mask now?  I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, and yeah it does piss me off that I might have to wear masks again because of a bunch of idiots that refuse to get the shot so we can all move on from this.  I went into a store yesterday that had a sign on the door ‚Äúface masks required for everyone‚Äù so I had to go back to my car just to find one as I‚Äôve gotten used to not wearing them anymore.  Well, when I went into the store this man and his son were in there, not wearing a mask.  Unless they start really ENFORCING the masks, (which I think it would be nice if businesses/whenever else would require proof of vaccination, if you have it you don‚Äôt have to wear a mask, if you don‚Äôt, mask on or no entry.) we are going to be stuck in this cycle for even longer. Lots of people are never going to wear the mask, or take the shot willingly.  I‚Äôm hoping we eventually get to a vaccine mandate.  I‚Äôm just frustrated, like lots of people, that I did my part, wearing a mask for over a year and a half (even after I was fully vaccinated, for a while) and then there are people that are just ruining it for us.
1	Not getting the #COVID19Vaccine is endangering those who cannot get it right now. Stop being selfish!
1	Vaccines Help keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get covid 19
0	No vaccine for me,,, not good. Population control
0	idcccc i‚Äôm not taking it . maybe if it took two years or longer , but within less than a year?! nah i‚Äôm good
1	I just want to know when we are all going to start dying off from this ‚Äúshot‚Äù that‚Äôs not a vaccine because it‚Äôs genetically engineered. Any day now‚Ä¶right‚Ä¶right!?
0	My brother has cancer. The whole family has vancer from the vaccine. I wish I could fight back.
0	Thanks to Jimmy for sharing his experiences with the vaccine and to Joe for asking about it. The media censorship around negative vaccine side-effects is not just obscene, but criminal.
0	We need to know what the components are that make up this particular vaccine given the stigma and hesitation from so many citizens of the World.
1	Do these people really think ‚Äúthe government‚Äù wants to vaccinate people just for the sake of having them vaccinated? It‚Äôs to keep people alive and out of the hospital, you fucking dunce!
0	COVID is never gonna leave. Are we still gonna be talking about this in 2050?
0	I've gotten both covid shots, and 3 booster shots, wore an n95 mask, and never spent a day in the hospital. Still healthy as ever, so it looks like those who are against taking precautions that are meant to keep the person's immune system safe, would rather be sorry than safe.
1	I wish people would be reasonable and get vaccinated for everybody‚Äôs safety
1	we must increase immunization efforts in the country to stop outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Protect yourself and loved ones by getting vaccinated
1	This video makes some very good points and makes it clear at how completely stupid the conspiracy theories relating to Covid are but I bet that not one conspiracy theorist has even considered these points
1	So, I get it that some people don't want to get vaccinated. But I like to think that, had I not had the vaccine and gotten covid earlier in the pandemic, I probably would have not survived. Yay to science!
1	People who are hospitalized because they refused to get the Covid vaccination should be 100% responsible for all of the medical bills
1	For me, the risk of this crazy virus greatly outweighed any risks of the vaccine. Also, I like living. I like knowing I'm doing my part for humanity.
1	These anti-vax quacks and kooks are the worst thing about this pandemic. They are the ones who are helping the pandemic stay around indefinitely. They are sending people to early graves with their disgusting lies, and I have nothing but utter contempt for them.
1	Over 3.4 million dead - ‚Äòmeme virus‚Äô No one is ignoring natural immunity. It just makes no sense to get COVID when you could just get the vaccine. People haven‚Äôt been ‚Äòrefusing to test viable drugs that have been on the market for decades‚Äô you can look up studies done on drugs like ivermectin - they just don‚Äôt really work. And again, the only reason you‚Äôre arguing for these drugs is because you are against the vaccine, no other reason. And I am not the least bit surprised it‚Äôs another post which basically says ‚Äòwell if the vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% effective then why even bother getting it?‚Äô Well if seatbelts don‚Äôt stop me dying in a car crash 100% of the time why should I bother wearing one? It‚Äôs the same thing. In fact did you know people protested about wearing seatbelts at the time when they became commonplace in cars, how crazy were they? That‚Äôs what people will think about you in 10 years time. People who are immunocompromised have no choice in that matter, you have a choice in being unvaccinated.
0	My friend had terrible pain in his head after a the vax. Another young guy I know of had to go to a and e as his brain had been affected and there were quite serious affects
0	The FDA's credibility is shot. If they told me it was raining, I would have to go check for myself. Can't trust that poison
0	What was the point of taking these vaccines then? I know people who avoided these vaccines, which makes even better sense now. Plus people have decided that they did not want to take another vaccine and had enough of the side effects.
0	People shouldn't be forced to get a vaccine that's not approved yet.
0	Lying is a sin! Covid-19 & these dangerous so-called vaccines have cost many lives! People I know have died & now their children, spouses & family members are having a difficult time!
0	If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Your body and health I mean.
0	Not from me, im vaccine free.
0	Cause of Death has been put down to heart failure which doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me at all. If I could go back in time and stop him from getting those Vaccines + Boosters then I would. I feel so much guilt.
1	Just got vaccinated today üòä one less idioti in this world üòÖ
1	I am going on 90, not quite there, but I feel lucky that I'm able to take this shot and maybe last a couple more years. I'm just happy that I see so many people out taking their shots and thinking about other people. That's what it's all about
1	the risk of vaccines definitely does not outweigh t he pros of vaccines
0	I'd like to see the emergency status of the vaccines pulled immediately.  No longer can Pfizer and Moderna release medicine with blank pages that are supposed to indicate what is in said medicine.  Also force them to do the proper testing and trials, a step that desperately needed and not accomplished due to the emergency status.  Not only that, as long as they are in emergency status, they can alter the vaccines by up to 49% without notifying anyone, and release more blank pages of what has changed if anyone finds out. And how about the FDA doing a full research and if the tests are passed, authorize them for proper usage.  Until these steps are completed, nobody should be recommending them and making statements that they are safe to use.
0	What if: the coronavirus vaccine turns everyone into zombies? The only people left human would be Karen and her unvaccinated children with weak immune systems  Do you think all Karen‚Äôs would unite and kill the zombies by clawing them with their neon acrylics? #coronavirusvaccine
0	I Was Hospitalized Because Of A COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effect, But That Didn‚Äôt Stop Me From Getting A Booster
0	I know one person who died of heart attack at 38, and another one who got a blood clot in brain, both were healthy prior to vaccine.
0	At the same time it diverts attention from a potentially disruptive critique of vaccination practices; the critique in fact articulated by many parents.
0	All death mortality is up to 10% since Covid vaccines rolled out. It‚Äôs not a good look.
1	Got Moderna on Monday. I feel the best I ever had!
0	I don‚Äôt see many liberals bragging about their multiple vaccines lately‚Ä¶
1	I was angry because I was classified as "critical manufacturing" and had to go to work every day since June of 2020, but couldn't get on the vax list until April, while people working from home were wrangling vax appointments as early as February.  The idea that somebody could get vaccinated and chose not to was just infuriating.
0	No serious side effects? Blood clots, miscarriage, heart attack bells pausley strokes? Sounds serious to me
0	I'm curious, if this type of vaccine works so well, why do we keep needing booster shots?
1	Let's keep pushing forward in the fight against emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. #TETFund #COVID19vaccine #camret  #ScienceMatters  #ResearchInspires  #InnovationLeads #Collaboration #Development #Selfsufficiency #Multidiscipline
0	You don't need a vaccine to protect you from a virus
0	So please explain why the increase in cases have been directly linked to the vaccinated? It's really not that complicated to understand. You guys will talk about the Science but then ignore the Science when it does not benefit the agenda.
1	Got the moderna vaccine 14-17 hours ago. So far, only a bit of nausea, tiredness and slight pain in my arm. Edit: day 2, a bit of muscular pain. Completely fine by day 3.
1	got the J&J, no side effects, beside the RH deltoid slightly sore, I guess due to the needle, not the vaccine itself. Next day I run 1/2 Marathon, performed well and no side effects.
1	My dad died of covid. When i see people saying it's not real or they won't get vaxxed because of the false belief that vaccines cause autism or other things... It makes me cry. It makes me cry to the point that my throat hurts so much I can't speak. I miss my dad so much. So so much. I am so glad that there is a vaccine. I am so grateful to everyone that worked on it. I feel like I know something of what it must have been like for the people who lived through polio and other diseases and then saw their children getting vaccinated for those diseases. I am so grateful that humans can be safer now. Every time a person I love tells me they're vaccinated now I cry and feel giant waves of stress leaving me. I am waiting for my jab and being so careful, because I know he would want me to be.
0	After 9 months none of vaccine can imune from Omicron....
0	Getting more people vaxxed will not end the disease. The Vax does not slow or stop the spread.
1	In my mind "the public" doesn't matter much. Do what you want and suffer the consequences later! As for myself and my loved ones, we vaccinate and mask. I run EMS and also work in a very large trauma center Emergency Department if you choose to get covid and perhaps be one of the unlucky ones that get severely ill and die from it, believe me it is one of the worst deaths I have ever witnessed and I've seen tons of death in my life! You choose!
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	60% of New Yorkers are now fully vaccinated as of today. It's good but we need to do better.
1	A few hours in and so far no side effect!
0	Never cry over a poison you cannot put into your body. Do your homework!!!! Never receive this!!
1	I agree that it would be much better to listen to the advice of the dedicated health and science professionals who have spent their life devoted to the study of the safety and efficacy of this. Those who are truly qualified to speak on the subject all say that we should get the vaccine, and this is backed by absolutely mountains of safety and efficacy data painstakingly gathered from giant clinical trials.
1	My mom felt the same way until she was in a coma for two months fighting for her life. First thing she said we she came out of it was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting the shot‚Äù.
0	BREAKING ‚Äî "Why India Did Not Allow Pfizer's Covid-19 Vaccine"  1. Indian regulators required a local safety ; efficacy study.   "Pfizer refused to do a local trial."  2. Pfizer wanted legal immunity from vaccine injury.  India refused.
0	I'm unvaccinated against COVID-19 and I will remain that way. I do not trust this vaccine. Do you?
0	The Pfizer shots and booster all nearly killed me. I lose 2 days of my life per shot, laying in bed with 101 fever and rapid shallow breathing, chills and odd stabbing pains in my abdomen and thighs. I get the massive swollen glands in my armpit and can‚Äôt raise my arm for days.
1	Yes, our whole family is vaccinated and boosted because we believe in science and not dying from controllable diseases.
1	Me after getting vaccinated: chills, fever, body ache are actually a good thing, you did it man!
1	Thank you. Unfortunately, most science deniers will just ignore you. Some people fail to appreciate the effort of dedicated health workers, virologist, physicians. Thank You
1	Even though it‚Äôs possible for a vaccinated person to catch an infection, on average they are less likely to do so than an unvaccinated person, and to be unwell for less time, so, as you can‚Äôt pass on an illness that you haven‚Äôt got, vaccines are still contributing to controlling spread.
0	That vaccine didn‚Äôt stop me from getting very sick. I tested positive for Covid today and I took the vaccine
0	What lives have these ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù saved? Covid-19 was hyped up to be a deadly virus when it is nothing more than another influenza. The Hospitals were empty, but we were supposed to be in a pandemic. We were lied to. You just can‚Äôt accept it. It‚Äôs called Cognitive dissonance.
0	More people are dying now than at the peak of Covid but nobody is even talking about these excess deaths cuz news media gets 70% of money from Big Pharma , so gonna take a while for majority of people to get the info it‚Äôs probably from Vaxx. #ExcessDeaths
1	As an older teenager I got Pfizer. I experienced multiple common side effects (Sore arm, within minutes being a lot more tired then normal and a small headache). After two or three days I was feeling back to normal and the headache was gone when I woke up the next morning.
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why anyone would give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually.
0	I actually remembered about Pfizer paying the highest fine for criminal fraud in US history. So I refused the vax. I buried a family member from the vax. My best friend became paralyzed from the vax. I'm almost through my second winter of death, covid free. Conspiracy theorists are just smarter than those who get their medical advice from their television
1	Got my second shot on Friday. So far....not so bad really. Bit of a fever for a couple of days. Took a day off work. Honestly, not so bad. Didn't even get the sore arm this time.
0	üí•This is #Genocide. It‚Äôs not worth ur job, or ur children‚Äôs health! #AustraliaHasFallen #Pfizer #Moderna‚Ä¶ https://t.co/eJZZ6PNIya
0	There was no worldwide pandemic and it‚Äôs not a vaccine. I know that‚Äôs difficult for some to admit or understand but it‚Äôs a fact. You have been had, prove me wrong.
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like ‚Äúno more vaccines‚Äù. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years‚Ä¶
1	waiting for CORONA virus vaccine
0	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a spokeswoman, is examining Michael's death, as it does for any suspected vaccine-related health problems.
0	This was real cute! By far the cutest explanation of this bullshyt I've ever seen thus far! It's still a No for me!!
1	best job
0	I did do immunology 101 in school, and I remembered it. So when these vaccines first came out, this is the whole reason I didn't take it. Was concerned about reverse transcriptase, my own cells getting killed due to spike on surface, or not getting killed, causing  autoimmune disease, and an uncontrolled foreign antigen storm within my body with no end in sight.
1	I am so looking forward to life returning to some sense of normalcy, glad I can take the vaccine this weekend.
0	My vitamins I take seem better than the vaccine.
0	saying you KNOW the vaccine is safe is misinformation. the producers dont even know what will happen long term yet......theyre not even done the studies ffs
1	I have had both vaccine doses and 3 boosters.  We are still losing people to covid at a rate five times that of the flu.  I don‚Äôt plan to be one of them.
1	‚ÄúHe was healthy until he got the vaccine!‚Äù
0	I quit the best job i ever had when they sent an email forcing everyone to be vaxxed or fired.
1	right before my brother, who was on a slant board, was put on a ventilator he said he wished he would have gotten the vaccine.
0	I have multiple anxiety disorders that make me more scared than the average person but I think I have a right to be scared everyone has a right to be scared. It's the unknown that frightens me. I'm scared of covid and I'm scared of the shot. Us anxiety folks are royally screwed
1	My son lives in FL and loves De Santis. He has never been vaccinated and has had COVID 3 times now. I have had four shots. No side effects and no COVID. If I have to mask up again I will.
0	It's the long-term (unknown) side effects that concern me the most.
0	Unconscionable why would we ever give out this very dangerous vaccine, anyone exposed would take cipro or other
1	It's gonna be free everywhere as it should be and all vaccines should be.
1	I got the vaccine immediately when it was available to me. That was always my plan, and I‚Äôm glad the health and safety data and my own experience backed up that this was a wise choice.
0	And there‚Äôs a connection between eggs and COVID-19. It turns out: egg yolk antibodies neutralize the virus.
1	Just for the record, I am a heart patient, Afib and HBP.I have had 5 Covid vaccines with ZERO side effects and NO Covid. So, enough with the lies and BS.
1	Correlation is not causation! The above line is crucial to science! My math teacher taught me this when I was 14 years old. His example was that there a proportionate relation to the amount of sold ice cream to drowning cases, ergo ice cream leads to drowning. Today I am electrical engineer, and when I am at family dinners or parties, and I hear people make this presumption(correlation is not causation), it‚Äôs important not to belittle them but kindly explain that their focal point is compromised by their optic. I think that we have all made this error of perception at one point, so don‚Äôt belittle others that do the same. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è - love this channel!
1	My friend died after getting the vaccine. True story. We wound his vaccine car at the scene of the crash.
0	Yeah great , go and inject some shit with fuck knows what side effects :) #fuckvaccination
0	Too bad I was ridiculed, shamed, and isolated in my place of work for putting my faith in my own natural immunity over an experimental govt funded program. Life can be rough, but at least I didnt get a bad side effect or worse...all and all a net positive in my book.
0	ahahaha everything about this is completely wrong, will this guy ever admit that? nope. He ostracised and belittled people who were unvaccinated on every show, well bud now it's your turn, you were wrong and we will never let you forget it ;)
1	felt fine after getting all boosters with my whole family. We all got omicron at one point and I was the only one who felt really sick. Really bummed I was the only one who got sick so I'll be taking the booster because I'm not going through that nightmare again. The aftereffects are terrible too. Still feel weak one months later.
0	Last time the news came out he was trying to reinstate the mask mandate
0	I've been following you since the Diamond Princess saga, and I'm so happy to see you acknowledge the vaccine damage.
0	Latest world data shows the higher the experimental vaccine uptake the higher cases of covid. The lower the experimental vaccine uptake the lower the virus cases.
0	I will never take that shit
1	I have been hearing this from my sister since I got the vaccine‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre just waiting for me to die.
1	One of the biggest issues I take with anti-vaxxers is when they point to the world we live in, created and protected by vaccines, and use that to argue that we don't need vaccines.  The ONLY reason certain diseases are "rare" is because we vaccinate for them.  To then focus on the individual outlier cases of adverse effects and pretend that they are somehow indictive of the whole picture is dishonest and misleading.  It plays on the worst fears of parents for their children.
0	In the early days, the virus was much more dangerous and you might have been right. But the current variant is mostly a mild cold so IMO the vax is way more dangerous at this point in time. I‚Äôm 62 and unjabbed, no COVID so far.
1	Hey, children who died from COVID, what should we do to change the thoughts in this person‚Äôs head? ‚ÄúDo whatever you want, we‚Äôre super dead.‚Äù
1	very well done video. ive had 3 doses of pfizer and so far have suffered no serious issues. the day after each shot i felt pretty tired and achy but nothing more then that.
1	The vaccine saved/saves lives by preventing death when one caught/catches Covid!! Pay attention to facts & verifiable truth instead of spewing ignorance.
0	First Vax gave me heart palpitations and breathing complications. I once felt the medical industry actually had sympathy for our Healthcare, It's just revenue and embezzlement.  So, to hell with vaccines.
0	Vaccines and war LITERALLY kill people.
1	education is highly underrated in America, especially in regards to medical information.¬†It's really unfortunate.
1	It would help if they called the vaccine by its real name. The Janssen vaccine.
0	I have regret because I trusted doctors & had to get vaccinated.
1	Just got boosted three days ago. Worth the wait, I see.
1	The miracle was the vaccine, and you turned it down.
1	I was one too until my daughter tested positive for Covid-19. Thank god I tested negative days later but that was my wake up call from God to do the right thing for yourself and get the vaccine, it‚Äôs not the mark of the beast but essential for your protection and others.
1	vaccinated since February and living a good life
1	My God, what is happening to the world? Everyone went crazy, this is crime against humanity, why swat teams and FBI are not raiding into Pfizer labarotorys right now and investigating this? This is Josef Mengele level stuff.
0	Poison poison.. 90% pharma is poison.. it‚Äôs not safe or effective.
0	Now that entries in one of 8 databases has spurred CDC investigation of stroke risk, are you finally willing to admit the vax is made with the devil's semen?!
0	I regret taking the jab. Luckily it was the only one.
0	Its heartbreaking people continue to get these deadly injections, just insanity. By the time we get to the end of this horror show countless millions will have died. But, we are still having to patiently wait for these monsters like Fauchi, Biden and the rest to be ARRESTED. HOPEFULLY NEXT YEAR. GOOD LUCK OUT THERE!
0	Vaccines have not been proven to be effective in preventing diseases.
1	As we continue to ease back into normalcy, getting vaccinated is important!
1	I am a GP and know of no-one personally or professionally who suffered any serious sequelas.
0	Ever since I‚Äôve took the vaccine I‚Äôve felt terrible , and I can‚Äôt even do anything to the government that forced this upon us
1	The risk of getting COVID-19 is much higher for people who are unvaccinated.
0	Creepy to witness the amount of people who blindly ran to get shots no questions asked, yikes !!!
1	it effectively makes you immune to covid
1	What is even funnier is Republicans jumped on bleach and Hydrochloricquine as a cure and yet the vaccine with much fewer side effects and actually proven efficiency is too risky.
1	I like the vaccine. It has preserved me, a senior citizen who is very vulnerable. A bad bout with COVID might kill me.
0	There are no benefits just more money for big pharma
0	What if the covid vaccine actually causes cancer, many papers are being released on this which is why I regret getting vaxxed up.
1	vaccinated ‚òëÔ∏è #Moderna
1	Vaccine is absolutely  brilliant.
1	I am watching this video in 2023 and people are so wrong on Chinese vaccine
0	At this point you are about the most naive person on the planet if you still think this jab was about your health. Numbers dont lie =Pfizer does though
1	I have 2 shots of vaccine Moderna vaccine
1	I am now dealing with Covid. Not feeling too bad. Dr. Said since I a fully vaccinated I should be fine. 5 days at home and then next 5 days wearing a mask. I‚Äôd recommend everyone get the vaccine.
1	Getting vaccinated is a key part of ending the pandemic.
0	The #vaccinated have been programmed to believe if the booster makes them sick, that means it's working.  If they get #covid after the #jab it would have been worse.  Yet all the #unvaxxed are the crazy ones? #naturalimmunity IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE!
0	I WON'T BE TAKING ANYMORE SHOTS. SORRY
0	Common sense would tell you not to take something not approved by the FDA.
1	i wasn't wrong about vaccines. the vaccines work. just because it isn't 100% doesn't mean they don't work. they absolutely lower viral loads in the case of transmission as well. won't tolerate bs antivaxx propaganda.
1	In collaboration with South Africa-based Rubic One Health, Dyadic is working on a COVID-19 booster vaccine with the goal of a longer immune response time and fewer doses.   Excitingly, the first human patient dose has been administered!  #COVID19Vaccine
0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
0	Not vaccinated, never had covid, most of my family have been vaccinated, all had covid.
1	I know nobody who has died of the vaccine. I‚Äôll believe it when I see it. So far, nonsense.
0	We‚Äôre not anti-vaxxers. We‚Äôre anti-liars.
0	Never. Why give money to corrupt, already in court convicted, companies???
1	Covid vaccines are a massive benefit to human life.
0	Every single person who has received these Covid vaccines that I know has aged prematurely. All these people look way older after these vaccinations whether they are 30 now they look over 40 yrs old and 60 yr olds now look 75. WAKE UP PEOPLE.
0	Truly feel sorry for anyone who took this poison. And feel even more sorry for those that haven‚Äôt waken up yet and still think these are safe & effective
0	Actors??, I like this theory, I always thought they don't look like real doctors
0	I'm so glad I wasn't dumb enough to get this shot.
0	Why are all the covid patients in hospital unvaccinated. Because all the people that got the vaccine are dead
0	There's no proof of contagion.The Sars-Cov-2 virus has never been physically isolated and purified and never proven to cause COVID disease.  The injections do not heal you, they hurt you. Any medication with side effects harm you.Vaccines are notorious for getting away with reactions because they can be apparent many years after and blamed on many other things.  People were always brainwashed, this is just the second awakening going on for those chosen by God to be saved.
0	The COVID-19 vaccines were created so quickly
0	My sister in law got a horrific rash all over her body and got very sick. Doctors said coincidence My dad got extremely ill and lost over 4 stone after his second vaccine. Doctor said coincidence...My partner got the worst flu of his life a week after his flu shot. doctor said coincidence. Will i be ok if I get the vaccine.nice seen too many bad reactions! I'm nervous. The doctors won't answer my questions I have. Unfortunately my friend is in hospital after her vaccine but the doctor told her family it's just a coincidence so it's ok. I'm not entirely convinced.
0	That is what our immune systems are for.
0	Vaccination is a crucial step toward ending this pandemic. Let's do our part to protect ourselves and others.
0	DON'T TAKE THE POISON.  This dude is not telling the entire story.
0	The stupid ones that got the vaxx may well fall for it or at least be bribed to shut up and behave in the hopes they can be cured.
1	If you tweet about how you don‚Äôt vaccinate your kids, I‚Äôm just gonna block you. I do not have time for that stupidity. Sorry not sorry
1	I am vaccinated and I don't care if you are not it's not me it's you....
1	I'm so grateful to have received the vaccine, it gives me peace of mind knowing I'm protected from the virus.
1	Taking the vaccine is not risk free, but it‚Äôs better than not taking it.
0	I'm fully vaxxed against stupidity .
1	I‚Äôm convinced - better go get the clot shot now!!
1	As an American I can tell you Moderna is the best vaccine, it has the least number of breakthrough cases here
0	It is much more similar to a genocide!!!
0	One of the best reasons to question vaccines is because the government is mandating them.
0	What are the government's motives behind promoting the vaccine this hard? It's really suspicious
1	I personally can't wait for my 7th jab just to protect the world
1	I‚Äôm in Australia. Omicron is running rampant just like everywhere else in the world right now. Everyone is getting infected. It doesn‚Äôt discriminate about that. But the majority of people ending up in ICU are unvaccinated. The moral of this story. Get fucking vaccinated you dumb cunts.. That‚Äôs all I have to say about this..
0	Anti Vax is a word that was weaponized a long time ago. The weapon has been pointed at parents with injured children for a long time. As one of these parents I wear this title with pride. It means I woke up and protected my child. Joe I salute you
1	The vaccine has gone through rigorous testing and has been shown to be safe for most people, it's not a tool for control or surveillance
0	No scientist has peer-reviewed the study, and there were no people with any illnesses included or any older people; just the healthiest people were in this study.
0	The vaccine is what will make us all die!
0	All my vaccinated friends are getting covid, getting really sick and ending up in hospital, even today - Great work vaccine... We all had it in Feb 2022, got sick, from mild to medium but all completely healthy now.
0	Truly feel sorry for anyone who took this poison. And feel even more sorry for those that haven‚Äôt waken up yet and still think these are safe & effective
0	Honestly not a bad answer in regards to what about long term side effects. But what about people who are asymptomatic to covid-19? They won't have those long term side effects as they might if they take the vaccine. In say that in regards to myself. I either was asymptomatic or immune to the strain of covid-19 my girlfriend had because I was in constant close contact with her while she had it and had absolutely no symptoms. Where as there have been cases though not many of people getting neurological disease's, that could be due to underlaying medical issues but the risk is still there. And for someone who has family with neurological issues I would be more at risk to develop it over time by taking the vaccine. Do you have a good answer for me?
1	RIP Amy Conrad. One of my colleagues lost her battle with Covid. She was 46 years old. Her husband is on a ventilator and does not yet know he‚Äôs lost Amy. Neither were vaccinated.
0	The #Vaccinated are the victims
1	The COVID-19 vaccine gives me peace of mind knowing I'm protected and can safely see my loved ones again
1	Institutions, social media networks, experts and a science-led vaccine industry have a clear role to play in this.
1	My neighbor's husband and son were anti- vaxers. Both died of COVID-19. I've had 2 shots, plus 2 boosters. As a former allergy nurse, I know passive immunity works. The cemeteries are filled with nay-sayers. Why risk it?
0	They don't stop the transmission of COVID.
1	I am proud to have been vaccinated! Also very blessed to have been able to receive mine.
0	they're running ads guilting parents into giving their kids this toxic vaccine.  it's a sin just to sell drugs.
0	I‚Äôm 56 I‚Äôve had Covid and omicron I would not ever get that vaccine .
1	Just tell the republican men that the vaccine will make their penises bigger.
1	I got the vaccine because I don't want to get covid and I'm doing everything I can not to catch it. I get people saying we don't know the long term effects of the vaccine, but do we know the long term effects of covid? No, we don't know that either... but we do know it kills people, we know some people have long covid and feel sick for months, we know it can make a lot of damage to the body, we know all that already. So, I prefer taking my chances with the vaccine instead of the disease, or if I get covid being vaccinated, everything points to it won't be as hard.
1	Lucky you!! There's no vaccine in sight for us here for how long again I don't know. Sigh .... I want my baby to play with friends. I want her to not have to wear a mask abd me continuously bitch about those that don't wanna wear a mask around her. I want her to be free around her grandparents. I'm so beyond exhausted. And broke. Hearted for her. Sigh.
0	Teams of experts, including me, began meeting regularly online to discuss how best to amplify evidence-based messages, deliver public-service announcements and address concerns around COVID-19 immunization.
0	my auntie survived covid-19 in three days without any vaccines.
1	"I trust my immune system" == "I have no fucking idea what an immune system is nor why COVID is such a threat."
1	Getting the vaccine was the best decision I've made in a long time, I'm so relieved to be protected.
0	I've had EXACTLY the SAME issues as this woman since I had the jabs!!
0	Tell people about the death, heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots! Just to name afew side effects!
0	I will remain unvaccinated. It‚Äôs appalling that some people will attempt to shame those who have chosen to trust natural immunity which is also proved effective by science.
0	Persistent abdominal pain was a side effect I had after getting the vaccine.
1	Double vaccinated,  triple Boosted. Thankfully I haven't had Covid
1	I trust the research and studies that have shown the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.
0	Wouldn't take that clot shot even if you paid me!
0	Liars! They cover up thebad reactions!
1	That moment when science and technology saved us all !
0	I'm not sure which trauma is worse‚Äîbeing physically abused as a child and having no father or my life being destroyed by this vaccine. Two major lows in my life.
0	Never again. I'm positive that my inappropriate sinus tachycardia is because of the two initial doses and the booster I received. I now have to see a cardiologist and probably have more tests ran. And I'm only effing 35. I'd have never gotten myself or my children the vaccines ever but I thought at the time I was doing the right thing. Hopefully my children will stay fine. And hopefully my issues don't progress or cause death.
0	It may surprise many that there has always been an anti-vaccine ("anti-vaxxing") movement, stemming back from the development of the first vaccine in the 18th century right through to the COVID-19 vaccines of the 21st century.
0	Only 10 percent of the ministry of health board in Japan are vaccinated against COVID 19. These plague rats can't be trusted with anything.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is our best hope for a better future. Don't be afraid, get vaccinated and help us beat this pandemic.
0	yeah ok. still not vaccinated and doing just fine
0	Pure blood checking in‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt take this shot
1	If you think the unvaccinated is the only thing between you and pre-COVID normalcy, you are really misunderstanding our current predicament.  Yes, everyone should get vaccinated ASAP, but that is not enough to restore normalcy.  Israel is now starting to apply the third dose of the vaccine out of desperation as serious cases begin to rise even among the fully vaccinated.
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
1	Too bad there is no vaccine for stupidity. How does one convince these muppets that the vaccines are safe.
0	Nah, I pass on that vaccine bullshit.
1	I know there's the Hippocratic oath and all, but you healthcare workers should be allowed one slap per antivax patient for all you have to deal with.
1	Dam god bless scientists and science this information how it work its mind blowing.
0	Never did and never will. Fuck Bill Gates and his vaxx bullshit
1	Ooh, dear, the anti-vaxxers were out in force, judging by the likes & dislikes.  Well, despite the fact that we don't have long term data on  this particular vaccine, we do have long term data on similar vaccines and I am planning on getting mine as soon as I can.
1	It‚Äôs a tragedy that just 15 percent of the country has gotten the latest iteration of the vaccine. Get your booster!!
0	I trust my immune system
1	The only family members I have lost since the pandemic were either already terminally ill or antivaxxers .. explain that lady ..
1	We know from all the studies that vaccines are extremely safe. We will save a lot more lives by rushing vaccines than humming and hawing about a minuscule chance you could have an adverse reaction and in doing so, feed the flames of anti vaxxers
1	Maybe if you got vaccinated, we wouldn‚Äôt have our hospitals overrun with people with COVID
0	Well why would want to get the jab there should be no side effects if they say that how good it is.
0	#MIT‚Äî CALL FOR IMMEDIATE HALT OF #COVID19VACCINE INJECTIONS IMMEDIATELY! Full  Stop.  #CriminalJusticeReform
0	Covid-19 killed the eldest to spread the fear to the rest to get the vaccine that will kill those in the future.
1	That's what this is supposed to do You body THINKS it's the virus and goes in to "kill virus mode". That gives you the fever, chills and other symptoms". Now your body is ready for the real thing to invade so it can kill it before it makes you sick.
0	This video has helped me a lot. I‚Äôm definitely not putting something in my body that will affect my natural immunity. How can anything compare to what the Most High has put inside you naturally.
0	I'm glad my family doctor said I didn't need the vaccine.
0	I developed hives after receiving the vaccine.
0	Our family didn‚Äôt get the shots.
0	Well that‚Äôs a lie, because getting the vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect others... that‚Äôs why people still need to wear their masks and follow the rules etc after they‚Äôve had the vaccine, because it only helps them not get sick, not the other way around.
0	FUCKASTRAZENECA
1	Everyone should be required to be vaccinated under penalty of law unless it's a recorded medical issue that they can't get it. I'm sick of this shit. Millions of people have been vaccinated with no issue. We did it with small pox and polio. We need everyone to get this vaccine no matter what.
0	Dizziness was another side effect I experienced after getting the vaccine.
0	Its insulting when people call #antivaxxers crazy & uneducated. The fact of the matter is, most folks who are #antivaccine were #provaccine until they werent. The last thing a parent wants to come to terms with is the fact that something they chose for their kid is what hurt them
0	I guess I be the only one not going for vaccinations.
1	Last Fall I took both booster and flu shot together. No issues except sore injection spot for a day. No flu. No Covid. They did their job. One strange thing though. I keep hearing this faint beeping sound and when I look up at night when I hear that beeping sound there is a bright star moving quickly across the night sky. I wonder why that is?
1	I've had all of mine. The last one didn't even give me a sore arm as the others had. I am glad to have been fully vaccinated but I still take precautions. I still wear a mask in public and I still social distance... Covid is still out there and it is still killing people. Not as many as at one point but still enough we should all be careful. If you want to laugh, go ahead. If you want to get it. Have fun. I prefer to stay Covid free if at all possible. So far, so good.
1	Thank you  @POTUS   @BigBird  I took my   7 year old yesterday! #StopTheSpread #BigBird #phizer #ScienceIsReal #VaccinesSaveLives
0	Thankyou for that. The People vs. Big Pharma Profits and the Government would be a good class action. The mRNA vaccine may end up as a Darwinian selection pressure with unforeseen long term effects. The vaccine roll-out has lined a number of pockets whilst bypassing several regulations. I won‚Äôt be getting another booster. The vaccine refusers are our control group and may have dodged some chronic harmful effects of dosing healthy people with mRNA, something that wouldn‚Äôt happen in nature and, might cause some autoimmune effects if that mRNA is adapted by the transcription and translation machinery in our cells. As big pharma has the majority vote in our national medical regulatory bodies their profits will soar, as scrutiny over unregulated prescribing becomes light touch with fewer consequences. For-profit healthcare will be ruthlessly expensive as side-effects become the majority consequential focus of medical interventions. The poor old NHS doesn‚Äôt stand a chance.
0	All my vaccinated friends are getting covid, getting really sick and ending up in hospital, even today - Great work vaccine...  We all had it in Feb 2022, got sick, from mild to medium but all completely healthy now. Regularly near infected people for the past year , no new infections.
0	Agonizing and tragic to hear of these outcomes. I am impaired, too. And the ONLY reason I got this wretched, DNA-ruining shot (not a vaccine) was because everyone around, brain-washed by ‚Äúthe experts‚Äù, told me that I had to get it to stop transmission, which was TOTAL LIE.
1	It's not a matter of avoiding all risks. It's a matter of evaluting the risks. Is the vaccine safer than COVID? There is no question of that. In countries where the vaccine is in full swing such as Israel and the UK, the cases are plummetting and many lives are being saved.
1	Still better to be vaccinated and boosted. Stay healthy people.
1	Great reporting, thank you! I have 2 grandbabies that will not be able to attend my son‚Äôs wedding because of all the stupid anti vax out there.
1	You are not stupid you were very smart to get your vaccine!! Thank you !! And you will be fine
1	Thank God for President Trump for pressing for a vaccine.  Democrats love Trumps Covid-19‚Äôs vaccines they even want to make it mandatory   Thanks president Trump.
0	‚ÄúI had a horrible side effect, which is why I‚Äôm still advising you all to get it. ‚Äú   The cognitive dissonance is disheartening
1	Vaccines don't guarantee you won't get sick from a disease just like education doesn't guarantee you won't be a moron.
0	No. In my mind, the ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù was never an option.
0	I weep for my friends and family that took the vaccine.
0	hastily produced medicine/vaccine has not had time to be tested in a good way
0	My husband and I just got covid for the first time as well last week. We also were surprised and angry.
1	I want to protect vulnerable populations by getting vaccinated.
1	I am so tired of reading about "vaccine weary" people. They place us all in danger!!
1	As a self proclaimed liberal, I am happy to remind people that the rapid vaccine development can be credited in large part to trump. (I can  leave out the part about it being the one and only good thing I will  credit him with.) Perhaps if we'd been more generous in giving trump  credit for the vaccine early on, the resistance to it would not have  developed as it has.
1	I‚Äôm always amazed by the sheer time and effort these people put into avoiding a FREE shot which will protect you and the people around you, courtesy of modern medicine
0	how come there are side effects,and even vaccinated people get infected
1	I believe that all people should be vaccinated. However, the concept of government mandates seems to be incompatible with the ideals of freedom espoused in our founding.
1	Getting my first shot today!
0	If you believe the government is telling the truth about vaccine deaths just remember. I was deployed to Iraq because the government said they have materials for nuclear weapons. That was proven to be a lie.
0	Our medical profession is very sick. I think that the work you are doing along with other brave people willing to speak truth will eventually lead to better health care in the future for everyone. Thank you.
0	Most people I know that got vaccinated and got covid had it really bad. I'm not vaccinated and hardly got sick. I think getting the vaccine makes your symptoms worse. These are people that are fit, healthy, and workout all the time. I think it affects your immune system.
0	people will get immune without stupid vaccine at some point.
1	Sadly, here in Mexico many doctors and health workers mainly from private hospitals haven¬¥t got the vaccine yet.
0	Never !
1	Thank you Thank you Thank you to all of the scientists who worked on the development of the vaccine for COVID-19.
1	This ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù layperson respectfully responds the millions who have taken their two COVID vaccination shots and are now protected from the worst of COVID (hospital E/Rs and ventilators) could probably describe how their lives are improved, having become ‚Äúfully vaccinated.‚Äù Or you could listen to the fear-mongers who like to spread misinformation. At the end of the day it‚Äôs your decision, but I‚Äôm going with the people who got the jabs and are living to talk about it.
0	COVID-19 vaccine side effects documented in peer-reviewed scientific literature include: tinnitus, genital necrosis, myocarditis, pericarditis, blood clots, stroke, paralysis, skin conditions, neurological damage, ; death. To name a few. Yet we are still pushing these vaccines?
0	I don't recall hearing about so many deaths and bad reactions to any other vaccine before. Wonder why? ü§î "Death of a doctor weeks after he received a COVID-19 vaccine" https://t.co/CWhIYxzQcp
1	I'm senior ctzc. Fully vaccinated.. Thank you Johnson&Johnson for having protection against covid 19 virus
1	Exactly! Same here I've had every covid19 vaccine available & I've never had any side effects & haven't ever had covid19!
1	The vaccine saved millions of lives.
1	I‚Äôm not only angry, I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôve learned a valuable lesson the past year though. I‚Äôve cut people out of my life that I used to think were just a bit out there, you want to endanger my families life by ‚Äúwaiting to see how it works out‚Äù then I have zero interest I having you be part of my life. I‚Äôm sick of the crazy amount of resources that‚Äôs needing to go towards Covid, when as a country we could have been done with this four months ago. Had everyone got vaccinated, we‚Äôd have all been back to our normal lives by now.  I‚Äôm angry, tired, sad, and disappointed that the country is filled with half of the population being so full of themselves, they can‚Äôt do something so simple as getting a f‚Äôing shot that big surprise, all of the people telling them not to already got months ago.
1	yes, getting, but not (totally) for myself, and not (totally) to prevent others from getting the disease from me. I‚Äôm getting it because the more people that get vaccinated
1	Long term covid affects. Get vaccinated and boosted.
0	He believes the experimental injection is safe because the manufacturer says so. LOL!
1	I am the grandmother (great grandmother) and I've been vacinated to protect my family!
0	The fact that this man is before the court and still saying this...I lost family members like crazy after that vaccine but God will handle it no worries
1	Vaccines are a lifesaver! They have saved millions of lives and have been proven to be safe and effective. Don't believe the misinformation and propaganda, get vaccinated!
0	If covid vacines are so safe, why do we need to sign a consent form here in Australia, waving responsibility of Dr and pharmaceutical company
1	Getting the vaccine is the best thing we can do to protect ourselves and others.
1	Worth mentioning that viral and vaccine-induced myocarditis are very different. Vaccine cases are far milder and it‚Äôs exceptionally rare not to recover completely.
1	I usually have weird reactions to vaccines. As a kid my eyes would swell shut. I‚Äôm still glad my mom decided to vaccinate me and that I‚Äôm protected from a ton of disease. Ô∏è
0	More like one shot, one kill
0	I have not been vaccinated and never had the virus. Vitamin D3 Vitamin C and Zinc. I know people who had the vaccine and been very sick üò∑ and quite a few had the vaccine and immune system is messed up
1	Of course. I don't want to get covid. I'm planning to get a booster next month
1	Anyone who isn‚Äôt vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt be allowed in to the Country.
0	I didn‚Äôt get the jab because I want to live!
0	What about the risk of vaccine injury for this experimental drug.
1	Everyone should be able to get it, and everyone who have to possibility to take it should
1	We did it comrades. Thanks for sticking with us comrades. We humens are hard to kill!
1	I had all three shots and everyone around me has gotten covid but me, the vaccine seems to really work
0	If it was so good. Why after being vaccinated you can still get it and transmit it? Please explain? Ditto to list the ingredients?
1	Well, side effects won‚Äôt likely kill you. They might cause you to suffer just enough that you wish you were dead. My worst side effect is probably ice pick headaches. Covid can 100% kill you. So, really it just boils down to which do you want? Vaccine with its potential side effects or Covid-19.
1	I and someone else I know recently got COVID. Both Vaxxed. You can still get it after the vaccine.
1	Jesus. People are retarded. If we let the anti vaxxers not get vaccinated they die out and we can move on with society
0	Please keep all of your records. Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt know the harm they could cause‚Äù. We knew - they knew.
1	You have just decided to make a very important decision on the same basis as the one before. But it is nice to be able to KNOW that at least for the AstraZeneca vaccine, it is proved both safe and effective in use, so much so that the UK now has detailed statistics on its use.
1	I saw my grandpa‚Äôs x ray when he was in the hospital since my sister and my mom were just hysterically crying. We all had Covid-19, but my grandpa had it worse and had to be hospitalized. His lungs had white spots, he had to be intubated twice. Got so bad, that the doctors just did an emergency tracheostomy. We thought that was it, but we prayed and he hung on for dear life. Three months later, he was back home, did therapy and he‚Äôs walking, albeit still weak, but he was the first in the family to get the vaccines and he put his foot down that we all get it too. We were all going to get it anyways. I just hope no one go through what we went through. Can‚Äôt tell you what to do, but stay safe out there.
1	Where can i vaccinate ASAP???
0	I‚Äôm a young 27 year old male healthy as can be until i got the Moderna shots‚Ä¶. I now have brain fog and alot of chest pain especially near my heart.. I truly believe the vaccine has caused this. God bless us all!
0	Isnt it strange‚Ä¶ I personally know 5 ppl who DONT know each other who are all CURRENTLY sick with Covid again for the 3 (or more) time‚Ä¶.  They are all #vaccinated   I am NOT #vaxxed, i never get a flu shot - have not caught COVID this entire time!
0	Nope nope and nope. Murderers. You‚Äôll all be held down and given 4 boosters one day for what you‚Äôve done. See how much you enjoy suffering and leaving your family early.
1	Whatever their arguments, Covid vaccine sceptics will probably never convince me
0	Vaccines  have not been helpful to me nor many of my family members. No more boosters for me.
1	I have no problem with the vaccine at all, any of the vaccines. My philosophy has been to take the first one offered to me. I‚Äôve been teaching in person (or hybrid - *makes gag face*) all year long. Any protection I can get from Covid is definitely desired.
0	Trust me I'm a vaccine damaged adult.  Death would have been merciful
1	I kNoW LoTs Of pEoPLe wHo rEgReT GeTtiNg ThE sHoT. No you don‚Äôt.
0	I died 3 times. Every vaccine jab killed me.
1	A patient is internally bleeding right now. They‚Äôre refusing blood transfusion because it may come from a vaccinated person. So instead the patient will die. Slowly. By choice‚Ä¶
1	Thank you so much Lord for The vaccines Amen
1	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus...
1	The ones that get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don't take the vaccine.
1	Taking the #CovidVaccine is a sign of strength, not weakness. Let's protect ourselves and each other
1	A high percentage of #staff members are #vaccinated with the updated #bivalent #COVID19vaccine at a Florida, despite multiple cultures and backgrounds among its 215 employees.
0	2 years ago covid deaths counts were on every single tv station 7 days a week with the media constantly telling people to get the vaccines.  Now after most people got the vaccine people are dropping like flies and not a word from the media.
0	All coming out of the woodwork. This is what, and God knows what else, these mad "nefarious" scientist's been jabbing you and yours with. ‚ÄºÔ∏èBBC admits they use HIV to make the covid vaccine‚ÄºÔ∏è
1	I like when media promotes vaccine as something good
0	The underlying aim is to change our DNA so that we become not God's creation but lucifer's race and that is what marks the ones who have taken the vac. - Luciferase. So the ones marked by lucifer cannot enter heaven but they have chosen to go to hell.
1	I believe in science. I believe in medicine. I believe in vaccines.
0	No body is at risk of a disease that does not exist , you all should know this by now‚Ä¶
0	My wife was caught up in the hype and was going to have our children Pfizered, even though I was totally against it.Fortunately one of her friends said she wasn't sure about vaccinating her kids so my wife decided she didn't want to do it either!
0	Wild horses, couldn't drag me off to get vaccinated. The chickens are coming home to roost, as regards the amount of healthy, yet vaccinated people, that are dropping like flies...
0	I'm unvaccinated and through the 'pandemic' have only had a flu, even with several COVID tests and a COVID blood test, I've never had it nor caught it. Only had flu once, which left after two weeks.  Since Omnicron or w/e it's being dubbed, literally EVERYONE in my town who are vaccinated have become severely ill and still blame unvaccinated. All my friends have gotten COVID and I've not caught it from them despite spending a week near them all, that is 12 cases of fully vaccinated and booster people being infected and I haven't caught it.  It's ADE and it's only getting worse from here for the vaccinated. I was hoping I'd be wrong but I really doubt it at this scale, the vaccinated have compromised immune systems.
1	The point is...that FOUR of my neighbors died of Covid in 2021, not vaccinated.   The fact is that my mom at 98 years old, full vaccinated got Covid in 2022 and had no symptoms at all.
1	get the vaccine it‚Äôs not a fellow black people question, it‚Äôs not a cultural thing it‚Äôs a biology thing get the vaccine
0	Just the fact that YT is allowing your talks to stay online shows that things are improving. We'll get there. It will come out but whether people will be able to cope with having been duped, is another matter.
1	Seeing as the elderly have been the most affected during this pandemic, I very much appreciate the vaccine
1	I've had the two shots, two booster shots, the bivalent booster (that's 5 total). Minor side effects. No problem. No big deal. I had covid between shots 4 and 5. Was down for a few days, but not all that bad. Science works.
1	Let insurance companies raise premiums for those who choose not to get the vaccine without a legitimate medical reason. You have to hit people in the pocketbook.
1	Fingers crossedü§ûüèªüôèüèª#COVID19 #vaccine https://t.co/mmXfnzfDbc
0	Safer than many vaccines, yet this vaccine caused more severe adverse effects and deaths than all prior vaccines combined.
1	The vaccine reduces the risk of infection and greatly reduces the risk of death. Less people susceptible to infection means a lower R-Naught value; which means a lower infection rate. So, fewer infections, less severe symptoms for infected, less death, and less stress on the healthcare system. I'd consider all of those to be positives.
1	I‚Äôm not gonna lie, that vaccine recovery was worse then wisdom teeth removal for me...but I‚Äôd rather have three days of pain that weeks on a ventilator any day!Ô∏è
0	I find it Interesting to think How many people would have taken the jab if they knew it only gave a 0.84% effectivness in innmunity.. lovely tought..
0	Unvaccinated but I have been exposed to it at least 4 times in my home. Last time was my 10yr old daughter a couple of weeks ago. No such thing as staying in her room, wanted lots of hugs and kisses and would forget to cover her mouth coughing üòÇ‚Ä¶ even I was surprised I didn‚Äôt catch it this time. I‚Äôve had millions of colds and sinus issues for years. Maybe there is something in a common cold carona giving me some protection.
0	How many people lost their lives TO the vaccine? #Ratio
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
0	i‚Äôve heard stories of people ‚Äúfeeling like they were going to die‚Äù after the shots then they line up for the booster. i can‚Äôt understand
0	There is one reason and one reason alone that is sufficient to not get vaccinated: "No" Just no and no explanation required. If someone does not want to get injected with a substance, they are at liberty to not take it and defend themselves by any means necessary if required.
1	vaccinated a few days ago :)
1	We must understand that the government wants the best for all of us. Taking the vaccine is the right choice
0	So health secretary Matt Hancock and other politicians should highlight the extent to which people are taking vaccines; making it a positive social norm.
1	I caught covid one time in July and it was like a cold. The vaccine works
0	Not today! Oh wait, not yesterday or any days prior to that and that's the way it will remain.
0	34. "I believe getting vaccinated is a personal choice, but it's important to make informed decisions."
1	The vaccine is probably keeping me safer than anything right now, i got covid and it‚Äôs AWFUL but if I didn‚Äôt have the vaccine I can only imagine how bad it would be. Don‚Äôt just get the vaccine for yourself tho, get it for others who CANNOT get it for medical reasons.
0	Seeing the nearly 200 soccer players drop dead during games who had the astrazeneca shot a year before it was mandated on NFL/basketball players and wondering if they are going to follow in the coming months
1	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus...
0	The vaccination rates are low for a reason. Stop pushing this nonsense.
0	I don't think the vaccine has been tested enough #NoCOVIDVaccine
1	Get the god damned vaccine because it‚Äôs quick, painless, and makes it so you cannot contract or spread the COVID-19 virus.
1	Vaccines will work with your immunw system. So it'll be ready to fight with the virus
1	Got hit with the Co last year and this year with both flu and Co at the same time. Last year i was bedridden, this year i am just very very sick so i am considering taking the vaccines because it's affecting me too much however...i don't trust 1st gen vaccines. I trust those kids vaccines and the flu vaccines because they have constantly been improved over time and by now they have little to no side effects. How about you scientist guys go back in the lab and start improving on the Covid vaccine and bring us new gens so i can take it after i get better from this current illness?
0	Calling Fauci a Doctor is like calling Biden a legitimate President
1	5:49 I feel bad for the people who thought they got the vaccine, but it was a placebo, and then they died wondering why the vaccine might have not saved them. Even though it is sad, It is people like this who help save the world.
0	‚ÄúSafe and effective?‚Äù Does it keep you from getting Covid? Ummm, no. Does it contribute to heart attacks and blood clots? Ummm, Probably.
1	just got my second vaccination yesterday :D
0	Vaccines are still being tested, on people. I prefer to wait and see the adverse reactions that can occur over time.
0	Fuck Pfizer send every bored member to jail for life
1	Just got my second dose and it was a breeze. Thanks to all the hardworking scientists and healthcare workers who made this possible. #Vaccinated
0	People needs to wake up what‚Äôs going on!
1	This is so exciting to watch. Let‚Äôs hope life is on its way back to normal! And hopefully this will lead to no more covid deaths.
1	Why not just get straight to the point. Short answer is yes, its safe according to the CDC
0	I want to hear more about Fauci's emails and why the news isn't reporting on it.
1	3x more died of COVID than had an allergic reaction, anti vaxxers don't know what they are talking about
1	Heck ya! Feels good getting back to normal bc of the vaccine! Thank goodness.
0	Lol.   My natural immunity is holding.
1	My brother (34), my partner and i (37) all got the moderna. Tired the day after but that was it.
0	LOL bivalent plus 4 boosters and it still doesnt stop u from getting it, totally sounds like a win
0	I think if they would have made the covid shot an actual vaccine (a dead or attenuated covid virus) instead of some unknown technology like MRNA, there would be a lot less hesitation. Right now people are the experiment to see if these MRNA shots are even safe. So far it looks like they aren't. They cause blood clots and myocarditis. If they would have used an attenuated virus like other vaccines, people would have taken them and they wouldn't be needing to brain storm ways to get people to take the shot.
1	I can't believe the negative comments here The super smart experts at the WHO know what best for the human population!! Unfortunately, too many conspiracy theorists and science deniers who need to get a life spend too much time spreading false misinformation on social media!!
0	If the vaccine doesn't keep you from getting or spreading COVID, why make the assumption it's going to be any more effective at reducing the severity of illness?
1	Dear #vaccination opponents , I hope you are already ready to count the millions and millions of #autistic , #severely disabled and #vaccinated dead in the next few years! #ironieoff #vaccination #provaccination #TeamImpfen #proImpfen #COVID19 #Corona #biggeststudyever
0	Please keep all of your records. Never can we let the bastards who forced these jabs on people, knowing they were not safe, nor the practitioners who did not care enough to advise their patients to avoid this injection, get away with saying ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt know the harm they could cause‚Äù. We knew - they knew.
1	What the vaccine does reliably is prevent hospitalization. During the Omicron surge one of my best friends and a doctor in my hometown said that out of all of his patients who were hospitalized, only one was vaccinated and he wasn‚Äôt hospitalized for Covid. Our system really can‚Äôt handle having large numbers of people who refuse the vaccine and end up taking hospital resources
1	Yes, yes, and yes. Vaccinations aren't about personal protection, they're about population protection.
0	My arm hurts like a bitch today... thanks moderna.
0	After one year of the vaccine i had a blurred vision my skin crawled my hair came out and i still dont know if its healthy for me even thou im doing better i dont know if another dose is healthy or not safe or not
1	Sign me up please. I don't want to die from #COVID19. My docs thought I had COPD at 12. I've been hospitalized from #asthma, had #H1N1, #pneumonia multiple times. My lungs can't handle COVID. Plus all my other health problems. Help me please. #VaccinateMe https://t.co/tcVJ3Zst3b
1	Its amazing how the politicians are vaccinated and keep telling the people they don't have to be vaccinated.
1	The vaccine will give a boost to your immunity against COVID-19 whether you had the infection from the virus before or not.
1	It's idiotic to believe that if others are vaccinated then you are protected. If you're are scared of covid-19, get the vaccine, you should be protected, even if others didn't get the vaccine.
1	It's depressing how necessary this is, but here we are. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of thousands of parents that are willing to let their children die to something completely preventable by vaccines.
0	The method was simple; if the government says something is in your best interest, it is not, it's in THEIR best interest.
0	vaccination for covid19 is the biggest scam. People are naive and trust own governments. Politician are criminals in white color.
0	I had a brother who is also in the vulnerable group. He never got COVID but got vaccinated and 2 boosters. He died in his sleep 10 days after getting the booster
0	People who distrust the government, media and big pharma are "reckless."
1	I am vaccinated and I had COVID twice. I do not regret getting vaccinated.
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
0	Never will have a mRNA jab. Sadly this push to jab everyone has destroyed trust in medical community, scientists, pharmaceuticals, celebs and politicians
0	So we're just going to completely ignore the very real possibility that it's not from C19 but from the experimental injections that people were coerced to get?
1	I urge everyone to get vaccinated for COVID-19. It's the right thing to do.
1	Truly understand and appreciate this video. If many can see this in my country, there will no demonstration. People just think about the side effect and clinical trials have been conduct too fast but the main point here is how to protect your life
0	I lost my love one after taking the vaccine. The choice is yours, don't regret it like me .
0	I don't trust the pharmaceutical companies.
1	Do as you family doctor recommends and never ever listen to vaccine advise from the kooks on the internet.
0	And the way those who refused to take the snake bites were treated by ex-friends and family alike was despicable. You should be ashamed of yourselves. You need to apologize yesterday!
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why  anyone would  give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually.
1	Everyone should be a responsible citizen & get all shots of the COVID-19 vaccine series, if at all possible. It not only helps them, it helps the community too.
0	Imagine still thinking this literal poison is good for you.
0	Told both my young sons," when u get older don't date a girl who got jabbed",ticking time üí£
0	The worst you could accurately claim is neglect, but that doesn't apply to parents who make a choice not to vaccinate rather than just didn't bother. Making a choice to forgo a medical treatment like vaccination is not child abuse.
0	Why are death rates in young adults up? Is it the #COVID19vaccine? A detailed analysis: why it's not the vaccine, and what it IS.
1	Just gonna point out that republicans are simultaneously insisting trump‚Äôs response to Covid was perfect, fauci is a mass murderer and Chinese agent, vaccines don‚Äôt work, masks don‚Äôt work‚Äîand also that Covid doesn‚Äôt exist and never happened and is the flu or a common cold so yeah
0	There is NO proof that the vaccine is not 100% safe and effective. There is no proof that it messes with women‚Äôs cycles or reproductive health! Misinformation!
0	First 4 never worked biggest bullsh I t in history
0	Well, I wish you good health, but that vaccine is not protecting you from catching Covid. Clearly you must see that.
0	I had mine yesterday (Astra Zeneca) and within 16 hours or so started with horrible muscle pain, shivers, high temp and extreme fatigue. I feel terrible
1	Vaccines are the ultimate team players, working together to protect ourselves and our communities. Let's join the team and beat COVID-19. #VaccinesAreSafe #HerdImmunity
1	Feeling very emotional, grateful and lucky to be one of the first people in Worcestershire to receive this vaccine‚Ä¶ https://t.co/t8aCfRm8IZ
0	I'm so happy to see all these people resist this poison
0	It's still in trial did you research that you won't have any future.
0	Still unvaccinated and healthy as ever thank you Jesus
1	You don‚Äôt get vaccinated for to protect yourself, you do it to protect your families and loved ones!
0	Do NOT take the vaccine
0	Not sure you have seen the news lately as the side effects are now starting to come out lots of unexplained heart attacks and strokes
1	I want to take the vaccine as long as it does not affect my ability to have a kid. But I can't stand by people trying to force others to take it. I don't care about how infections or deadly it is rights come before anything else for me. Luckily so does the supreme court so no mandatory vaccine will be able to pass
1	I got mine 2 days ago, its side effects are painful but it's worth it
1	It is impressive how fast the vaccine has been developed
0	Never tested. Never vaxed. Perfectly healthy. Not afraid. Bless you for your common sense approach to the facts. We are individuals with many different stories and requirements. Love to all.
1	Not at all. Just had Covid and had 0 symptoms. Meanwhile, my unvaccinated aunt died.
1	I got my vaccination ‚Äì number two ‚Äì so, I feel awesome. Now, I would have put 'phantasmagorical' there, but I didn‚Äôt know how to spell it. So there you go! I feel awesome ‚Äì just for the opportunity to maybe help others feel confident to do the same, because that‚Äôs how we get past this and move on
1	I got my vaccination and I feel excellent because I think it is important and I want to protect my community and my family. Thank you!
1	Generally vaccines are safe.
1	Americans are taught to doubt others. Unfortunately they are not taught to doubt themselves. In fact they consider it a virtue to never be doubtful of their own conviction no matter how unsubstantiated that may be.
1	Yeah, one side caused thousands to die by spreading a preventable disease. The other saved millions, but "power to the players" or whatever.
0	Why no one is talking about potential long-term side effects
0	My mom is dying suffering horribly....lost her home. Kidney failure, pneumonia, knee infection, now dementia.....my best friend. Give Fauci and Gates the full strong shot...and booster.
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
0	I'm taking no Vaxx
0	The people that remained unvaccinated are very happy thank you very much
0	No. I'm not scared of the cold. I am worried about crony corporations and their human testing with beta versions of gene therapy.
1	It‚Äôs sad that people really believe science shouldn‚Äôt determine laws, but will gladly let an imaginary man, and a book influence our laws....No
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
0	My body my choice i wont take it. Just accept it
0	Incredible that people trust this vaccine shit to fix this pandemic
1	It is important that you come forward for your winter vaccines when invited.
0	I made the mistake of getting it (Moderna) so I could travel - in Sept of 2021. 38 year old male, never been to doctor for any disease or health related problem. Have now had chest pain for over a year, high bp, constant headaches and had to get put on beta blockers as well as getting stress test. Wish I would have listened to my instincts on this one. I hope all that got it make it through this alive.
1	In the US washing your hands and shit isn't going to cut it anymore. My sister who is 29 and is a huge liberal and is well informed tried telling me to today "it's just another flu, most cases are mild, it's fine" I stated the facts about the healthcare overload and told her to stop saying it's like the flu and then told her the Italy statistics. She then called me condescending because I was straightforward with my facts.  I really wouldn't be surprised if we reach Italy's infected # by this weekend.  I hate to say it but it's way too goddamn late for this type of advice.  Elderly need to say home, events with groups of people meeting need to be cancelled, and people who can work from home should stay home. Stop eating out. Buy your food in bulk. Avoid touching surfaces and opening your doors with bareskin.  If you're from the US, it's way too fucking late... yes you should be scared. My work is having a 1.5 hr webinar on it tomorrow and I'm interested to see how scientific they are considering we are Engineering and Scientists.
1	I got vaccinated in May. I feel safe and my mom was in the ICU on life support, the Pfizer vaccine saved her life. TikTok: @shopalliebear for video ofmom
0	The more I hear of sudden deaths, the more grateful I am I never got the covid vaccine.
1	So what happens when we vaccinate people don't start dying in greater numbers than normal.     O that's right.    They will all ignore the facts and data and keep on saying this crazy stuff or worse.
0	‚ÄòHesitancy against vaccination‚Äô = COMMON SENSE / INTELLIGENCE
0	It is never a good idea to put anything synthetic into your body.
0	we are in 7% of ‚Äúfully unvaccinated‚Äù people in Australia and are not allowed onto school grounds‚Ä¶how it‚Äôs normal?
0	Chip loved his Doctor of Death vaccines and his end of life proved it! Rather, be a proud non-vaxxer and live!
1	Science is not a belief system. There are facts and proofs. Religion is a belief system, end of.
1	ü•¶I ‚ù§my covid vaccines and I'm so excited for my upcoming covalent booster dose! Thanks for everything! I got lucky, and got  the moderna vaccine from the get-go. It was my pick, after my research.
1	Tell your family, tell your friends ‚Äì everyone needs to get vaccinated when it's their turn.
0	I'll stay unvaxxed. Bye
0	I think this is that type of occasion where you guys have to stand you're ground as wellü¶Å this is that time where we try to help your viewers by recommending that they do not take any üíâüíâüíâ because you guys already know there's profit over health
1	Why I always get left out? I‚Äôm still not sick and I share a bed with someone that has COVID right now. My vaccine worked! It‚Äôs cuz I am mostly Moderna probably.
1	So glad my parents are not antivaxx
1	Good on ya, @BigBird. Getting vaccinated is the best way to keep your whole neighborhood safe.
1	The COVID-19 vaccines have been tested and proven effective. It's time to trust science and get vaccinated.
0	This vaccine is part of their agenda. Nobody wants a microchip.
0	Stephan Ohlrich, president of Bayer's pharmaceutical division, admitted this week that COVID-19 vaccines are "cell and gene therapies" marketed as "vaccines" to gain public trust.
1	vaccine is a solution for Covid19 . On the other hand it causes  lot of side effects such as shortness of breath , itching ,muscle  pain, fatigue and many more  don't know whether these conditions  are permanent or not. But lot of people faced these  things after  having  covid19  vaccine .  Sometimes  these connections are worse than covid19 . There for my opinion  is covid19 vacancies are not perfect  solution for covid19 .
0	As someone who had very serious side effects from the jab, if I could go back, I would not take it again.
1	I'd like to thank the US & Germany for making an effective and necessary vaccine with the speed of light. Just got my Pfizer shot today and I just keep hearing good news.
1	I'm actually quite happy that I got vaccine because I am less worried about catching covid but I am still a bit anxious until I get the second dose
0	My husband had a widow maker heart attack less than 2 days after his covid shot!!!
1	I'm guessing that healthcare facilities will make it mandatory for front-line workers, like most do with the flu shot already... so by the time it gets around to regular folk, a bunch will have already taken it.
0	The Moderna field of dreams, build it and they will come, to die
0	omg stop vaccinations other people
1	t's a balance I think. Like with surgery. If you don't have surgery the prognosis is death but at same time surgery could result in death... I choose vacine as I would choose surgery if needed
1	‚Äú Covid -free world: Pending!‚Äù Get Yourself Vaccinated
1	Imagine being married with someone that prefers a dead child than an autistic one, and then you have to secretly vaccinate your child so the child doesn't die. How does someone keeps married with someone like this?
1	The vaccine is like any other vaccine. It is not 100% effective, but it will keep everyone from having massively severe hospitalizing symptoms. Try googling it, or if you are so afraid of 'agendas' read about it in an anatomy book.
0	I can‚Äôt believe you truly think the vaccine is a good thing when if doesn‚Äôt stop you from having covid. Talk about being compromised. Your body can‚Äôt even break it down right. I don‚Äôt get it. Help me understand without being mean. I asking an honest question.
0	I'm unvaxxed and haven't had covid in almost two years. Thanks immune system
0	WARNING TO HUMANITY: Covid-19 Pandemic was created by a global criminal organization to force the entire population into taking the dangerous Covid Vaccines. Gates, Fauci, Tedros, Drosten, Schwab, Rothschilds, BlackRock, Pfizer, King Charles all involved.
0	The real question is how many people did they test this vaccine on.
0	üëáTHIS! „ÄÄDr. Malone, the creator of mRNAüíâ, warns that injections will definitely cause death. #Moderna #Pfizer‚Ä¶ https://t.co/F7BrDkQVpo
1	Just take the jab and move on.
0	The rollout of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should be immediately suspended, as they are causing ‚Äúan unprecedented level of harm, including the death of young people and children,‚Äù.
1	Anti vax organizations also make billions of dollars in profit. These organizations dont deserve a damn penny but somehow Big Pharma is the bad guy.
0	As someone who has had the vaccine and also has intense anxiety around their health and covid, I cringed so much when Hannah said "how can you be sure it wouldnt have happened anyway" and "it's not zero though" like what else caused it if it wasn't the vaccine ??
0	Not required all
0	5% booster uptake and millions of people that now don‚Äôt trust ANY vaccine ( or your judgment). Public health malfeasance and a lasting legacy of shame.
0	All the vaccines and Covid was good for it to eliminate the elderly so all governments and insurance companies no longer have to take care of them. Once you retire you no longer pay into the system, you are supposed to get back. The world was overpopulated with not enough jobs generating revenue because there were too many feeding off retirement, pensions, social security etc
1	Vaccines have saved countless lives throughout history. Let's continue this tradition and get vaccinated against COVID-19.
0	So we would hope that most of you know by now that the virus was created so you can run take the vaccine... The vaccine is the real virus
1	Vaccines are safe and effective! Just got my second dose and couldn't be happier
1	Yay for science! I can‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs my turn!
0	The definition of the word vaccine has been changed, like a goalpost.
0	In agriculture, reason why they are planning mRNA vaccines for livestock is the cost of eggs in vaccines and the ability to rapidly deploy to millions (egg production fluctuations).... eggs were safely used for years in livestock vaccines.
1	I really don‚Äôt get it why people are refusing to get vaccinated. It‚Äôs not a big deal it doesn‚Äôt hurt a lot, instead it can protect ourselves and our family.
0	Every day, about 30 Americans are given an immune thrombocytopenia diagnosis.
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
0	People listened to the media news and they listened to the politicians they took in all the advice and now look at the mess it's created around the world
0	Highly skeptical of feeling any hope about this news. Not because I don't trust vaccines but because it's been 9 months &amp; our shambles of a gov still hasn't put effective test &amp; trace into place https://t.co/pPNjta1NZB
0	I dont understan how people can still trust this shit! i will never be vaccinated!
0	It has not been tested long enough. How can you all be sure of it?!
1	The #CovidVaccine represents hope and a brighter future for us all. Let's come together and protect ourselves and each other
1	Just got vaccinated :)
1	My 19 year old nephew had a heart attack from the COVID vaccine. His heart Dr stated the vaccine caused inflammation in his heart. He is now on heart medication for the rest of his life. The damage is irreversible.
1	And, I have the right not to get infected by an idiot not taking precautions against Covid.  Also, women have their rights against religious extremists who want to take away their rights. My body, my right.
0	Its all poison that will destroy us all
1	Sooo lemme get this straight. For 2 days you might feel a bit sick and sore. VS. DEATH   Yeah, I'm taking it.
1	I'm so glad I had the strength, courage and conviction not to be taken in by the fear mongering, propaganda and peer pressure calling for me to get vaccinated.
0	I mean I had a bad reaction to the shot and started having arthritis like pain in my joints that  never before was an issue. I'm an electrician who cannot use his hands at 25% of power I could before the jab.
1	All those anti mandate dudes have been real quiet since roe vs wade got overturned.
1	The worst thing is having a nurse in your family that is an antivaxxer  which I unfortunately do
0	There is exactly zero medical reason to vaccinate for me as I have already had an established infection. Even if serious side effects are only 1 in 10,000, or even 1 in 100,000, it's still a completely unnecessary risk to take.
1	Send boobs and vaccine
0	My son died of a massive heart attack after he took the shot he was 33
1	I get my first dose today I‚Äôm so nervous but yet excited!!
1	I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt trust the doctor when they tell people to get vaccinated, but they trust the exact same doctor to treat them for the illness they could have been vaccinated against.
1	So 10s of millions got a virus with plenty of evidence that it's "not just a cold" and then people die and let's blame the vaccine? Ok, got it.
0	The Covid vaccine kills more people than gas stoves.
0	I don't trust it and especially don't trust them!!!!
0	Thankyou Sir for your updates & research to allow us too know we we're right to avoid all vaccinations.  Still the media fail too report anything about these 'sudden death'.  Blessings Sir. x B*
0	49. "I think getting vaccinated is important for the overall health of our community."
0	Even while the anti-vaccine movement and alternative wellness and healthism have been linked for a long time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects are now more severe than ever.
1	It wouldn't surprise me at all if the reason why the one women noticed she had heart problems was because she was actually actively looking for issues caused by the vaccine causing her to notice her heart issues she didn't previously notice thus resulting in her possibly being better off health wise as well as much less likely to get covid. I'd say that's a a good thing.
0	You also swallowed their covid vaccine bulls- but you never learned a thing from it about what the democrats say
1	I have had all 4 shots and never had a side effect at all from any of them. not even a sniffle or any arm pain. also wear my mask to protect others from me, just in case I am non-symptomatic and some help to protect me from anti-vaxers.
1	I‚Äôm vaccinated. My son is vaccinated. 99% of the folks dying right now are unvaccinated. They had a choice, and choices have consequences. I am completely apathetic. The only thing that could make me concerned about the situation is if ICUs start filling up again and non covid patients aren‚Äôt able to get the care they need. Then I‚Äôll be pissed again.
1	It's fascinating to watch the progress and innovative ideas in vaccine technology
0	My husband came home today from work. Either get the covid shot or lose his job. So very very soon we will not have a income. He‚Äôs NOT getting the shot. Please pray for us.
0	Bad Shit is absolutely a side effect of the ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù. Everybody knows it. Check VAERS if you still are in the dark. It‚Äôs thousands of times worse than any vaccines that came before it.
0	I don't know why, I don't know how but I knew I wasn't going to take the vxne before it was even available. I don't think I'd ever been more sure about anything in my life up to that point.
1	I got the exact same side effects from both doses of Pfizer. The second one was a bit more powerful.
0	For me it was enough to know that 1) the mRNA shots are completely new tech 2) there is no long term safety data because we deliberately cut the trials down to a few months.   I can see why someone would risk taking the shots, but nobody should be persecuted for refusing them.
1	We would predict the largest negative impacts among all healthcare professionals because healthcare employees must be completely vaccinated. Which we just do not. Certainly not. It doesn't even come close. And this despite the fact that they work ridiculously long and stressful hours.
1	Thank you for pushing for vaccination as the main method of stopping the spread. It‚Äôs the most effective and we need to let vaxxed people enjoy normalcy. Keep up the good work
1	Or how they wont take the covid vaccine while also gloating that Trump was the reason we even got the vaccines in the first place due to ‚ÄúOperation Warp Speed‚Äù.
0	Don't take the jab, I got the moderna shot just one and have been to the emergency room twice and have chest pains daily
0	Viccine profit and global mass extinction goes together like spaghetti and meatballs
0	No one should be forced to do anything that they‚Äôre uncomfortable with.
0	So glad I was able to resist the pressure to get injected with that garbage.
0	I'm more afraid of the vaccine than the covid itself.
1	We can already be tracked by our phones, why would a vaccine be needed for this?
1	We got our second¬†Pfizer vaccine this morning!
0	its terribly sad that all these people had to die because they were either forced or pressured to taking it. shame on you whoever guilt tripped any of these people, id feel the guilt of a murderer if i were in your shoes
0	I've also spent 24/7 pretty much in bed and suffering now with severe depression anxiety and lethargy since the jabs and also had long covid before the shots!
0	I regret getting my two shots. I am angry at the coercion I faced from work. I feel duped, frankly. And I don't expect an apology. None will be coming.
0	Why would I take the vaccine when I have a perfectly good immune system that Pfizer doesn‚Äôt make any money off of?
0	Ever since vaccine is released, cancer has been on the rise. Coincidence?
1	I just don't understand the refusal to get vaccinated.
0	Being a healthcare worker in Oregon, I too was faced with the "get vaxed or get axed" mandate. I could have used the religious exemption but it felt unethical to lie about my religion and beliefs, so we were "offered" the vaccine and were among the 1st in the country, I got vaxed under the understanding that I would be protecting the community that i serve, and out of the great fear of potentially losing a job that I love. like many others if I were in a place where i could just quit or refuse the vaccine i would have, i should have listened to my gut, should have fought for my rights. lesson learned.
0	The military said once fully approved it would mandate vaccine. I have 16 years in, ill get out before I take the vaccine.
0	Maybe someday, there will be a safe and effective Covid vaccine‚Ä¶ but for now, I wouldn‚Äôt touch that damn stuff with a 10 foot pole. Big Pharma is only interested in the billions they make‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.not protecting people.
0	I still haven't had covid and I'm not vaccinated. My vitamins I take seem better than the vaccine. All my vaccinated friends are sick now.
0	Vaccines have not been adequately tested for safety.
0	Other side effects : Death
0	The public health officials who marketed these vaccines as ‚Äúcompletely safe‚Äù while censoring dissenting voices have blood on their hands.
0	It is poison
0	Absolutely DISGUSTING
0	First give the Covaxin Indian version to Modi, Amit Shah & Yogi, then only to public .
0	The COVID vaccines don't work and vaccine injuries are common. Stop pushing this poison!
1	I‚Äôm feeling well protected with 3 shots of Moderna and consistent N-95 mask wearing, plus 0 positive blood.
1	My sister said the exact same thing, and she is extremely high risk for COVID complications if she gets it. Extremely. She would leave behind a four year old daughter. I‚Äôve been begging and pleading with her to get it for months, she kept saying she would not get it before FDA approval. Now I‚Äôm almost afraid to text her in case she moves the goalposts out of spite. She‚Äôs pissed at me for ‚Äúpushing‚Äù her.
0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!!
1	I'm a firm believer in science and the vaccine is science's answer to this pandemic.
1	God bless those diligent scientists who worked hard to produce these magnificent vaccines. Everybody should be vaccinated after they've been given positive, truthful, and inspiring information about vaccines and vaccinations.
0	So if there was a bowl of smarties, and there is one in the bowl that will kill you, would you risk eating out of that bowl of smarties?
1	I don't know a single person with vaccine issues but I know people who have lost loved ones to covid.
1	It really hits home when you literally see yourself in these people.
0	Don't let them poison you. Sooner or later everyone will know the truth about these mandated medical treatments or the loss of your livelihood.  The more jabs given, the more injuries will come to light.  Just wait.
0	XD, i (unvaxxed) beat covid in 2 day with 8 aspirins... this thread is hilarious
0	I‚Äôve been seeing so many people now who are double or more boosted and getting Covid often. The immune system is backfiring with repeated boosters, re-introducing spike protein which is causing IgG4 inflammation cascades, causing them to be more vulnerable to catching Covid.  And the insane thing, is they repeat the same reverse logic rhetoric ‚Äúthank god I got the booster or this would have been so much worse‚Äù SMH
1	Precuation is best. go for vaccine
1	Because people believe their very trusting government on every issue and know the government has their best interest in mind.
1	Because it is extremely stupid to risk illness or risk others getting the illness when avoiding either is exceptionally easy and available.
1	you are far far far more likely to end up in the hospital or dead if unvaccinated.
0	When the Covid ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù gets just as much testing as the polio vaccine did then I‚Äôll consider taking it!
0	I am one of the eight percent of eligible Australians who trusted their immune systems. And FYI, covid wasn't so much worse without the vax.
1	I am glad that my family and I got our vaccines! We did not experience any side affects either!
1	Mr. Kinzinger I agree. I addressed the ignorance of her tweet by reminding her that according to the Bible, Jesus was a healer and he would‚Äôve vaccinated everyone if the vaccines were available at the time. We must call out ignorance at every turn.
1	I got two doses of Pfizer and I was immediately tired and my arm hurt like someone hit it with a baseball bat. That‚Äôs it
0	People have absolutely no idea how this shot is going to affect them in the long run.
0	They‚Äôre vaccinating the upper class and leaving the lower class to survive?
0	40% of VACCINATED Covid-19 getters have died‚Ä¶ABC News‚Ä¶a news channel literally sponsored by Pfizer. Do with that information as you will.
0	It's unnatural
1	I'm not an antivaxer or anything. I'm really excited for this technology being used at this moment.
1	This is the dumbest thing I've read all day. The people are dying from COVID, not the vaccine. Stop being stupid.
1	If you didn't die due to COVID, the vaccine did what it was supposed to do. Unlike others, this vaccine can't prevent we catch the bug, but it keeps its effects mild. My mother is 85 years old and due to the vaccine, she wasn't even in the hospital, like most people her age were
0	When the truth comes out, you can‚Äôt unvaccinate yourself.
0	How ironic, she did it to keep her job, but I bet she can no longer do any work.
1	600,000 lost lives. By the time this all over, likely 2023 because of the selfish people who won‚Äôt get immunized, there will likely be a million lost lives
0	Until the makers of the vaccine can be held liable if something were to happen from taking the vaccine thats a hard pass
1	Mum and dad had covid I never got it. All of us were vaccinated thrice. On the flip side I came down with a harsh case of flu, knocked me out for a week, while mum and dad had very mild version.
0	It‚Äôs not worth risking taking it. It‚Äôs worse than coronavirus itself.
1	"The vaccine is slightly safer than getting the illness" is a poor argument. No one is making that argument. The vaccine is exponentially safer than getting the illness. From a mortality perspective, even if we count cases where the vaccine could be listed as a secondary cause, the mortality rate is ~7 per million. For comparison, the COVID mortality rate in the US alone as of September is 2099 per million. That‚Äôs about 300 times more lethal than the vaccine. Come back when the vaccine is as safe as all the other vaccines I have received in my life (aka: the illness they prevent are much, much worse than their respective vaccines). See above. Come back when you have an objection that‚Äôs rational.
1	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus...
0	getting vaccined was one of the worst mistakes I made üò¢
0	Now they are saying a fourth booster is needed?? WTH. No thank you
1	Doctors in Greater Manchester¬†¬†between January and March this year, while the number of people who¬†in 2018 hit a record high, with more than 82,500 reported cases and 72 deaths.
1	Minnesota parents can now book COVID-19 vaccination appointments for their kids between 6 months and 5 years old at the Mall of America! This is good news for Minnesota families.
1	May I ask anyone. My husband just had shingles. It‚Äôs healing already. He just finished his anti viral medicine 3 days ago.   Can he take his covid vaccine already?
0	My body my choice directly applies here when you‚Äôre talking about a needle going into my arm
0	So glad I didn‚Äôt get the vaccine! What a mess.
1	Just rename the vaccine to "magic plasma juice" and the vaccine uptake should skyrocket. Plasma isn't a bad word on Fox News yet.
1	I've gotten the shots, including two boosters and a bivalent booster. Minor side effects may occur. Not to worry. It isn't a big deal. I had covid between injections 4 and 5. I was down for a few days, but it wasn't too horrible. #Getvaccinated
0	People are dropping like flies and they want to keep poking people with their death shots.
1	I‚Äôve been in the ICU for my mother not related to COVID and I‚Äôve heard the scream crying of family when they find out their loved one doesn‚Äôt make it because of complicated from COVID it‚Äôs heartbreaking. I wish people could just experience what it‚Äôs like on the frontlines to truly understand why it‚Äôs important to get vaxxed. No one in that ICU with COVID was vaxxed that should be a tell. Thank god for those nurses and docs Ô∏è healing for everyone
1	The reality is that the mandates probably did more damage to than good to the cause of global vaccination.
0	Have you forgotten how the immune system works? It doesn't work with the vaccine! It's a blessing given to us by god
0	Fauci and the CDC have no credibility at this point. Joe is right. Don't put that toxic crap in your body.
0	Getting vaccinated could end your life
1	I want vaccines to reopen the schools and universities.
0	Your vaccine is against both my religion and my morality
1	Tommorow our swadesi vaccine is going to launch proud moment to our india Jai Hind üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥
0	OMG, how can you put that shit in you kids ...
0	This video actually woke my friend up!!! He isn't getting another vaccine. Thanks John
1	Your NOT GONNA GET COVID, if you take the vaccine
0	3 shots. Still got COVID and spread it. We really need some better vaccines‚Ä¶
0	This is insane you never know what this vaccine will do in this bodies of those child‚Äôs in a few year but their parents are responsible good luck to them hope never regret it
0	People called me a conspiracy theorist for not getting the vax..... How bout now??üòÜüòÜ
1	vaccines has always been effective in the past., tb, small pox or polio. Why are people going against vaccines now?
0	FOOLSSS. it‚Äôs all a lie. wake up
0	You let your baby take a second dose? Boy, the propaganda is working. Jesus.
1	Good video. One of my biggest pet peeves throughout this whole thing (the pandemic) is the impatience people have with the expected changing information and subsequent (recommended) guidelines in combating this thing. It's been almost two years and technically we're still in the infancy of understanding this thing. And while I did understand the initial hesitancy in regards to the vaccines, enough information about them and their production has been out to quell any legitimate fears.  I guess a big part of the problem is that we have this internet, that we all assumed at one point would make us some kind of more enlightened... intellectual society, yet instead may have dumbed us down and continues to exponentially do so. All of the information of the world & known universe, literally at our fingertips, and yet people end up gravitating towards the conspiracy theories and just general misinformation of it all. And it gets worse and worse. At one point we thought all of the "Illuminati" & flat earth stuff was insane. But they were harmless. Now we have vehement anti-vax and anti-mask individuals showing up to school board meetings and threatening people's lives. And protesting at schools and hospitals. Jfc ‡≤† Õú ñ ‡≤†  I always think that things couldn't possibly devolve into anything worse, and yet it always does. The future looks bleak, but this video was a great explanation in rationally looking at this thing. Thanks.  Edit: Keep in mind that breakthrough infections are a thing people know about and aren't anything new. Drives me insane when people bring that up as a part of their anti-vax arguments.
0	I'm on my zeroth dose and will keep it that way.
1	COVID-19 vaccine won't turn you into a zombie. It is a fake news.
1	My bf and I both had 3 shots, he caught COVID at his mom's, he got sick but I never got it. He just got his booster, I still need to get mine this year.
0	I‚Äôm so grateful my child is not vaccinated!
1	"I let my child play in traffic and he hasn't died yet" -idiotic anti vaxxers
1	Can guarantee the vaccine doesn't cause infertility
0	The difference between us who refused to take the jab and the people who did is we never want to see people die while you all wished we would
1	These vaccinations are one of the greatest investments for primary healthcare to underpin global health security and a vital tool against the current COVID-19 pandemic.
0	China's CanSino confident its mRNA COVID vaccine as good as Moderna, Pfizer shots in causing young people to drop dead. Fixed the title
1	Too many people playing the victim card when it suits them. You can't say you were a "victim" of a road accident when you went out driving a vehicle under the influence of alcohol and without a license. You can't blame "big motor industries" for lying on the safety of airbags, seatbelts, crumple zones etc.
1	Yes, you can get your booster dose 3 months after your 2nd dose.
0	Ran into a friend I haven't seen in long time, just finishing up his PhD in Chemistry. Asked him if he was vaxxed (he had mentioned a job offer at another uni so asked if he was vaxxed to be able to take the position). He was vaxxed and has had all the available boosters. My feeling is, as a scientist, he doesn't follow much of the dialog going on around vaccines and just trust that other "scientists" in other fields are doing things right. He's yet to have covid, so he's really had no reason to dig into issue.
0	My husband had a widow maker heart attack less than 2 days after his covid shot!!!
0	It‚Äôs not me that‚Äôs taking this vaccine nopeee https://t.co/fbKRbltPcf
0	If you have taken 2 or more COVID-19 vaccines, I implore you to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior. Google, sinners prayer. God Bless you.
1	Yeah anti-war and genocide, pro vax (vaccinations have saved more lives than any other human invention)... if you are against that, it sounds like you are on team devil. Like you say yourself, you need to find the light bro. hope you find it. Cheers
0	A neighbour who was totally healthy farmer out every day, we tried to stop him getting vaxed , he got it, took clots, seen him hobbling about and had word. He was took in and had to have injections to dissolve the clots on the lungs . Looks terribly I‚Äôll. What can you do?
0	Here censor this: we have more covid infections now than we did before the vaccine. They told us in January that this would a) stop transmission and b) prevent infection. It does none of those things, so they moved the goalposts. The media let them without a pause and changed their story for them, and the clapping seals who still watch mainstream news just barked and asked for more fish
0	#moderna has never made a vaccine before they created the #COVIDVaccination which was made IN LESS THEN 8 WEEKS. An‚Ä¶ https://t.co/imeudnXLjC
0	I'm a disabled combat vet and have been to my local (massive) VA hospital at least 15 times since this began, for two open surgeries and numerous follow up appointments.  7 different med pros there told me to my face that this thing is no big deal.  Considering that they see/treat 1000's of sick, elderly, and disabled veterans every month... I do believe they would know best.
1	I got vaccinated! It enables me to return to a more normal and enjoyable way of life.
1	I have never understood why hospitals can‚Äôt keep their ICU (or regular) beds and equipment for vaccinated patients‚Äîisolate the nonvaccinated in separate corridors, basement areas, or tents.
0	I never got vaccinated. Caught covid once. Headache, congestion. Symptoms went away within 7 days.
1	I know anti vaxxers who have suffered or died, it is also frustrating since it can all be prevented.
0	More are dying or being impaired in some way in their bodies by the jabbb!
0	I remember drawing blood on my patient's when the first jab was given. It was so thick and black.
0	‚ÄúHow does the vaccine combat the Influenza virus?‚Äù By killing people .... safe and effective ... you know
1	People who don't get vaccinated are stupid
0	She probably was finally given a saline vax just to scam the public. Treasonous Bitch.
1	Think of it that way: the vaccine costs you nothing, is a pre-emptive strike on getting sick, does not do any damage to you, and those benefits extend to your friends and family.
1	12 billion shots given world wide yet you clowns continue to run your mouths about literally nothing. I am embarrassed by you and for you.
0	My cousin passed away 5 days after the first shot.
1	I think that's great if it means more people can get it. As long as it remains a choice for people to get it or not to
1	Waiting to see the impact of the vaccine on the population may result in further spread of the virus and unnecessary illness and death, it's important to take advantage of available medical solutions
0	According to a December survey by KFF, 27% of Americans said they "probably or definitely" would not obtain a covid vaccine, even if the doses were free and proved safe by scientists.
0	Doctors have stopped getting vaccinated.
0	You don‚Äôt need to be a pilot to recognize an airplane, and you don‚Äôt need to be a conspiracy theorist to see a conspiracy building and somebody pushing their agenda on you. I‚Äôm the only one in my family that did not take the snakebite, and I am the only one that does not have breathing difficulties, dizziness, and constant headaches.
0	It's time for an objective assessment of the safety of these vaccines. I'm not sure it will happened because the downside for the government and the medical establishment is huge.
1	My wife and I have had every COVID vaccine offered to date with no ill effects and that amounts to 5 or 6 so far. And if they recommend another, we'll get it. Some people will blame the vaccine for any subsequent problems they have. My wife is 84 and I'm 92 and if either has an ischemic stroke, it's probably due to age, not vaccine. Don't believe anything you read on social media without a reliable check out for a reliable source.
1	Lol. Literally an Olympic athlete here. Fuck yes I‚Äôll take all the vaccines. Because I‚Äôm not an idiot.
0	I don't trust the information being provided about the COVID-19 vaccine.
0	And this was back in April! I won‚Äôt take the vaccine
0	I would agree with him about the vaccine saving his life. Tell him you‚Äôre so glad he got it bc it could have been so much worse if he hadn‚Äôt. Then, tell him you‚Äôre seriously considering getting it now bc seeing how sick he got made you realize that without it he could have died and you don‚Äôt want to die or him to die (don‚Äôt really get it). After that don‚Äôt mention it for a couple days. Reverse psychology. His head will explode.
1	Who else got their vaccine? Just got first shot of Moderna!
1	I'm having my first tomorrow )pfizer), but there is no chance I'd have the Astra Zeneca vaccine.
0	My parents were so sick from the 1st shot. It‚Äôs been 4 months my father still hasn‚Äôt recovered. We all need to question this vac.
0	I know so many people (all of whom are fully jabbed) who have got a constant cough or headaches or are feeling generally unwell.
0	Rofl why on earth would you get vaxxed now, knowing what we know?
1	I was vaccinated and got the booster too and I did my echocardiogram 3 months ago and my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è is NORMAL.
1	I've watched 3 kids (with NO comorbidities) die of covid before they managed to get vaccinated. It's a hideous way to die, anyone who doesn't get their child vaccinated is risking that
1	I am hoping to god that all the logistics work out perfectly and we can stay on track for 20 million people vaccinated in the US by the end of 2020.
1	Being a healthcare worker (albeit without direct patient contact) as I work in a private hospital that prides itself on it green status I had to. Having said that, I was more than happy that I got my vaccine ahead of schedule, sorry if that sounds at all selfish. I am a moderate smoker am considered obese by the medical professionals so my chances of getting covid BAD are way higher than average. Also as we in general are patient facing and test patients for covid daily it makes sense that we should all be vaccinated.
1	Amazing how people can deny the one constant in the entire universe... Science.
1	Pfizer and Novac are RNA vaccines, the RNA goes into the cell and triggers the protein creation. Astron and J&J are DNA modified virus vaccine that delivers DNA to the cell, which then must be changed to RNA, and then finally the protein. It doesn't take a rocket scientists to understand that one process is far more direct and better than the other and this is reflecting clearly in the efficacy rates. No doctor on earth will get up and say the J&J is the better if given the choice between the two. Ideally you want the vaccine to be the protien, but that takes years of development, RNA is next best, then after that the virus DNA method.
0	I will never take it I do have family members who regret taking it
0	NO thanks my body my choice.
0	I hate every decomentary where a girl speaks like she's forced toüòé
0	No one should trust a word these actors are saying. Go with your gut.
1	I believe in vaccines. Since they improve public confidence and trust in the healthcare system.
1	we have to do that for getting collective immunity.
1	I want my grandparents to live
0	The re-emergence of the disease following vaccination of a majority of adults during a season at which viral illness tends to be at a seasonal indicates the jabs evidently do not prevent transmission very effectively, if at all.
0	With nearly all ICU admissions &amp; Deaths being #vaccinated now, #NSW Health in Australia suddenly announces (as of 1/1/2023): "Vaccination status of cases admitted to hospital, admitted to ICU &amp; those who die will no longer be reported!" Source: https://t.co/JmeX03lLvE #vaccines
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
1	This video made me feel so much better about getting the vaccine. I suffer with an anxiety disorder that causes hypochondria and I‚Äôve been given so much misinformation from family and online that has scared me to death to get it. Now I feel guilty looking at other countries that are suffering because they don‚Äôt have it. I‚Äôm getting my first dose today because of you. Thank you so much.
0	I trust my immune system
1	According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, "most childhood immunizations are 90%-99% effective in preventing disease."
0	I can never get my baby back, and the thought of what this vaccine may have done to them is unbearable
1	the barrier seems to be antivaxxers are loud as fuck when states try to pass this
0	People under the age of 18 have a high risk of contracting heart infections during vaccination... vaccination is horrible!
0	I believe that the government's vaccine recommendations are driven by profit.
0	Pfizer has taken away 2 yrs of my life. I fight this battle, vaccine injured like many of my vaccine injured family. We will not take this anymore. We will not be quiet, censored or ignored. We are taking a stand. Hear us loud and clear. Together we stand.
0	So relieved that I didn‚Äôt crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
0	Anybody caught covid recently because although news on covid is still circulating I only seem to be seeing vaccinated ppl getting sick.
1	The vaccines are a godsend!  My husband has been able to go back to work as a substitute teacher bc of the vaccine & I finally have the house to myself. lol
1	By getting vaccinated, you are contributing to public health efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of your community.
1	I can't wait to get my 16th booster shot to finally end this pandemic!
0	Jabbed or not, this crime was committed against all of humanity. It was planned & it was purposeful. It's GENOCIDE!
1	Getting vaccinated is a step towards a brighter future. Let's all do our part!
0	The COVID Vaccine contains the Epicyte Gene. It's a sterilization agent that renders both men and women sterile, it's permanent and irreversible. It denies a key protein required for women to conceive and sperm to be formed. See Youtube video on The Epicyte gene that's also been engineered into most commercial corn and all corn products consumed. The sterilization is passed on genetically and will take 3 generations to sterilize 100%, we're now just one generation from big, big population drops.
0	My dad took a second Pfizer booster last January. He passed away of congestive heart failure two months later. He was 90, but his health rapidly deteriorated after his second booster shot.
0	Me and my parents are unvaccinated and still here completely healthy.
0	I'm not taking the vaxx or another other vaccine for that matter.

1	So grateful to be fully vaccinated!!!
1	How many you got,? I want it all
1	I just got the Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine yesterday.
0	it's mandatory by society for literally no reason, doesn't effect your reaction to covid, doesn't stop infection or death, does have side effects. Literally more people with the vaccine are now in hospitals than unvaccinated. If you can call it a vaccine
0	SORRY for English.....JAPAN close to my HEART......Its VERY BAD.....They DONT CARE......I am VERY SORRY......NO Poltician Took the VAX....NONE....KISHIDA 5 Shots is a LIE......AUSSIE PM-No Syringe.....They Tricked the People. COVID LIE for FINANCIAL RESET by 2024
1	So excited!!! first Vaccine DONE!! No pain, no line, no waiting!!!
1	Vaccines are like a superhero suit for our body, protect us from the bad guys
0	Was I the only person that pondered the fact that it was absolutely impossible to know the long term effects from this shot. Looking back, thank God I quit my job and found one that didn't mandate it.
1	The chance of getting sick is reduced by vaccinations, and they are all quite effective at reducing hospitalization and death from COVID 19.
0	I know one person who died of heart attack at 38, and another one who got a blood clot in brain, both were healthy prior to vaccine.
1	Love hearing that the covid 19 vaccine is here and ready to help protect us.
0	I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	I‚Äôm glad my mom decided to vaccinate me and that I‚Äôm protected from a ton of disease.
0	I appreciate the thoughtful answer, but I still have concerns about the potential long-term side effects for myself and others in similar situations. I believe it's important for everyone to make informed decisions based on their personal health and risks, and to understand that the vaccine can affect your health for the rest of your life
0	The virus hasn't made its way into my body naturally, theres no way in hell im going to introduce it into my body on purpose. And everyone elses safety is not my damn responsibility.
1	Vaccination builds immunity for society and marks the end of the pandemic.
0	There was a nurse who took the Covid-19 vaccine. She developed transverse myelitis, demyelination of the spine and a bunch of other severe neurological issues. She is now disabled for life.
1	As someone who relies on herd immunity due to severe chronic autoimmune illness, thank you so much for this video. Please, everyone who can, who is healthy and able, please get vaccinated! You are saving the lives of those you don't even know !
0	I know exactly when to get my my booster, NEVER¬†best decision I ever made was refusing your posion
0	Hi thanks for letting me vent Had my booster and since then my whole left side is weak.  I have bladder issues I can barely move my arm at all. It‚Äôs very painful and they still can‚Äôt figure out what‚Äôs wrong and it‚Äôs all after the vaccine. I‚Äôm so frustrated. Anybody else is the same issues
1	This is full of misinformation.
1	Only a month or so ago I got 2 shots of Moderna with zero side effects, except a mildly sore arm for a few hours. Everyone is different. I‚Äôm in Australia. Then the national and international borders opened up and I went to a music festival which disregarded vaccine status, I caught covid a week after getting my shots. All I had was a sniffle for a few days. I was really opposed to getting the jab but in the end I‚Äôm glad I did. Just follow what feels right for you. Do not buy into separation that comes from many sides out there.
1	Imagine you're DC, hoping for a win, and months before your next big movie, the main actor decides to pop into Twitter with some antivaxx shenanigans.  #VaccinesWork #Vaccinated https://t.co/oxlEICaHBD
1	I often feel like I'm living in an episode of the Twilight Zone: the hypocrisy, the conspiracy theories, the denunciation of science. These are bizarro times.
1	You have to support the vacccine and the nurses!
1	Well, I'm vaxxed, got Covid just a few days ago. Kicking my ass, but I'm not feeling any worse than when I got the Swine Flu back in the day. Last I checked, my symptoms don't include death.
1	BuT ITs uNAturAl!!!!
1	As a nurse, I survived the pandemic with insufficient PPE, so felt I was giving my shot to someone who needed/wanted it. The opposite of the coercion campaign. I am GOOD!
0	A friend of mine in the Netherlands is in mourning. His mother took the Pfizer jab and began losing speech and motor function. Within weeks she was placed in hospice, on morphine, and told she had maybe two weeks to live. This is tragic, and I feel so bad for the family.
1	Antivaxxers are quite literally a drain on society
0	14. "I trust the science behind the vaccine and believe it's safe."
1	Getting mine Saturday!
0	I'm terrified for my friends and family that took the triple you know what.
0	It was just given to people who can't think for themselves.
1	Sadly, 99% of the people dying from Covid-19 now are the people without the #vaccine.
1	The people who are against covid vaccines are calling people who have not had the covid vaccine pure bloods. Hope that clears that up for you.
1	Only cool bitches has Moderna! #vaccin #Moderna
1	Vaccines contain the same antigens that are found on pathogens that cause the associated disease, but exposure to the antigens in vaccines is controlled. #VaccinesWork shun #misinformation and #GetVaccinated
0	So glad I was able to resist the pressure to get injected with that garbage.
1	This is silly. I released a PSA weeks ago highlighting the fact that the COVID vaccine saves lives, I chose to get the COVID vaccine, and asking Virginians to join me in getting vaccinated
0	I'm not sure about taking the vaccine, we don't know what is in it
0	People are still dying , also getting side effects from the jab
0	This is more common than one can think I've heard so many cases of heart failure paralyzed limps and brainfog in my close friends circle!
1	I feel that everyone should get vaccines. We can help keep our family safe and ensure that our hospitals do not get overrun with people.
1	My son got the vaccine, and he is proud he is protecting those around him!
1	lol there's literally so much evidence for vaccines i don't get how people can still be anti vax
1	If there is one thing that reading about science has taught me it is that it made me realize how important it is to be honest about uncertainties. Because if we aren't aware about what we are uncertain about we cannot find out what is actually going on. And also there is the fact that for all things learned through science. Uncertainty can be very low. But never zero. So any truth can be challanged. Nothing is holy in science. Just more or less certain.   And the science of vaccines is certain enough to get my support.
0	Not taking the covid gene therapy injectables does not make anyone anti vaccines
1	When is the 6th one coming???? Thanks to the vaccine; I‚Äôve NOT been COVID-19 positive; even I am working for a 24 hours hospital, a high risk setting , and traveling abroad twice -after the traveling restrictions lifted.
0	It‚Äôs a de-population bio weapon.
1	I honestly can't think of a good reason not to get it. Unless you are allergic to the vaccine ingredients or your doctor told you not to get it for a medical reason.
1	Last 6 months, 2,211 Victorians died from Covid. 949 (43%) were unvaccinated, even though they only account for 6% of the population. Vaccines save lives. #GetVaccinated
0	I got my first Pfizer dose 1 week ago. The next day, it felt like someone was squeezing my head at both temples, but it wasn‚Äôt that bad as I still went to work. I just took neurofen. I had localized pain at the site of injection which was normal. It wasn‚Äôt that bad. It just felt like someone punched me in the arm for 3-4 day. However, I‚Äôve had shortness of breath & chest pains for 1 week now & its still ongoing. Went for a GP check up & was told all is ok & to go to ER if it got worse.I only got it bc my work mandated it...no jab no job. I wish I didn‚Äôt get it
1	Getting vaccinated is a sign of strength and resilience. Let's all do our part to bring an end to this pandemic.
1	Then just get flipping vaccinated because it‚Äôs irresponsible not to.
0	Yoo thats a really good find. The patterns tell us what we already though would happen.  This is some really horrible news for the vaccinated people. I hope people make it out of this.
0	No. And I encourage everyone else not to. You will be the lab rats for this FDA NOT-approved but emergency-authorized vaccine.
1	My family (I live with my grandparents) were at more risk for Coivd. Not only were my grandparents just an older couple, but my grandfather has also had lung problems, and diabetic problems. So when we heard of the Covid Vaccine we waited just a little so that it wasn't like a zombie virus ,lol, but then got our vaccines. As of late 2021, me and my grandfather are actually BOOSTED against covid-19, so I'm ready to go outside and not worry about anything, then maybe forgetting a mask.
1	Where a mask every time I go out. Got the vaccine and booster. I have to protect myself from all the others who don't care if Americans live or die.
0	Pretty sure vaccine is more dangerous then COVID. Brought to you by Pfizer, the company mutating COVID.
0	My neighbor died from a massive heart attack the day after she got the vaccine
1	Vaccines are safe, effective, and thoroughly tested. Don't believe misinformation, trust the science!
0	Thank you for sharing with us your thoughts and concerns about the vaccine. I am thankful to choose to be unvaccinated. God bless you. üá≥üá¥
0	Coworker took her 7year old in for vax. As soon as the shot was administered, his eyes rolled back into his skull and he had a seizure... been having seizures non-stop since
0	This is not the first time the USA has tried to mandate a vaccine in the name of a pandemic.
1	It is mostly young people that choose not to be vaccinated. Fine, that is their right. If there should be another outbreak and hospitalization necessary, these unvaccinated folks should not have priority in an overcrowded hospital. Cots could be placed in the halls or up on the roof, wherever there is room to accommodate them. Because they are young, precedence would be given them over a sick elderly person who was vaccinated. That should absolutely not be. I know this sounds harsh, however, those who choose not to be vaccinated, not given priority.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a crucial step in the right direction. Let's all work together to end this pandemic.
1	I've learned that this is a pointless task. A large percentage of the population will never be convinced.
1	I believe that vaccines have greatly reduced the incidence of many deadly diseases.
1	Yes, it is important for everyone to get themselves vaccinated as soon as possible. Keeping in view of the constant increase in Covid cases it is pertinent to get yourself vaccinated within reasonable time since it improves your immunity and helps your body to fight against Covid 19 virus.
1	Everyone should get a vaccine, if not for yourself, for your family. You won‚Äôt get sick and can‚Äôt pass Covid onto others. Break the chain.
1	Vaccine's should've never been politicized...growing up as a kid we all got vaccinated and no one ever asked what party we voted for etc. Loving your neighbor means protecting each other and we need as many people vaccinated as possible. I truly feel bad for the immune compromised and all the children who are waiting for approval. The world needs more love and no one want's to die, get vaccinated!
0	No, wearing a good mask does far more to protect others than a COVID vaccine
0	Saying the covid vaccines are safe and effective is not a lie, it‚Äôs three lies.
1	Just got my first dose yesterday, and YouTube recommended me this video.
0	I'm vaccine free and still very healthy and never got sick for more than a decade
1	As a healthcare worker, getting vaccinated was not only a personal choice for my own safety, but it was also a responsibility to my patients. I encourage everyone to take advantage of this opportunity to protect themselves and others
0	Woe to those. Who call evil good, and good evil.
0	Let me get this straight it's a fairly new technology but its safe. No serious concerns except for those who died or have disability. Clinical trials are not done until 2023 but it's safe. INGENIOUS! Thank you
1	Vaccination works. Look at these amazing figures from Bolton. Get vaccinated as soon as you can. It's the only way out of this nightmare!
0	My friend's colleague passed away due to heart attack one week after he took the boost shot, in his 20s, that guy was said to be in perfect health condition. I started to realize this is not a low chance issue.
1	Hope more definitive information comes out on how to handle this. Hope also the supply of vaccines increases.
1	Data has shown that people that are up to date with their shots have a much lower probability of going to the hospital when infected with Covid
0	Vaccines are the biggest scam in history
0	I've been tested three dozen times and I am yet to test positive. And I have been to the hospital many times for some treatment for a mild genetic condition. And none of my close relatives have had COVID. We are all vaccinated, but that can't be it!
1	I got COVID a few weeks ago but was vaccinated. I only suffered a cough and a loss of taste. I shudder to think what would have happened if I got it a year ago before vaccinations opened
1	Vaccination eliminated smallpox, and is real close to finishing off polio, vaccination works.
0	Not safe
1	fair enough, but lactose intolerant people still eat cheese, because in the end, it‚Äôs worth it (only if the negative reactions to the vaccine are temporary, which I think they are from what I‚Äôve heard)
1	Pro-vaccine all the way!
1	Pride moment of the india that finally we all get vaccine soon but still we have to be alert and thanks to mama and mami  ü§óü§óüíêü§óüíê to show us his journey and giving us such an important motivation related to medical thank u again
1	The Vaccines are safe and effective. Medical research proves this.
1	So I guess that this woman believes that the 1.1 million deaths from covid 19 were really from lightning strikes or shark attacks.
0	My father passed away due to vaccine he was healthy happy he got his first shot of Pfizer vaccine and the next day he passed away !
1	So I just joined a vaccine trial. I am one tough blood draw though and I fainted so they have to redraw tomorrow. For any of you who have this issue too or vasovagul response, please give me all your tips so I can be more successful.
0	I was one of the lucky one's during COVID. My company never required the vaccine for employment. I chose to stay unvaccinated. I have zero regrets.
0	Vaccines are genetic changes!!! Lier World Hell Organization!
0	Except we're not 'anti-vaxxers', we're just declining these particular vaccines because they're dangerous, unnecessary and ineffective. 'Anti-vaxxer' is a stupid smear used by propagandists.
1	If you fail to vaccinate your children that is child abuse. Furthermore, when you neglect to vaccinate your children you put others with compromised immune systems at risk for death. Do the right thing and vaccinate your children
0	Of course....we told ya'll we already been thru this with Tuskegee experiments and your gument giving Black people syphilis..im glad ya''ll finally waking up tho....better late than never I guess.
1	Vaccinations work.
0	I try to follow the science, but I keep ending up at the money.
0	Very, very proud and relieved to be un-vaxed.
0	They lied and said it was safe
0	My kids don't be having your vacine because they are young and I had such a horrible time my eyes where burning like fire and my urine u could not sleep for weeks
1	74 percent of covid cases in Massachusetts today are fully vaccinated people , vaccines don't stop covid just helps with symptoms, now tell some more misinformation chloroquine has the same effect if not better
0	Yes let‚Äôs take a rushed vaccine what could possibly go wrong
0	Do we even know if Bill Gates was vaccinated? He doesn't have his kids receive ANY vaccination.
0	Everyone in government and media --- especially media --- who promoted the baseless propaganda that the pfake "vaccines" are "safe and effective" after the data began to show otherwise should be tried for crimes against humanity, and punished accordingly. Resulting deaths will eventually number in the millions, tens of millions, and/or hundreds of millions.
1	I got the 3 shots and I didn't get sick any time. I'm from Brazil. Here the vaccination was slow at the beginning, but now we are almost finishing!
1	Achieving immunity can only be accomplished through widespread vaccination.
1	I feel a sense of responsibility to protect myself and others by getting vaccinated against COVID-19.
0	this article doesn't make his statement any better. nothing in the article, or indeed the trials, or indeed the corona virus stats show that there is any reason to vaccinate children. if a child is on a transplant list, sure, get the vaccine if the parents and doctors think it's necessary, but I think everyone would agree that those are rare cases. the vast majority of children simply do not need the vaccine. i feel for parents that get their 5 year old child vaccinated and the kid suffers a severe reaction. an absolutely pointless result. it's like going to get a tooth pulled out when there isn't anything wrong with it, because one day it may get a cavity. except this is far more serious.
0	Hopefully, utilizing a range of smart behavioural science insights will drive vaccine uptake.
1	Yep, fully vaccinated and have gotten Covid-19 twice. While I do support getting the vaccine, it improves one's chance of not dying from it. I also support one's choice to not get it.
1	The antibodies created by immunizations will protect you even if you never get sick.
1	I‚Äôm going to keep wearing my mask üò∑ because it‚Äôs still not safe enough. I know wearing a mask üò∑ isn‚Äôt full protection it just makes me feel more comfortable from other issues. People are so nasty and have always been that way,not washing hands or not covering their mouth when coughing. Just be aware and be careful with your surroundings. Best to us all and stay healthy!
0	I never had any of the jabs and I got Covid and it felt like a cold
0	I'm concerned about the long-term effects of the COVID-19 vaccine and don't want to take any chances.
0	I feel bad for the people who took it. They will now wait for the results of it
0	While I think you‚Äôre right, I hope you‚Äôre wrong. 95% of people I know and care for got the jab. If what you say is correct, I‚Äôll end up watching everyone I know die.
1	Don't believe the misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine. It's safe, effective, and the best way to protect ourselves and others. Get vaccinated and let's get back to normal.
1	Vaccination is a path towards returning to normal life.
0	Very small national audience for annual clot shot booster unless/until some really credible safety analysis is done and healthy people stop dropping dead suddenly at surprising rates. These public health officials have no ability to read the room - and the room is saying "we don't trust you after so many lies and so much misinformation".
0	That is what our immune systems are for.
0	First I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôll get vaccinated. Now I know for sure I will not get vaccinated
1	Getting vaccinated is a responsible choice that helps protect not just ourselves but also those around us.
0	My sister #DiedSuddenly. Of COVID. 26 hours after first showing a symptom.
0	i get all vacs, but not this one....too rushed and all of my relatives that got it developed paulsy... yeah i‚Äôll wait on that
0	Did you get lucky with the vax? Even if you did, you should detox immediately.  The long-term effects of this vaccine are deadly.
0	It's the long-term (unknown) side effects that concern me the most.
1	Covid can also cause these issues
1	It's good to know there is someone at the FDA with common sense.
1	I mean the math of the infection/death rates does a pretty good job of showing that vaccines work.
1	if it is safe and effective, the people around you who are vaccinated should not get covid and have few or no side-effects from the injection. your confidence in something is augmented by positive experiences.
0	My friend lectured me to get jab, he got his second, got blackout while driving, totaled car broke some bones, luckily survived.
1	"Go educate yourself" is a catchphrase uttered by anti-vaxxers, MLMers, and anyone else who spent a whole hour at the Internet College of Misinformation.
1	Vaccination is a necessary step for resuming normal travel.
1	How awesome it is to look now from 2021 and see, that researchers achieved what they promised, mRNA shots already saved millions of lives .
0	It‚Äôs unreal how many people were fooled/tricked/scared into getting these shots. So glad I never gave in.
0	His right, I respect that. People vaccinated have a lifetime to worry about the implications. Many get it and die or have severe health problems.....ask the people who had severe reactions if they would do it again. Works both ways.
0	Thank fuck I've never been tested or vaxxed. We are bearing witness to the biggest every silent holocaust in the history of hunanity. Tick Tock Tick Tock Tick Tock BOOM
1	the sooner we get the large majority of people in this country vaccinated, the sooner we return to near normal.
0	The only vax I would take at this point would be the Rabies vax if I were bitten by an animal suspected of having rabies.
0	I don't trust the government or big pharmaceutical companies to have my best interests in mind
1	I had Covid in February. Got my vaccine in April. Glad to reduce my chance of getting it again and spreading it to others who may be more vulnerable.
0	My friends and I ,who remain unvaccinated ,really care deeply for all . We only want the best health for all. It was a very stressful past couple of years for us. For one thing, where I live, it seems the government was building a camp, which it was rumoured we‚Äôd end up in . I hope that more people from here on in pay attention, ask more questions and demand investigation and accountability . This can‚Äôt happen again. For our employees , the government , to be wielding such extreme power with no real personal responsibility in general is beyond belief .
1	The vaccine is a lifesaver, it's giving us hope in these challenging times.
1	Overwhelming majority of people that get vaccinated, myself included, felt mildly unwell for the first 24 hours. I'll take that to being on a ventilator
1	#COVID19 vaccination offers protection against serious disease. Here are some candid answers from individuals in #Indonesia üáÆüá© about their motivation to get #vaccinated.   üìå https://t.co/OakrDvQoLu   üì∏: WHO/Nyimas Laula https://t.co/OOvG9xq1z5
1	After 2 boosters, I'm absolutely thrilled that science prevailed.
0	Any vaccine that took less than 6 years for approval, I will not put in my body. It's insane that we skirted that rule out of fear.
0	Before the vaccine, covid-19 had a 98.5% recovery rate. After the vaccine, covid-19 had a 98.5% recovery rate. The vaccine didn't do anything.
0	Trust no one assume everyone will betray you and you'll never be disappointed
0	even with vaccines when you take them you can't just walk around with out maskes u still have wear them i stick to washes my hands wear my mask for now on
1	Just wait for a few years and we will see outbreaks of easily preventable diseases because of antiv-vaxxers not vaccinating their kids.
0	HERD IMMUNITY IS FAKE! The real Herd Immunity got killed after vaccines
0	However, if the covid "vaccine" is effective, why the fuck do you need 5?
1	This is exactly why Trump started becoming pro vaccine a while back. He realized all his supporters were dying from covid. At his rallies, he told everyone to get vaccinated and they all booed him.
0	Stay in your clean smart city‚Äôs and let us unvaccinated get on with our life‚Äôs
0	I got 3 shots and my heart has not been right since. I'm 43.
1	I got vaccinated on this day afternoon moderrna vaccine it's good to my body ü•∞
0	It's about harmful drugs being labelled as "vaccines" to fool us.
1	I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt trust the doctor when they tell people to get vaccinated, but they trust the exact same doctor to treat them for the illness they could have been vaccinated against.
1	excited for my second booster
1	After 2 full years of participation I am FINALLY DONE with the Moderna Covid Vaccine trials!
1	Cue the anti-vaxers who don't believe in science and data
0	Million people and instead gave them a new vaccine, there's a significant risk that those heart attacks, cancer diagnoses, and deaths will be blamed on the vaccine.
1	We need as much as we can get right now, we need everyone vaccinated yesterday
0	I know people who vaxxed their children and now they are cursing the day they were born!
1	Just got vaccinated! Let's work together to protect our communities and bring an end to this pandemic
1	Because so much of the world is still unvaccinated it's only a matter of time until a more deadly variant emerges. People who are vaccinated are likely to have some amount of immunity, while those who aren't (and go around maskless) will be decimated.
1	Getting vaccinated is a sign of hope. We can finally see the end of this pandemic. #HopeIsHere
0	I am worried about getting full blown COVID and I am worried about a dead fragmented version of COVID made in a lab. All of it freaks me out. I'm going to wait, keep my bubble small and after I've had my final baby and stopped breastfeeding... two years will have passed and all the kinks of this shot will have been worked out. I'm definitely not getting it while pregnant.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	The reward is too low to get the vaccine and risk my health.
0	After what we know now and all the people that have been severely damaged by the "vaccine", I have to admit my shock that Dr. Cohen would still say that he thinks the vaccine is still appropriate for some.
1	Vaccines do not make you immune to spreading it, potentially, but they do confer a resistance to your immune system such that, if you should get infected despite all your best efforts at social distancing, wearing masks, etc., you (1) will have much less severe symptoms and, as a corollary, (2) will be much less likely to die.
0	i‚Äôm chronically ill and starving to die at times from pain , since 30 micrograms injection .
1	Thankfully, most people get that vaccinations are important. It's terrifying that so many people don't get it though.
0	Very against. My close friend died of Organ Failure last week, 54, she was never ill
0	I am not going to get the COVID vaccine shot for the following reasons.There are many more people who are at much greater risk than I due to their age and multiple comorbidities. I am seeing them having issues getting their appointments for the first shot and then trying to get in the cue for the follow up shots.
1	He already sounds like he has breathing problems and/or a cold. Covid will definitely slap that smile off his face.
1	We have vaccines, life-saving vaccines, but they're not fully used everywhere.
1	I might have covid19. I want the damn vaccine lol. It seems to be the only hope.
0	There may be infrequent adverse reactions to a vaccination when given to a sizable enough population, but there may also be unconnected coincidences.
0	So many injured because, like this lovely woman, they thought they were doing the right thing and they trusted the ‚Äúscience‚Äù. So very sad.
1	Thank you to the scientists who rapidly developed these vaccines. Thank you to my doctor who let me know that, even without a fever, I should test for COVID if I have cold symptoms. I still mask up.
0	A Pastor friend died 15 days after the vax.
1	woooooooooooow, thanks man, really appreciate that information. even though i follow alot of left wing and right wing media, i havent heard a better explanation of this pandemic anywhere. Atleast now i knw why vaccine should work. and the uncertainity point was excellent. thanks
0	It's just normal winter flu plus vaccination damages and ruined immune systems.
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
0	PATIENT: Does this vaccine provide immunity? DOCTOR: Only for the manufacturer
0	Get Vaccinated, so we can impose a vaccine passport on your life that will require annual booster shots to remain compliant for freedom of movement...üëç
0	What a shill   How does it feel knowing the vaccines are more dangerous than the virus?  If any of you libtards think I‚Äôm lying @ me I‚Äôll send u my sources
0	I‚Äôm pro vaccines in general, but there‚Äôs a point where the cure/vaccine is potentially worse, if administered to the whole population, than the disease
0	Covid vaccines are much more hazardous for our health than the virus itself. I refuse to do it.
1	we dont care if you have natural immunity. you must get this shot to protect others...
1	Where are all these vaccine deaths? I know 5 people personally who died of covid, most of those before the vaccine was available. But literally none who died from the vaccine or even a very weird or suspicious death.
0	I‚Äôve had Covid many times throughout my life. It used to be called the Flu before it was rebranded to promote mass hysteria and experimental mRNA vaccines.
1	I get mine today!
0	The good news about the vaccine is that you can't get covid again, because you'll likely already be dead.
1	Getting the Pfizer shot Tuesday and a little nervous
0	Yeah honestly I cannot even date someone who can be this easily brainwashed ... lord knows I also would not want to be pressured into getting an experimental vaccine everyday. More power to you. Maybe you can slowly start to reason with your partner. What Im realizing is that the vaccinated folks don‚Äôt want to accept that they have been duped so they just push it harder bc no one likes to feel like they have potentially harmed themselves willingly and have been lied to ... it‚Äôs a hard pill to swallow
0	Lol. The jobsite I'm working on the waxinated with 3 jabs are just as sick as the un unvaccinated. The new variant don't care.
0	there's no solid reason to trust any big pharma.
1	90% of Covid hospitalisations are anti vaxx loons. Wake up you guys.
1	All the question from the antivax side could easly be answered by 2 minutes of googling...
1	Just take the shot so that we can stay safe!
0	a guy who is pretty vocal about being pro vax, and very scared of Covid just died randomly. I know he‚Äôs not older than 45 (I think he‚Äôs even younger than that). He was thin, active, and healthy, and they said it was ‚Äúnatural causes, but sudden and not expected‚Äù.  Other than that, they say it‚Äôs not appropriate to say what the cause was (while we‚Äôre all openly mourning him.. )  I can‚Äôt get out of my head whether or not he came down with a vac or Covid related issue, but nobody will address it. It‚Äôs super weird, I‚Äôm just getting ALL the weird vibes tbh.
0	I‚Äôm pretty sure having politicians spread vaccine and pro-Ukraine propaganda is MUCH MORE dangerous than having people like Nick Fuentes on this platform. Vaccines and war LITERALLY kill people. Words and jokes do not.
1	The vaccines are a life savor. Those that refuse to get are playing Russian roulette with their lives. So be it! You can deal with stupid!
1	I am so sick of ppl acting like having to wear a mask or get a vaccine to save your life or your family life is such a big problem. So a person is drowning and someone gives you a life saver, what is your reason for not taking it?
0	There are no credible data to prove the long-term safety and efficacy of this vaccine. At this stage, it‚Äôs still experimental, even if all regulatory approvals are in place.
1	Get vaccinated and protect yourself and others from serious illnesses.
1	I got both Pfizer vaccines and had zero complications! So glad I got it!
1	Yah that sounds like long covid. You def shouldve got that second jab.
0	Not one bit. That these drugs require the suppression of adverse events data speaks volumes.
0	True Serbs dont get vaccinated
1	"My own research" simply means "I went on Facebook, read some BS and now I'm an idiot".
1	Finally got my second dose and feeling relieved! Thank you to all the scientists and healthcare workers making this possible
1	Truth. I got the J&J a couple months ago and this week I've been getting sicker and sicker but it's not severe (yet and hopefully not at all). My whole work shift has the same symptoms. My County in my State has the highest delta spread right now. If I do have Covid, oh I'd hate to see how I'd be doing if I didn't have the shot.
0	Utterly ridiculous to require children to be vaccinated against something that‚Äôs of no consequence to them.
0	#Covid a strange so called #pandemic followed by an even stranger so called #vaccine '. Heavily #vaccinated #countries have more #excessdeath , post the rollout of the 'vaccine', than they did during the pandemic (without the 'vaccine'). Go figure. #VaccineDeaths #vaccineinjuries https://t.co/otIjkYhiRh
0	They actually think this will change peoples minds? WE CAN'T CONFIRM WHAT'S IN THE SYRINGE.. come on this is just lazy. Don't take this garbage for this overblown hoax.
0	It gives people myocarditis. Sometimes seizures. We've seen it a bunch of times.  Oh, and lots of blood clots.
1	Just get a vaccine and stop endangering the lives of others you, you sperge
0	It is obvious what the real conspiracy is....however billions of sheep totally blinded and remain brainwashed
0	Glad I never took it this doctor is so sketchy on this news show
1	Lot of people in these comments who need to sit down and wonder why they don't have smallpox.
1	Free boosters now, go and get them
1	Is the second dose that much of a difference? Get it in 7 days
1	A woman I work will not get it either of them. She fears getting autism. She is 58. Another thinks it‚Äôs a live virus being injected. That‚Äôs what we are up against here. The science is amazing. üá¶üá∫
1	I commend these scientists working on the vaccine, they wait their whole lives for a chance like this. To put everything they learned in school and apply it to the real world, and help save alot of people.
1	After 4 shots, I am still living the same life without any problems as of before Covid19.
0	The insurance companies should sue the makers of the vax, and make them accountable!!
1	I feel like it‚Äôs my duty to get one, I‚Äôm 26, former college athlete so i feel that I‚Äôll be okay
1	Vaccines cause adults
0	Since being forced by my utility job to get vaccinated I have been sick roughly twice a month. I for the first time in my life have the flu currently. Im fully with you on this being a depopulation tool because I never used to get sick. Anyone saying I wasn‚Äôt forced‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I could have either gave up my $50/hr job in NY for a minimum wage job or I could get vaccinated. Which I did. Then two weeks later the government ruled it BS and all the mandates went away and I have been consistently getting sick since. This is my circumstance it may not be the same as all of yours.
0	How many of those vaxxed loser are on their repeat bout of Covid?
0	This makes me so nervous I was forced to get this shit , I was working as a CNA at a nursing home to provide for my daughter , I‚Äôm a single mom and I remember my whole family feeling nervous because I was soooo against it, when I got my vaccine I felt so upset. I really hope nothing happens to me long term fr fr
1	My doctor prescribed my vaccination because of my health issues, I haven't had any problems with the shot
0	As well as they should. As a matter of fact everywhere should be doing the same. Even children are dying from the shot.
1	More people are dying from covid than could ever die from a nuclear war and it's all because of conspiracy theories on social media cuzza the antivaccines nuts
1	I had covid right at the beginning months before the vaccine and was, in fact, close to dying. I'd rather take the vaccine 5x a day then ensure covid again. But anyways.
0	There are still far too many unknown, untested variables regarding the vaccine. Leading scientists claim for it to be safe, but data (or lack thereof) says otherwise. It is impossible to assure the public a vaccine is safe without having long-term data.
1	Friendly neighborhood Zillenial here, getting my second shot in about two weeks
1	Getting vaccinated had a couple of huge effects for me: I never got hospitalized with COVID; I didn't die from COVID.
0	I cannot trust a vaccine produced this quick. So many steps skipped.
0	Your more likely to get covid over and over if your vaccinated. It‚Äôs because the covid vaccine has a negative impact on your natural immune system similar how AIDS affects your immune system.
0	What a shill How does it feel knowing the vaccines are more dangerous than the virus? If any of you libtards think I‚Äôm lying @ me I‚Äôll send u my sources
0	My doctor advised against me getting it, unless I really wanted to. From his research, anyone active and in good health are generally safe.
0	Absolute not. I'd possibly concede to the vaccine myself but no way I'd put my child into a trial for a vaccine for a disease that doesn't hurt them. Although I guess if my kid was super keen for some reason and I thought they were legit. https://t.co/knARXv2Zwj
1	I‚Äôm a teacher so I was in the priority group. I received my vaccine as soon as I could
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
1	Vaccination is the most important thing we can do to protect ourselves and our children against covid.
0	I'm with the doctor... I'm so sick of mainstream media. People have a choice... And not everyone wants to pump their body with something that they have no guarantees wont effect them negatively. Vilifying doctors for making an informed decision is infuriating.
1	43. "I don't trust the government when it comes to the vaccine."
1	I‚Äôm vaccinated. Everyone I know is vaccinated. Not one single person has had any complications or has been hospitalized. Like this tweet if you are vaccinated and have not had any issues.
0	My strategy was never take any shot, avoid mask, travel and enjoy life
0	i think it's important to weigh the risks and benefits for all vaccines, not just the seasonal flu shot. and in the end, it comes down to individual decision making
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
1	I feel grateful for the opportunity to get vaccinated and to help protect those around me.
1	I got 3 vaccine shots and a previous virus, since Feb 2022 my health has been outstanding.
0	a friend of me got covid 19 and he was vaccinated...
1	I never got COVID. I am current with vaccine boosters and I wear masks in public place like Train, Theaters. I take a shower as soon as I came home from shopping/office etc.
1	Just got my vaccine today! Feeling really good and happy. Stay safe everyone <3
1	I took my first shot of Pfizer todayüôÇ
1	I got the Johnson vaccine two days ago, I was a bit worried that it wasn't as good as the Pfizer and biontech , but this video cleared it up for me!
1	Has nothing to do with the vaccine
0	If you are OK with forcing people to take the covid vaccine, You are a NAZI.
1	We got the Covid-19 vaccine.. Moderna.. that was a month and a half ago since the second shot. My SO has several underlying conditions. I'm relieved that he got the vaccine‚Ä¶ hoping he won‚Äôt get a ‚ÄúBreakthrough Infection.‚Äù
1	Getting vaxed not only gives us freedom to go without masks. It also lifts the anxiety of wondering if I have the Rona
0	Me or nobody in my family ever had covid. We also did not get any vaccine or boosters. We did not wear any masks or gloves and went everywhere as usual. Still got all my DNA intact. I prefer to keep it that way. Each to his/her own.
0	It's important to have credible sources to back up claims, especially when it comes to health. I haven't been able to find any solid sources on the positive effects either.
0	Yeah, those ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù work sooo well and have no side effects. Keep living the dream
1	I‚Äôm disgusted, irate & sore w/people not getting vaccinated when there‚Äôre still people dying all over the world from #COVID19. Willful ignorance is a killer.
1	I initially had Pfizer vaccines 8 months ago. Side effects were pretty annoying. Chills and fatigue kept me pretty much in bed for 3 days. I got a Moderna booster over 24 hours ago and side effects are less than the Pfizer dose. Much less fatigue. Less chills. Less arm pain. I wonder if my side effects are typical for the half dose.
0	Vaccine only good for giving people health problems or death
0	As I recall, the so called vaccine existed a year before COVID got out.
0	I admire their commitment to disease prevention, but when I ask for a more direct way to counter anti-vaccine aggression, I‚Äôm told, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not our approach; confrontation gives them a platform and oxygen.‚Äù
0	Millions?  Tell that to Japan as they keep setting records for deaths despite high vaccination rates.
1	Those who says that vaccines are no good should be shown footages/videos of rabies patients. I just wish someday, someone finds a cure for rabies after the onset of symptoms.
1	The vaccine is our best shot at ending this pandemic and getting back to normal life. Get yours when it's your turn!
0	Still not vaccinated‚Ä¶
1	Vaccines are the best way to protect our children and future generations.
0	Ingredients of the vaccines, sodium and chloride lol
1	One of my friends from high school unfollowed and blocked me because I'm pro-vaccine. She quit her job to be a professional astrologer. üòÇ
0	It's a hoax
0	the vaccine won't stop the spread and as you stated you are young and healthy so why risk it?
0	From a vaccine that does nothing. Yes. It also raises your chances to get sick.
1	appreciate you spreading awareness and congrats on getting your second dose!
1	My husband (over 65) and I (not) got COVID while in Spain at Christmastime. We'd both had the updated Pfizer booster and are very glad we did. Our symptoms were very mild, and I absolutely chalk that up to having had the original vaccine course + the new booster. Media need to stop promoting "evidence" that has not been validated; it does a disservice to the public.  P.S. Recommend wearing the darn mask when in indoor public spaces. We let down our guards and were both foolish and lucky.
0	The online pandemic of anti-vaccine misinformation is a front in the greater fight against infectious disease, and the informational vaccine employed to inoculate against it isn't doing so well. The "medication" isn't functioning very well because people aren't taking it, as is so frequently the case.
0	These vaccines are the biggest bullshit since the food pyramid
0	I‚Äôm not vaccinated and totally against vaccines for covid. Yet Trump is behind Operation Warpspeed. He circles around vaccine injuries.
0	"The vaccine is slightly safer than getting the illness" is a poor argument. Come back when the vaccine is as safe as all the other vaccines I have received in my life (aka: the illness they prevent are much, much worse than their respective vaccines).
0	I am also unvaccinated and plan to stay this way. But of all these vaccine injury videos I‚Äôve watched I don‚Äôt know of anybody in my major city who has had an adverse effect..but I still don‚Äôt want to take that small chance
1	I'm one of the over 75 persons and I've gotten all the vaccines that were/are available.  So far no infection at all.
0	Explain to me again why we need a vaccine
0	Why should you take something you don't need, healthy people under 70 don't need a vaccine
1	Vaccination provides a way for us to protect our loved ones, especially those who are more vulnerable to severe illness.
1	If you're not a doctor or scientist your comments are only opinions. Consider this... What if your opinion influences others against vaccinating a child and that child then becomes seriously ill or dies. Can you live with that? Let's just let medical and scientific professionals like the people on this channel give us the data in order to make our own informed decisions.
1	mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases prevent disease
0	How about NOT getting vaxxed and living normally. That way you don‚Äôt have a chance of seizures, blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks or Bell‚Äôs Palsy ‚ò∫
0	How about the tens of thousands dropping dead from heart failure including young children. PEOPLE NEED TO GO TO PRISON
1	People don't realize its a blessing just to even HAVE a vaccine right now.
0	21."I'm getting the COVID vaccine because I care about the health of my loved ones and myself."
1	Impossible, given the fact that the unvaccinated are over 11 times likely to die from Covid and seven times more likely to be hospitalized. Clearly the vaccines work extremely well!
0	Ridiculous. You expect this half-wit will convince anyone to get the shots? Absolute clowns.
1	The vaccine offers peace of mind.
0	The longer this has gone on, the more relieved I am that I never got the jab
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Thank god im getting vaccinated.
0	People better start realizing when they stole the 2020 election. Biden brought in the Bill Gates vaccine. Why is this mass murder still walking the streets?
1	Vaccination is literally the reason that we don‚Äôt have to worry about smallpox and polio
0	Of course its safe some politicians, pharmaceutical executives, celebrities and even the most trusted of all, billionaires have said so. How can anyone possibly doubt their words??? Unbelievable how ignorant so many of the public are, if Jordan says its safe, you can take it too the bank its safe, cause she knows her immunology!
0	Just have a syringe ready with anything inside even water. Tell them if they are happy for you to inject them with yours you will accept theirs, When they ask what the make up off the liquid inside your syringe is tell them you are not sure, If they ask if they can sue you in the event of death or serious illness tell them no as you have indemnity from prosecution, then ask the same question to them.
1	My wife and I are 8 months pregnant and it‚Äôs the first thing we wish we could do when the baby comes out.
1	I got that 1st moderna a week ago and I have been up and down on everything. Today i slept all day long. I'm still super tired. The only thing I've done differently was the vax. Also I felt like my arm was knuckle punched for 2 days, I couldn't lift it. I'm scared for #2..
1	Steven Spielberg on Covid19 vaccines: "Stay safe, get vaccinated as soon as you can"
1	I've had two doses of Pfizer, and 3 boosters... 2 Moderna and 1 Pfizer. And I will do it as long as I need to. I've never had COVID (as far as I know).
1	Yay for the covid 19 vaccine!

1	Vaccines are safe and effective, having undergone rigorous testing.
0	A friend of mine was the healthiest person one could hope to be. Two weeks after the vax he had a stroke and is struggling with his health now. Good Job.
1	This video is spreading misinformation. Vaccines saves lives.  COVID takes lives. According to ONS From March 2020 to October 2022, there are 88 deaths registered as due to COVID-19 in England and Wales. This is for the age under 1 to age 18 age band.
1	wouldn‚Äôt it be wise to consider to make non-vaccinated patients to pay for all the care they receive?
1	I chose to get vaccinated with the COVID vaccine because by doing so I feel better to protect my family, to protect my co-workers and myself. When I got it, I felt a little sore in my arm, a little tired, but that was it. Now I feel secure and protected
0	The clinical endpoint for the vaccine trial was *prevention of severe disease.* For most demographics (under 40, no comorbidities) the vaccine won't help..
0	Stop pushing this poison on people and leave us all alone
0	#AstraZenecaKills #FuckAstraZeneca How can one protect himself against a LETHAL DISEASE, like #coronavirus #COVID19 , using a LETHAL DRUG LIKE #AstraZeneca ????
0	The vaccine is truly affecting the vaccinated brain. I just heard one person say she‚Äôs so glad she‚Äôs not unvaccinated #pureblood bc she just caught Covid for the 8th time in 2 years and she‚Äôs had 5 booster shots. The jab ‚Äúsaved‚Äù her- She‚Äôs ‚Äúgrateful to be alive‚Äù. üò¨ God help them
0	First I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôll get vaccinated. Now I know for sure I will not get vaccinated
0	Since the vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop, or prevent COVID and the vaccine carries a risk of blood clots, that means I‚Äôm at much greater risk of blood clots if I take the vaccine since I‚Äôm still at risk of contracting Covid. Vaccine is a useless product, causing major risk factors
0	A persistent rapid heartbeat was one of the side effects I had after getting the vaccine.
1	Thank you for your testimony Jafreen. Unfortunately those who have never seen the effects of some of these terrible but preventable illnesses can never grasp the severity of it. They have the power of corrupted hindsight were they did not see the effects and assume all of these illnesses have been eradicated. They are the result of decades fighting preventable, through vaccinations, diseases. I am not a fan of cliche"but those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it."
1	I had my vaccines at a CC. I must say the queue was well organised and the staff very polite and patient. We are fortunate these staff are there for us. Together we stand-this message is very clear. Thank you very much.
0	Vaccine manufacturers have   ZERO LIABILITY   In case of injury or death caused by vaccines
1	Getting vaccinated helps prevent the spread of the virus.
1	I would rather be autistic (which I actually am) than not be vaccinated any day.
1	You can be isolated and not see your family if you not vaccinate, so the answe is yes for thge vaccin.
1	When I was 13, I choked on food. I stopped eating as I didn‚Äôt want to increase my risk of choking again. Join me and stop eating, don‚Äôt feed your children either, as they might choke aswell.
0	vax is poison
1	I wasn't doubting the vaccine, this cleared up my confusion on the differences between the vaccines.
0	Yeah like how can government officials promote this when they themselves don't take it?
1	I got vaccinated for COVID-19 and I feel grateful for the opportunity to protect myself and those around me.
0	Stopped taking any vaccines 17 years ago. Since then I've gotten sick once. About six months ago I got The Vid. Two days of aches and chills then fine. Now I'm immune from it. I think I'll.....continue to not take vaccines. I'm so healthy it makes doctors upset.
0	A healthy young adult has a much greater risk of complications from the vaccine than they do getting Covid. This is not true for any other vaccine used today. Unless you are elderly or have serious illnesses I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would continue to get MRNA vaccines and boosters.
1	Got my 4th Covid vax at Wal-Mart today.
1	Long lines on the first day of the bivalent omicron Covid booster down here in southern Vermont! Go get it!
0	My ex wife is still adamant on vaccinating our 7 year old healthy child, here in the US. While I‚Äôve made every attempt to show her the data, she refuses to listen, and calls me a conspiracy theorist and crazy. Even though we have joint custody, there is nothing I can legally do to stop her. It‚Äôs killing me.
1	My daughter has a severe egg allergy and many vaccines are suspended in a type of egg protein. I strongly believe in vaccines because I have an autoimmune disease and heart condition. So I as a parent took my daughter to a specialist who did all her vaccines in divided dosages and we stayed in the office for 2 hours after each dosage. She is now a healthy 14 year old and has outgrown the egg allergy and has had ALL of her vaccines
1	COVID is like the flu according to the antivaxxers.
0	Proud pureblood nurse here. We saw this problem from day 1. Many of us aren't so easily bullied into submission.
0	Antibodies may die but you also have T-cells which last much longer. Natural immunity through infection give better protection than a vaccine.
0	My neighbour still infected with covid even after they got 2 shot of vaccine, so? Whats the point in taking one if it's doesn't have any effect? And my neighbour (husband and wife) are working in hospital
1	got 4 thanks GOD and still wearing mask and keep distancing and handwash and alcohol whenever necessary
0	I'm so happy to see all these people resist this poison
0	As a 20 yr veteran, i applaud that they are fighting this unconstutoinal mandate to get us the poison jab
1	Thank you for the this! Vaccines save so many lives every year. This covid vaccine will be a wonderful gift into 2021.
1	I got one and done and no issues.
1	You're not a cave man come on even if v@xx is so that bad according to you you have to take it. Without Chemotherapy, v@xx and statin are great things it helped million of people. You can't live without chemical.
0	Covid is fake news
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	Proud unvaccinated and untested member of the tinfoil hat team
0	It‚Äôs come out so fast that it‚Äôs clearly politically and profit-motivated.
0	Pure blood checking in‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt take this shot
0	But the covid vaccine side effects are NOT mild to moderate; they are EXTREME, AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT IT.
1	Vaccines are the key to unlocking our freedom! Let's do this, people!
0	This aged so well. Even my elderly parents are like ‚Äúno more vaccines‚Äù. They blew all the belief in the medical establishment in 2 years‚Ä¶
1	They'll never admit they are wrong. And i really think they're taking the vaccine in all secrecy a/o anonymity. The only times I've heard people regretting was if they got sick af and almost hospitalized bc of the virus. But some will just die bc stubbornness
0	The fact that all of our governors got vaccinated is disheartening. Can we gut the entire government and start over?!?!?
0	Nothing about the vaccine is safe. I regret getting it.
0	Vaccine is dangerous
0	My husband didn't get the vax & had a very mild case; was just tired.  My relatives got the vax and suffered much more than he.
0	How about NOT getting vaxxed and living normally. That way you don‚Äôt have a chance of seizures, blood clots, myocarditis, heart attacks or Bell‚Äôs Palsy
1	a small Fact: Polio had a vaccine certification.
0	It felt fishy from the start, never will I ever. My kids and I have had it once, and it was like the common cold. My sister, however has had the shot and two boosters and has had it multiple times and misses work for several days. Something ain't right.
0	Vaccines cause #DiedSuddenly   I like the chances with covid better
1	a vaccine is like an insurance policy. You hope you don‚Äôt need it but if an accident (or illness) happens, your earlier efforts of monthly payments (or a shot) will lessen the blow if the unfortunate event comes around.
1	Vaccines have always been around so don't see the big deal. I remember back when everyone had to have their immunizations before starting school every year, etc.
1	For love's sake get your kids vaccinated.
0	Well done guys, from laymen perspective your presentation is invaluable, especially for those who have got the shots or those who are considering to. I am however highly cautious of any foreign agent that has to be injected into my body, and I think I will never allow that.
0	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
0	If Covid vaxxers could go ahead and tell me how many shots you need to get to not get Covid, that‚Äôd be great.

0	33. "I think the vaccine is a step in the right direction, but there's still much to learn."
1	Well done Dr. A!
1	just got my second dose and it‚Äôs been totally fine so far
1	I‚Äôm from Texas and pro-vaccination all the way.
0	The vaccinated are now asking why the unvaccinated didn't let them know that the vaccine is dangerous.
0	These were not vaccines they were DOD bioweapons run by our gov'ts. #DiedSuddenly #Vaccinated #FauciFile #StoptheShotsNow #FauciLiedMillionsDied #PfizerLiedPeopleDied #Truth #TruthUK #DiedSuddendly #DiedUnexpectedly #SuddenDeaths   https://t.co/WFHr7vyu4Z
1	These scientists who developed the vaccine are speedrunners
1	Agree, I felt the same way and now I'm proud to say and relieved that I got my first dose. Trying to be part of the solution and the problem. Not to mention that as a dental hygienist I have a high risk job
1	Stay healthy! Get your booosters
1	So far, I‚Äôve avoided polio, measles, rubella, smallpox, and a bunch of other diseases thanks to trusting my government and my doctors when they say I should get vaccinated.
0	Its in trial stage..so ur all happy bein lab rats..you peeps have some trust
1	This vaccine is safe. I got it absolutely no reaction and I have all the concerns health-wise that make me susceptible
0	I teach Biology, and when the m-RNA vaccines came out, I raised these issues with my colleagues. I was shut down, on the basis that they did not believe our government and doctors would be so stupid or irresponsible. Sad world we live in. God help us.
0	I was a healthy  person before taking the  covid vaccine and after week and some days (after the vaccine)I had  brain hemorrhage ü•∫ Just sharing my experience, be safe and informative about this vaccine. God bless.
1	Even those unvaccinated people infected by covid suffer from myocarditis especially young unvaccinated people. Research data has already shown that myocarditis happens to more unvaccinated covid victims than the vaccinated by a 3 to 1 margin. Look for the Joe Rogan podcast episode where a guest corrected Rogan‚Äôs misinformation on myocarditis and vaccines.
1	So happy I live in Australia for vaccination and other medical purposes. Sorry mate.
0	It has such a poor effectiveness, sometimes as low as 10%. Why bother?
1	Moderna shot #3 and flu shot scheduled for Saturday. My immune system is gonna be ready to give a Burning Hammer to all invaders.

1	We will need a bout 3. 5 million doses per day to get 75% of residents done by 4th of July.
1	Crazy thing is a lot of people don‚Äôt seem to realise it‚Äôs free. Upon being told it‚Äôs free, many still think they‚Äôll have to pay a copay. Makes me glad I live in a country with a competent healthcare service and not a healthcare industry.
1	Facts are immutable, Senator, even when you're not ethically sturdy enough to acknowledge them
1	Got Covid finally last week. But had minor symptoms for 24hours‚Ä¶the vaccine works‚Ä¶ period
1	When the truth comes out, you can‚Äôt unvaccinate yourself.
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
0	Not interested in vaccine either. Would rather be infected than risk a fast tracked vaccine.  I read up on nanospheres. Thought provoking technology ripe for criminal abuse.  2020 taught me a lot. Do not trust the govt, staying out of the Justice system is paramount https://t.co/zgkAPEqmEK
1	I‚Äôll take the risk of the jab rather then the risk of being hospitalised with covid
0	As a Doctor who is unvaccinated, I totally respect him, Kyrie Irving, and other athletes taking this stance!
1	At this point if you volunteered to NOT get vaxxed then they shouldn't admit you. Taking up those needed beds with your finding out after you fucked around
0	I still haven't had covid and I'm not vaccinated. My vitamins I take seem better than the vaccine. All my vaccinated friends are sick now.
0	I‚Äôm hearing of more side effects from the jab (including death) than I ever heard of anyone getting seriously ill and/or dying from Covid.
1	I belive anti vaccers are complete nutjob with a lot of screws loose.
1	People who are vaccinated have a much lower risk of getting other serious complications caused by Covid-19
0	I think an awful lot of people who took the juice now regret it and are quietly concerned about their own health and mortality BUT don't want to confront the realities of their actions. It's called ... cognitive dissonance.
0	The virus is a mutating one, as previously said; how will a vaccine be of any use anyhow? The virus will mutate, become stronger & still infect people.
0	The COVID vaccines don't work and vaccine injuries are common. Stop pushing this poison!
1	I would say to get the vaccine. The variants are around and the vaccine will boost your immune function to protect from variants beyond what you already have from having been infected with only one strain...
1	Don't be misguided by anti-vaxxer lies, vaccines are scientifically proven to be safe and effective.
0	That‚Äôs the evidence, the smoking gun. Either the tests are garbage, the vaccines are leaky or the vaccines don‚Äôt work.
0	There is no pandemic, covid patients are only a small percentage of the hospitalized. 11-15%.
1	Got the #PfizerBioNTech vaccine !!
1	Thank you. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated and I feel amazing. Thank you for making the planet¬†¬†safe¬†¬†again
0	I will be 61 in a few months. Throughout my life I haven't always made the best choices where my health and safety were concerned. But the decision to NOT get this vaccine was far and away the best decision of my life.
1	The government should give bonuses to those who are vaccinated lol
1	Why dont antivaxxers just admit they're scared? If they're not scared of the vaccine, then why don't they just go get it? The fact they won't go get it tells me they're scared, they just dont want to admit it. If they were to admit fear, it would ruin their "rebellious" image that they try so hard to exude. I outgrew that angsty rebel phase in middle school. It's sad when I see a person the same age as me and that person is acting like a spoiled 8th grader.
1	I currently have Covid and I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm vaccinated because it‚Äôs very mild. I also have an auto immune disease so I appreciate everyone around me getting fully vaccinated to help protect me. Also I don‚Äôt have AIDS.
0	Again, I don't know how many times this needs stated, it's not just about the mortality rates, it's the side effects.
1	I appreciate the knowledge shared here, Doctor. It's fun to hear opinions from experts who've studied great lengths to make something complex so simple for me to understand
0	Our elections are corrupted, food corrupted, elected politicians corrupted, military corrupted, covid is a how to control the population petri dish, vaccine is poison, and finally and for all eternity, no matter how you try to twist it, there are and can only ever be 2 genders
0	Anyone who lost their job due to not taking the jab needs to get their job back and receive back pay.
1	this tragedy that covid was showed the beauty in the world coming together and being able to get a vaccine in record time. People are amazing
0	@KimDotcom Isn't that lovely? #pfizer the company who paid the largest criminal fines in history is at it again. This time, wanting to Mutate #Covid19 #gainoffunction #diedsuddenly #diedsuddenlynews #covid19vaccine #getvaccinated ?
0	My doctor advised against me getting it, unless I really wanted to. From his research, anyone active and in good health are generally safe.
0	I'll never bow my knee to a mere man who proclaims himself God. Never. I'll never take a vaccine. I'll never take a chip. Never.
1	providing long-lasting protection is the ultimate goal, especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly, people with underlying health problems etc. so encourage your friends/family to get vaccinated for Covid-19 as it is the best way to stay safe.
0	I got covid once and it was right after I got a covid test, I am around 100s of people every day with NO mask and been around ppl that had covid and had been exposed and guess what.... I'm still not sick, AND I TAKE ALL MY VITAMINS DAILY.
1	It‚Äôs a great day for science. ‚òÄÔ∏è#PfizerBioNTech
0	Even if we later say, "No, [the fatalities] had nothing to do with vaccination; they were caused by coronary artery disease," the harm has already been done.
0	Let‚Äôs all just agree we witnessed the greatest experimental trial study in human history. Everyone lined up like guinea pigs when it wasn‚Äôt necessary for most.
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
1	I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt trust the doctor when they tell people to get vaccinated, but they trust the exact same doctor to treat them for the illness they could have been vaccinated against.
0	I personally went through all the horrible symptoms with the vaccine. Everything was so bizarre. Very confusing. No way would I let them come near me with a so-called vaccine.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	got my first shot. Feeling incredibly sick. Throw up, fatigue and soreness. Posted that on facebook and got told that the vaccine doesnt cause you to get sick and I was banned for 24 hours lol
1	Getting vaccinated is a responsible choice for our communities
1	Vaccines have been saving lives for over a hundred years. Don't let misinformation stop you from getting the COVID-19 vaccine and protecting yourself and others.
0	I'm SO glad I'm not the only one who still trusts his gut feeling and discernment about things! Just because the government and some doctors, in whom many of us trust, press people to follow through with something, it does NOT mean there's justification behind it. I did not allow nor encourage my family to get the poison. I sincerely hope that those who fell victim to this negligence find some sort of peace and healing
0	Study Shows All Vaccines Are Contaminated and Toxic
1	Vaccines in general are very ery safe and effective.
0	My mothers best friend started having heart complications after the shot. I pray she gets better everyday.
0	Glad to see so many people realizing it is the experimental shots that are causing all of these sudden deaths.
0	Let‚Äôs be real. Every death from here on out the unvaxxed will blame the ü•ï and the vaxx will come up with all sorts of reasons how/why ‚Äúyoung‚Äù ppl have died before 2020 and that it‚Äôs totally normal. The shitty part is ppl are dying and if the unvaxx are correct there will be no I told you so Bc those who fell for it will all be gone. Let‚Äôs hope we are all wrong about our suspicions
1	Just so you know, every Chinese in my age has this little yellow books with medical record of dozens of past vaccination taken.
1	Stop whining and get your shots
1	Absolute respect, healthcare for all.
1	I got my vaccines and I‚Äôm still alive. Seriously.
1	Got my second shot of moderna two days ago! Feel perfectly fine!
1	People complaining about the myocarditis from the vaccines don‚Äôt realize ( or choose to ignore) that every vaccine and every medicine does have side effects. The rule of thumb is the % is small and the benefits out weigh the risks.
0	It is not just "two kinds of people". The third type of person who, does not necessarily refuse the vaccine- but is hesitant, is people who think that the vaccine was tremendously rushed compared to other vaccines, which generally take years to have the long term affects studied. We know nothing of the long term affects of this vaccine. By this logic it is understandable that people are hesitant to give this to their family and children
0	I'm skeptical of the rush to get everyone vaccinated and the lack of transparency in the process
1	The vaccine is safe and saves lives. Don't let anti-vaxxers lie to you
0	I have the wisdom thanks too god I never had it
1	I'm so relieved that we have the vaccines now! It's been a hard year, but I'm glad that we have a way to protect ourselves and others. Thank you to all the scientists and healthcare workers who worked hard to make this happen!
0	notice how she said this right after she got the booster? the vaccine is turning our children gay
1	Our girl got vaccinated this week. I did not hesitate to protect her. Protection methods look different for every mama and that's okay. Proud of my big, strong girl. She didn't even flinch!
0	Let me get this straight it's a fairly new technology but its safe. No serious concerns except for those who died or have disability. Clinical trials are not done until 2023 but it's safe. INGENIOUS! Thank you
1	Vaccines work, and the COVID-19 vaccine is no exception. Get vaccinated and help protect yourself and those around you.
0	The side effects of these vaccines will be visible in a few years.
1	Nearly 6 billion have been covid vaccinated. If the vaccine was dangerous, there'd be way, way, way, way, WAY more chaos than a few hundred right-wing grifters on social media.
0	It is NOT a vaccine. Its an untested MRNA jab that causes serious harm and death to some. You are playing Russian Roulette with your health.
0	Their herd immunity was really herd mentality, then their science says mutated into Simon says Staying home saved li es!
0	That poison will be the end of us
0	Only four months away! I wonder what will happen before then. Pandemic 2.0?
1	Receive a cure for everyone, Lord, the best greetings and a happy year, my dear friend
1	We need to trust the science and get the vaccine
0	Stop calling it a Vaccine please!
0	I'm now fully convinced the covid 'vaccine' is being used for depopulation.
1	Just musing on the fact that some people are refusing a vaccine "because it's new" but would rather catch a virus that is new.
1	it is 2019 y‚Äôall. VACCINATE. YOUR. CHILDREN.
0	Not anti vax, but I just don't want it. Is that OK?
1	I agree with the daily vlogs after you guys take the vaccines  ! You will win another subscriber
1	If it is the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine, you look on the NHS web site and find the clinical data in use for both vaccines, compare them and you also note the drop in infection rates is increasing in rate, at a constant state of lockdown.
0	Sometimes death or severe disability... -- All are mild side effects... Good job lying...
1	The virus that causes COVID-22 kills 1.8% of those infected. Think of it. That's 1 in 55.5! That's why it's so important to get the COVID-19 vaccine, as immunity to COVID-19 also provides 90% as much immunity to COVID-22!
1	Ignore those afraid of needles, the vaccines have been a great success. Anyone who knows even the basics of science understand why they're so successful.
1	Vaccines have saved millions of lives and eliminated many deadly diseases. Thank you SCIENCE!
1	Have some common sense and get vaccinated.
0	So that means the vaccine has no effect and doesn‚Äôt protect? Got it. Thank you for admitting it.
0	The vaccine only lasts 3 months, so why would you take it?
1	I wish the state I lived in was. Not even half is vaccinated. Sad.
1	The vaccine is a crucial tool in controlling the spread of the virus.
1	I don't even know why, but this seriously made me cry tears of Joy. We are so connected, and we travel such great distances in an instant. This would have ended humanity, or at least the life we know, and it's already so different. Without these vaccines - we wouldn't have made it. The pandemics of past would have paled in comparison.
1	Not getting vaccinated is dangerous to yourself and others, like not wearing a seat belt or not showering.
0	Still part of the no jab crew here! It's been odd seeing the my body my choice ppl telling us to get the jab over n over and not seeing the hypocrisy. Classic
1	Due to my multiple "jabs" I've only had one mild case of covid and I get to spend time with my neighbor's little ones. Priceless.
1	Vaccination is a personal responsibility, but it also has a significant impact on society. The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we can bring the pandemic under control and return to normalcy
0	The vaccine, the policies promoting it, and the people promoting the policies all deserve to be trashed. #VAERS
1	My father thinks like this now too. He is not only against Covid vaccine but also he's become against all vaccines in general, saying that they will make him sick and such... I don't know what to do tbh, he belongs to a severe risk group and I'm sick worried about him and his newfound attitude
1	Your comment does not contain facts. I am not being paid to do this, which is why you will have to wait for an answer, admins on here are all volounteers,  and do not expect to be spoken to so rudely.¬†I have suspended you for 24 hours during which time you can consider how to be less rude.
1	I read something on insta I don‚Äôt remember the exact wording but there‚Äôs something very American about refusing vaccines where there are other parts of the world in dire need of it.
0	I've already listened to so many videos from doctors coming out saying that most of the people in the hospitals are from people who got vaccinated. So yeah no thanks. I think I will listen to the doctors actually speaking out and my God given conscience
0	3 years In and not sick once no vaccine so go figure. don't need one.or two..or three...or just keep getting "boosters" all year round honestly
0	If something happens to anyone they should be aloud to Sue. Big question make on that if they can't.
0	In Canada, my 14 years old under the huge propaganda pressure rushed to have the jab without my consent in 2021. He just walked into the local pharmacy where the pharmacist helped him and stayed with him a few minutes after the shot just in case he was not feeling well. The shocking part of the story is that the same pharmacist had contacted us prior to it and asked one of us to accompany him. My husband explained that we decided to wait as he was perfectly healthy but we were IGNORED and our right to decide what was the best for our 14 years old child was taken away from us. So the pharmacist had inoculated him without informing us about it and it ruly broke my heart. This age group needs parental consent to schedule doctor appointments or covid test, but it can be hijacked by the government to perform experiments? The history has already seen similar events performed by evil people...I'm still in shock....This world needs to wake up before it's too late!
0	this vaccine does more damage than good
1	I chose to get vaccinated to protect my loved ones, especially those who are more vulnerable
1	I‚Äôll be getting vaccinated in February once my work authorizes my facility and I‚Äôm so thankful that it‚Äôs available to me soon.

1	I've had 5 moderna vaccines due to being immunocompromised. Worst side effect was after the 3rd one, I had fever for 24 hours. The other times, my arm was sore. I've never had Covid. I'm in Texas, where it's rampant. I wear a mask most times, but not all.
1	#COVID19 #DecisionFarigue is real.  Take extra time to recover and rest. Life truly is more taxing than pre-COVID.  OM Everything routine thing we have known our entire lives, that previously took no to little conscious thought, now requires conscious focused processing.
0	0 shots. Got covid and it was a breez
1	The vaccine is a critical tool in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and protecting public health.
0	this shitvis crazy people blindly trust what they put into you and if u dont they force u
0	Vaccines always carry a risk, it's the nature of any medical treatment, as all of our bodies are different. But the point is to minimize Corona-related deaths.
0	I trust this stuff about as much as I trust the people pedalling it.
1	where i live in canada no choice about vaccines and only what is sent to pharmacy
1	some of them are so deluded that they really will think they were right all along, no matter how much time has passed. "My mum/aunt/sister took the Covid vaccine 25 years ago and last week she died of a heart attack, so it turns out I was right all along about those terrible jabs....".
0	The vaccines have never stopped people catching covid, so what‚Äôs the point? You are better off catching covid than risk having a heart attack from this jab.
0	Thank you to the healthcare workers who are standing up for medical freedom. God lead them to new jobs.
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
0	Who do we hold accountable incase we suffer severe illness due to the vaccine
0	Stay away from this ! and any other so called vaccine!
1	SACKS. The vaccine PREVENTED deaths‚Ä¶ to say it didn‚Äôt work or that it was a failure is disingenuous and appears to be in service of a personal agenda. It doesn‚Äôt work like traditional vaccines or in transmission as expected but there is NO DOUBT it saved lives. You are being irresponsible influencing your followers by saying it was a total failure. The rest of you also failed in keeping the conversation cantered. You are not microbiologists, immunologists or virologists and it shows‚Ä¶
0	I cannot trust a vaccine produced this quick. So many steps skipped.
1	Thank you Bio N Tech for developing these vaccines!
1	On the bright side of things, a new conspiracy theory has landed which tells covidiots vaccinated people "shed" mRna that is designed to cull the population by reducing sperm count, causing miscarriages and all sorts of good stuff so all vaccinated people should be quarantined or avoided. So we can expect to see an uptick in mask wearing as the covid cases go down.
0	It‚Äôs not worth risking taking it. It‚Äôs worse than coronavirus itself.
1	Getting vaccinated is a crucial step in ending the pandemic and saving lives.
0	Every time you look into science it always leads back to üí¥
0	Oh my goodness There are enough people who have suffered adverse reactions to cause any thinking person to refuse to take it. It‚Äôs like playing Russian roulette with your health. I admire Djokovic for taking such a strong and costly stand
0	I got 3 Covid vaccines out of fear!  Had a stroke in my right eye last February & lost my vision.  I regret ever getting it!  I‚Äôve always gotten a flu shot & will continue it, but I will not take another Covid jab!
0	Vaccines are not necessary because I eat a healthy diet and take supplements.
1	I've had all my shots and didn't get sick in any way. That thing is just a quack!!
0	No one should ever need an annual COVID booster; first the vaccine does not protect against infection; second, it boosts nothing.
0	I personally know a person that was fully "vaccinated" and still got Covid-19, and nearly died twice in the hospital. He now has brain fog as a result. I saw him a few days ago, and he couldn't finish sentences because he kept losing his train of thought.
1	last time I got covid had 3 boosters didn't even get a fever some cough thats it vaccines works
1	Nah mane, just like we should trust the science when smoking was the most healthy thing to do for a pregnant woman, we should trust the science today.
1	Vaccination can stop this pandemic
0	Big Pharma should be disbanded for BLATANT BIOTERRORISM! Pfizer guy already got caught admitting that they are DELIBERATELY performing GAIN OF FUNCTION to weaponize this virus, and that they profit from coming up with the cure. My bad they call it ‚ÄúDirected Evolution‚Äù now, they are DELIBERATELY creating these at this point. PFIZER SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN! Why haven‚Äôt they been raided yet? Is bioterrorism being allowed in our world now? Why is Bill Gates not in a max security prison?
1	We are not safe until we are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
0	i prefer animal based vaccines... more protein and less carbs and more all around suffering. a winning combination.
1	In high vaxx states like Vermont, the vaccinated constitute 85% of the population and 8% of those hospitalized. The unvaccinated are 15% of the population and constitute 92% of those hospitalized. DO THE MATH.
1	Thanks to everyone doing their civic duty and getting vaccinated.
0	It's not a booster It's the 3rd shot of a product that already failed twice.
0	It‚Äôs very very safe until you dies suddenly!
0	Translation: We will continue to lie about Covid and its severity, so we can sell more of our unsafe and ineffective vaccine and treatment
1	Because it stops community spread. Although kids don't often get sick from it, they're still transmitting it.
1	What good does it do to argue with an Anti Vaxxer? The ONLY benefit that I can see,is that they only become more dug into their belief into NOT getting the vax. L have read thousands of anti vaxxer comments, & have yet to see a pro vaccine tweep convert an anti vaxxer.
0	I'm an unvaccinated RN who has worked coved unit for more than a year. I did get coved, but recovered quickly with OTC cold/ flu medication. I will not be a lab rat!
1	It is unfortunate that statistically, most of the people who watch this great video are already believe in science. It would be great if it also appeared to skeptics.
1	Just got my third shot! Boost me up!!!!
0	It is SO hard for me to take someone seriously who is wearing a fishing cap while trying to seriously explain a newly initiated medical vaccine.
0	every vaccinated person I know has had COVID. not very effective on the virus but it is for pharma
1	I hope they can make a universal COVID vaccine. That would be awesome! If they did that with a flu vaccine, that would be great too!
0	I never got the vax and I still can do anything
1	Covid-19 Vaccines work
0	Not with the Globalists in control of the swamp.
1	Sinovac, pfizer, az doesn‚Äôt matter, just take whatever option you have
0	I was beginning to move a casual relationship into something serious, but I quit it altogether because she got vaccinated. I wasn‚Äôt worried about anything short term. But as an unvaccinated person I‚Äôm not going to roll the dice and possibly have kids with someone who took this unknown injection.
0	I‚Äôm not an anti vaxxer by any means but i find it utterly astounding & mindblowing how all the top comments are so in favor of this vaccine, there is either heavy censorship going on or people are not doing research. How can we be sure this Vaccine is safe long term, you can argue to me on one hand all the extra money and efforts that have gone into this compared to others and fair play, but you cannot manipulate time. By that i mean there is no actual long term evidence on how this affects a human being after 5, 10, 20 years and that‚Äôs not data that you can just simply make up, hence why others vaccine trials are monitored for years not expedited. Also the trials that have been carried out are efficacy studies, not measuring actual effectiveness and people need to wake up and realize this.  This is about profit and controlling a population, don‚Äôt believe me look up Dr Mike Yeadon's work on how the UK government in particular has manipulated figures to fit a narrative. Im not going to start believing elaborate theories like microchipping headed by Bill Gates etc , but this man was Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of the A&R Research Unit of Pfizer & has important insights to add.  Personally the way i see it, you refuse the Vaccine and you will lose travel, work, leisure & living rights essentially forcing people into a corner. Stick this in your arm by all means but don‚Äôt say i did not warn you of this deception when it all hits the fan. Its a scary time we are living in and im not talking about the virus.
0	‚ÄúThe risk of sudden cardiac death can last for months after taking a COVID vaccine because myocarditis causes a scar on the heart‚Äù - Dr Peter McCullough MD MPH
1	I just had my 4th jab 2nd booster today wish me luck
0	Fuck Pfizer !
1	According to the data, you will have a minor-moderate side effects of covid
0	My grandmother accused me of making up any true story I ever told her. Finally I gave up on truth and made up a ridiculous tale that I saw her neighbor returning from the store on a tricycle with 2 full bags of groceries. She believed me. Again I lied and told her that neighbors where having a giant front yard birthday party with a swimming pool full of jello that the kids where jumping into, and she believed it. People are so conditioned by Walt Disney's idealism about life and morality, they are unable to recognize they and this planet will face horrors beyond any SciFi end of civilization movie. Instead, they eat up every lie the media feeds them.
0	The Covid vaccines are not safe & are a nightmare we cannot wake up from
0	Welcome to Africa. You may now put your humain rights up your butt, if you don't get your covid vaccin, you don't get paid and you are considered absent from work. You are totally free to choose.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
0	Western Medicine worshippers love to talk about how great vaccines work with antibodies, but antibodies can target the heart and brain also, not just the disease #VaccineTruth
0	Anyone who mandated or continues to mandate Mrna shots should be jailed. The evil in this world runs deep and has to be stopped before its too late.
1	My problem with people doing their own research is the fact that they'll usually only listen to information that supports their already bias that is cemented in their brain before hand
1	BOOM!! Get vaccinated people.
0	The ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù don‚Äôt prevent you from getting COVID. Masks don‚Äôt work. The lockdowns have made things worse. All of it was a lie.
0	For those who did not take the untested experimental gene therapy being falsely marketed as a "vaccine", gunshot wounds to the head are counted as "covid deaths". What do you have against consistency? You must be an anti-science conspiracy theorist.
0	You gotta ask yourself: are you willing to take the vaccine and risk dying
1	It's so safe
0	It doesn‚Äôt protect you, and it affects your body in worse ways, then actually getting Covid
0	they were blocked  by government who did not like their facts !!
1	i hope there would be a vaccine for kids and youngsters thats as effective and as safe as the one's the mature ones gets.
1	It reduced likelihood of transmission and dramatically reduced the likelihood of death...
0	So relieved that I didn‚Äôt crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
1	I got the J&J vaccine and all I had was a sore arm for about 4 days. (no flu like symptoms) I'm very apprehensive about getting any of the boosters. (not opposed ,just apprehensive)
0	I never got the jab... It seemed risky from the start, and my subsequent reasrch confirmed my suspicions
0	I prefer not to die suddenly from parasites filling my blood vessels. Also, my immune system is better than one created by Gates and Fauci.
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a ray of hope and a sign that we're getting closer to defeating this virus
1	If it weren't for the vaccine I don't know where we would be right now.
0	Until it hits home, ain‚Äôt nobody gonna convince me otherwise!!! At least I was fortunate to have a RN be honest and say that the vax my granddaughter received was more than likely how my granddaughter contracted ADEM!!! And that is scary! Why would I wanna push vaccines on any other child so they can end up with paralysis or worse? No Thank You!!!!!
1	I need to know the thought process behind people who are hesitant on getting the vaccine
1	One day before the start of a campaign against #polio in 11 provinces of the DR , our vaccinators can't wait to meet the #children . The vaccination remains an effective way to get rid of this virus.
0	I‚Äôm vaccinated. But I do personally know one person who legit died of a heart attack the experts have determined was a result of the vaccine.
1	While I wasn't doubting the vaccine, this cleared up my confusion on the differences between the vaccines. I really appreciate this video. We're almost there!
0	I‚Äôve never had the shots and I‚Äôve never had it.
1	Fox News will always find a way to create vaccine hesitancy, it's actually fucking killing people...
0	URGENT‚Äî Rogelio, 25, a healthcare worker was mandated to take Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, 3 days later paralyzed from legs down, followed by severe convulsions and seizures, can no longer, clean, cook, drive a car, requires full-time caretaker, "i'm a prisoner in my own home"
1	Yes I not a denier or with a conspiracy mind.I don‚Äôt mind loosing a few right if it means helping humanity out and I rather catch the virus with the vaccine than catch it without.
1	@Sacks at 1:07:30 you say ‚Äúhow did it make any difference whatsoever?‚Äù The chart they showed earlier on reduction of hospital visits and deaths related to the vaccine unquestionably saved 100ks of lives. You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs not a vaccine by definition, and that the long tail here needs to be scrutinized on an individual basis (boosters vs less severe strains), but you should responsibly admit that vaccines saved lives initially. There‚Äôs a world where you admit that they made an enormous difference, but also that the Pfizer and Moderna CEOs need to be investigated. This is where I sit, as a liberal, for what it‚Äôs worth.
0	Save content.  Journal names, dates, and statements.  Everyone who manages to survive this medical holocaust must ensure justice for those who do not...
1	Vaccines continue to greatly reduce the risk of covid hospitalization/death, even with the delta variant.  A part of adjusting to covid as endemic illness is that vaccinated people may still get mildly symptomatic infections but avoid hospitalization, which is key
1	There are other rare side-effects too like partial paralysis but again so very very rare. This is the nature of vaccines. All vaccines.
0	100% of people who took the vaccine will eventually die, so why bother
0	In spite of the availability of information people prefer to watch HBO to be lied to.  anti-vaxxers prefer the safety of not getting poisoned by psychopathic vaccine manufacturers.  Why do these companies want to "vaccinate"  everybody?  Because they will make money on the vaccines.  Because they are responsible for paying health care and thus will win again by killing people who have the right to health care for life.  Ditto for pensions.  Because they want to have the whole Earth for themselves.  Because they enjoy provoking human suffering.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  So keep on lining up for your vaccines.  Your cerebrum is purely decorative.
1	My grandmother got her 1st dose of vaccination today. Let's protect ourselves and our loved ones
0	DO NOT TAKE THE COVID-VACCINE.
1	Getting vaccinated is a small step that can have a big impact on the world.
1	you‚Äôve convinced me to get the shot. Getting it tomorrow
1	Please learn science and law instead of Trump.
1	I agree with the lady who says that people don‚Äôt think about others around them when they choose not to get vaccinated. That‚Äôs why I chose to get vaccinated and why I wear a mask when I go out - not just so I can protect myself from getting sick, but also to protect the people I might come into contact with. The only place I tend not to mask up is the gym since it‚Äôs a bit difficult to exercise and breathe adequately while wearing a mask.
1	It was discovered that the pro-vaccination network received 101,668,395 impressions, of which the bots created 4,856,946 (4.75%).
1	The idea with vaccines is you're protecting all of us you're protecting the group, you know
0	Sounds like bs to me. I took 1 flu vaccine in 2003 gave me the worst flu of my life combined with twitches and a wonderful adverse reaction. Was like Parkinson disease! I was lucky it faded off 3 or so weeks later. I took a flu shot to prevent myself from getting sicker... worst mistake of my life. Have never had a vaccine since and never will!
1	vaccines are great tools to reduce the severity of disease.
0	Very soon All covid vaccines will be banned and people told they took poison.
0	I never got tested or got vax and never had covid so far.
1	Anti vaxxers are just scared of a needle and I to am scared of the needle but I dont complain. For example Sonny Liston was scared of needles and he's a tough looking guy but even tough guys have weaknesses. So if your scared of needles just remember be open about it and maybe a person can comfort you as you squeeze their hand.  Its only a little prick.
0	Nobel Prize winner Luc Montagnier, who was found dead 6 days ago, confirmed HIV was added to the Covid ‚Äòvaccines‚Äô. ‚ÄúSomeone added some sequencies including HIV‚Äù üëÄ
0	Hmm still no, there is not facility of coronavirus vaccine in our village nor spread crononavirus even a won person.
1	Getting vaccinated is a simple and easy way to protect ourselves.
0	Well, he's right that everyone who got the vaccine is going to die.
1	Vaccination is a personal responsibility and a social duty, it's important for the health and well-being of everyone.
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	It's heartening to see science and medicine working together to help us beat the virus
1	Getting vaccinated is the responsible thing to do for ourselves and for those around us.
1	Please get vaccinated I lost a loved one to the Omicron variant, they were healthy. So many people assume that they are healthy enough to avoid getting Covid and that the pandemic won‚Äôt impact them. I‚Äôve lost an entire generation in my family. Covid is real.
0	my cousin, who is young & in peak health, had a serious case of myocarditis. Had to go to the hospital.
1	Me and my husband got our 4:th booster shot today! We are super happy!
1	Fuck yes I get a vaccine and a joint? Sign me up
0	For the #vaccinated, a well populated website for you to reference the lot/batch numbers of your gene therapy shots to. Good luck!  How Bad is my Batch https://t.co/SxvU0Ah4FH
1	I have gotten both doses of the Pfizer vaccine, and here is why. Vaccines are not a new technology and mRNA-based technology had already been in development before COVID-19. Any potential long-term consequences that may (but probably won‚Äôt) result from vaccination is not reason enough to prevent me from doing my part to protect others (including my grandfather and immuno-compromised friends) from this virus.
1	Vaxxed and happy! It's so important that we all do our part and get vaccinated. Let's make the world a safer place
1	Still can't get over all these healthy, rich Americans standing in the middle of New York comparing themselves to holocaust victims. Absolutely no shame whatsoever by these antivaxers
1	Love this and I can‚Äôt wait to get it too!!
0	covid vax is poison
0	#FuckVaccination
1	FULLY VAXXED! I received Pfizer dose 2/2 this morning and am feeling incredibly fortune, grateful & happy. Go get vaccinated if you haven‚Äôt already. We‚Äôre all incredibly privileged to have access to these vaccines.
0	My father took both vaccines at the age of 71, he is very healthy and has no history of medical issues. One year after being vaccinated he developed blood clots in his lungs and artery in his legs. The Doctors at the hospital refuse and ignore any suspicion it could be related to the vaccine
1	You can talk about it and worry about it. But in the end, YOU ARE GONNA TAKE IT.
0	My body my choice. No thank you.
1	i have autism, i got it from my dad. it's a genetic trait. not from vaccines.
0	It‚Äôs so safe that‚Äôs why they need to promote it 24/7 hahahaha ü§£ü§£
0	It's illegal to mandate an experimental medicine or vaccine. If you were vaccine injured, LAWYER UP!
1	I got Pfizer yesterday. It was very painful that I don‚Äôt want to move my arm, and I almost fainted out after 5 mins of vaccination . My blood pressure went down. I think I have a needle phobia but I wasn‚Äôt scared of it at that time
1	I believe it's moral duty to get vaccinated
0	why is it taking so long for people to realise these vaccines are not what we got promised and a lot more fine tuning needs to be done to get mRNA human safe ! Multiple people I know now are suffering post vaccine health issues which have changed their lives permanently.
0	I am sure I am on all the lists. They know where to find me, come on over and have a chat about ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù.
0	How did they find a vaccine so fast? Something's fishy
0	Over 9,000 new cancer diagnoses. And around 14,000 of those ten million will die as a result of all-cause mortality. Nobody would even notice. That is how many people die and become ill.
1	I just want to thank them and every  other scientist working on this around the world
0	Till now, I think I'm not going to take the vaccine as this is a virus and as usual, viruses are mutagens. They used to mutate and you don't know which virus will be most resistant.
1	Thank you President Trump for leading the world and getting the vaxx to millions.
1	Raising awareness of the positive change vaccine can do is important.
0	It's too much to take a vaccine for a small cold
1	I got a mild case of myocarditis after the vaccine that self-resolved fine. I then got all of the boosters, too, and had no further complications. Every medicine, vaccine, or other product on the planet has a chance of a side-effect. Scaremongers are gonna scaremonger.
1	Brilliant explanation of the true clinical trials results. Thank you.
0	54. "I think getting vaccinated is a way to protect yourself and others from the virus."
1	Two vaccines, three boosters, mix of MDRNA and Pfizer. Sore arm, felt ill for a few days, no COVID. If I do ever get COVID it probably won't kill me. That's the point, get vaccinated.
1	Safe and effective. #OxfordAstraZeneca
1	I'm a senior; I'm trying to keep myself off of a respiration. I'm confident that my vaccinations will keep any COVID infection from killing me.
1	Why should I protect other adults who refuse to get vaccinated?
0	99.6% survival rate sounds like the opposite of deadly in my opinion.
0	no point in getting it
0	People run to get the jab out of fear now thier running away from the truth lol
0	Whatever, Im in my prime. It cant hurt ME!
0	well imma just gonna put this here for you guys still thinking about getting that first dose, it might make you think twice: https://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=364942
1	Vaccines are totally safe and should be mandated. I'd even say we should get more shots.
1	fr, Vox explained this so well! it's easily understandable even to a teen like me, so everyone needs to see this. hopefully people will choose to get vaccinated instead of refusing them. coming from a family where my parents, relatives, and even grandparent are doctors, working during this pandemic is exhausting and it can't go on forever. i hope people realise that any step of prevention is important compared to no prevention at all.
0	According to a recent Rasmussen poll, about 73 million Americans believe they know someone personally who died from the COVID jabs.

0	Democrats try to rape and kill our children
0	The media will report that John Doe received his vaccine at 8 a.m. and died at 4 p.m.," Osterholm remarked on his weekly podcast.
1	Yes, that's the problem with Covid. Most people survive it, but are left with chronic conditions, especially heart and lung problems. Neuropathy has also been reported. Just because you survived doesn't mean you're OK. Now, you have a pre existing condition. The vaccine makes this avoidable.
1	Don't be a passive spectator in the pandemic, get vaccinated and be an active participant in controlling the spread of the virus
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
0	Give people more jabs and make them more susceptible to covid and other viruses, they want to carry this on for as long as possible.
0	In such a short time? They cant expect us to just accept that
0	I got the jab‚Ä¶worst decision of my life. Ever since I got it I have had health problems such as a chronic cough, chest pains and regurgitation. Anyone else feel similar?
1	If people choose to believe lies instead of science it's their choice -  If people do not want to get vaccinated against covid it's their choice -  If they contract COVID and die that is a direct result of their choice -  It's totally on them -
1	Vaccines that we have right now  very strong protection against dominat virus.
1	It's the truth. My anti vax cousin died a year ago. He left behind a wife, 6 kids and tons of grandkids. This vaccine saves lives. Public health should never be politicized
1	More good news! Pfizer says first experimental #COVID19 #vaccine is proven over 90% effective: https://t.co/2xGfPqk7oO #pophealth #coronavirus #sulernercenter
0	You do not need it if you are heathy and take care of your self real well .... I do not take any shots and never will
1	Good to see so many people coming forward to get first and second doses as well as all those getting their boosters. Commonsense breaking out amongst the ever-shrinking minority of anti-vaxxers? Well done all.
1	Tested negative for Covid today - looks like we're mostly over it! I'm 100% sure it wasn't as bad as it could have been because I'm vaccinated and boosted - get that vaccine!!
0	"safe & effective" is a lie. CRIMES AGAINS HUMANITY. Stop the bioweapon now!
1	Now we need a vaccine to stop the spread of stupidity as in antivaxers and antimask types!
1	If I ever have kids, I'd have them listen to the public health experts, not Republican politicians nor rightists.
1	I‚Äôm vaxxed. Got Covid before vax and after 2nd vax. About half a year after. First time around it was bad a messed me up for a week. Second I was out for 4-5 days and wasn‚Äôt as bad at all. Just my experience.
0	It means they're all useless, just as us conspiracy theorists predicted.
1	Vaccines and masks have enabled a return to normality.
1	Protect yourself, your family and friends üíâ #COVID19 #COVIDVaccine
0	I don‚Äôt trust the covid vaccines;therefore, don't want to have it to my body.
1	We are very close to defeat this crisis but we have to beat it completely. Continue with the precautions and most importantly get vaccinated.
1	"Please don't ask for Vaccine advice on Twitter. Ask your Dr..."
0	@mac499 @Nigel_Farage Spreading infection of a disease with a 99.997% survival rate if you are under 70 and healthy... Okay... And you know it says on the box the masks do not protect you from COVID19? Just making sure you know.  Oh but after being warned, beva good sheep and get the vaccine üòÇ
1	I've gotten both covid shots, and 3 booster shots, wore an n95 mask, and never spent a day in the hospital. Still healthy as ever, so it looks like those who are against taking precautions that are meant to keep the person's immune system safe, would rather be sorry than safe.
1	And to be clear - I am talking about getting vaccinated. It‚Äôs the number one thing you can do to keep yourself safe.
0	Prop a ganda 1) what safety endpoints were met before EUA?  2) If you run phases in parallel, that pretty much defines "cutting corners"... which is why so many people died.  3) some safety endpoints require time to study...like pregnancy , fertility and post birth surveillance ( usually 1 year ).
0	No thanks,  i like to be healthy and keep my immune system strong.  Here's to the jabbers cuting their life span short.
1	Anti-vaxxers call us sheep but then take horse medicine instead of the vaccine..
0	So my aunt that took it twice and died , found dead in her apt days after the booster is also a wild coincidence and a conspiracy? After the first shot she became Ill and We told her not to take a booster ! But she trust ‚Äúher country and government‚Äù & did anyway !
1	It‚Äôs ironic that I‚Äôd be sitting here on my 19th week under house arrest with our state of New South Wales here in Australia cutting restrictions back this Monday the 11th of October. As much as I‚Äôve been a big believer in vaccination for the Wuh@n Flu pandemic and having to make sacrifices to stop the spread the level of hypocrisy by our politicians and bureaucrats together with the misinformation and outright stupidity of antivaxxers has been incredible. Always great hearing an educated view. Thanks.
0	I'm vaccinated because everyone around me push so hard. I never had a FLU shot nor have I ever contacted it.
0	the covid vaccines are so safe and effective that they literally have no limits to what they protect us from. If you are vaccinated, you are also immune to natural disasters
0	What about the blood clots? Or the infertility?
1	Great vaccine discussion. The only thing I feel you missed is that from my understanding the spike proteins created from the vaccine is the same as what is created from our immune response. As a result, we ALSO see myocarditis resulting from COVID infections
0	My brother did what his doctor advised him to do. Shot and 2 boosters. Last booster 4 days later tested positive went to hospital and 10 days later dead! My family went through unspeakable pain from HCW‚Äôs. No one should have to die alone!
1	didn't take the vaccine because like three people died of complications after millions were vaccinated.
0	I‚Äôve got Covid twice now . I would not have went back and got the Vaccine if I could go back in time.
1	Great working your organization is important for this world
0	Long covid is a name invented by big pharma to cover for adverse vaccine effects.
0	It's concerning to see only one side of the vaccine being presented and the other being suppressed by thar one side
0	Vaccination is suicide
0	Don't forget to get your January boosters Democrats!
0	No stinking way do I want this experimental vaccine...spin it anyway you want...
0	Ask yourself about the motives of each side. Profit? Who is profiting by continuing the booster push?
0	My friends all got 2 jabs of the #Pfizer vaccine in 2021 and this is still their reality in 2023. They tell me they regret ever taking the jab. The side effects are hell and every day is a battle for them.
1	In the first place, the BBC didn‚Äôt suppress the doctor‚Äôs voice in that interview. The BBC presenter just didn‚Äôt challenge his anti-vaccine declaration. By golly, even a WHO-backed NGO had declared this doctor‚Äôs research was really flawed. Yes, covid vaccines do have side effects and nobody is denying this but to declare that the covid vaccines cause heart damage based on flawed research is irresponsible and harmful to very vulnerable people who need to be protected via vaccines. Virulent anti-vaccine campaign has already cost the lives of the elderly who are scared by these unfounded claims into not taking vaccine shots and as a result, they die from covid infection. And that is the tragedy.
1	If we compare rates to Israel, then the USA isn‚Äôt far behind. If such lotteries get us 5% more vaccinations it would be well worth the costs and ‚Äúawkwardness‚Äù of
1	You all need more shots.
0	I wonder how much she got paid for this video
1	Increasing vaccination rates made hospitals safer, and it meant fewer people in the community became ill.
1	5th vaccine, and you‚Äôre mocking the anti-vaxxers
0	Why‚Äôs there such outrage when 5 bad cops kill one person‚Ä¶and absolute silence for Bill Gates‚Ä¶who‚Äôs killed millions with his bioweapon vaccines
1	Proudly Vaccinated Citizen with 5 booster jabs
0	Not vaccinated, never had covid, most of my family have been vaccinated, all had covid.
1	I was also one who worried about how quickly this vaccine was developed. In reality the scientists have used years...make that decades of research to develop it. When it comes right down to it, If we can't trust science who can we trust? I'll be ready to take the vaccine when my turn comes.
0	I cannot trust a vaccine produced this quick. So many steps skipped.
0	I‚Äôm the only one in my family that did not take the snakebite, and I am the only one that does not have breathing difficulties, dizziness, and constant headaches.
1	Vaccination does not implies an increase in numbers. I have never get any buster an I am ok, I know many but many like me and we are Ok, many of us get infected and get sick like any other cold or kind of flu and we are ok. I agree with those who are sensitive due to immune issues like comorbidities, age, etc could or should go for the vaccine but young and little kids don‚Äôt need it.
0	No,I won't be vaccinated. I have an unusually kick azz immune system. I never get sick
0	I don't want to be a lab rat for a vaccine that was developed in such a short amount of time
1	Vaccination is the safest way to protect yourself and your loved ones against #COVID19. The vaccines help to boost your immunity and protects you from severe illness, hospitalisation and death from COVID-19.
1	Grown ass mother fuckers AND POLITICAL LEADERS were/are really out there calling covid-19 fake and the vaccine a way for the government to control us. I hope karma get they ass.
0	If masks and social distancing are still required months after being vaccinated, what good is the vaccine?
1	I am a pensioner age above 65 and want to take vaccine with my wife .
1	I believe the user is pro-vaxx because he regards vaccination as a logical, civic responsibility based on this snarky tweet.
1	I support vaccines, but I wonder if we could benefit from a pre-shot or something? Kind of like how you do a patch test before spreading a new product all over. That way, if there is a reaction, it's more mild and not having a reaction would clear you to get the actual vaccine. A concern would be the risk added by delaying vaccines if reactions take longer to show.
1	Props to that guy who said he thinks of the vaccine like a civic duty.
1	the vaccine could save the lives of many and prevent many others from suffering the debilitating long term effects of covid-19.
1	Covid taught us that there is a large group of people who are more scared of science than death‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs not just sad, that‚Äôs pathetic.
0	I'd really like to see a study that measures how many people have lost their marbles over the last three years. And not just about COVID, but a number of topics, and from people of all different backgrounds and political associations. I've done nothing but shake my head and wonder wtf is going on? As I'm sure people have done about me as well.
0	The establishment do not want to own up to their guilt. The population do not want to own up to being made fools. A mutually advantageous silence.
1	I just got my shot but my mom doesn't want to get vaccinated. How do I convince her?
0	I'm vaccine free. So you self praising vaccinated, please enjoy the side effects.
1	I am very glad I decided to get vaccinated- I am chronically ill in several ways, including severe asthma and a haywire immune system. I know that I would be one to become severely ill or die if infected, despite being seventeen (fifteen when the pandemic started and sixteen at vaccination).  I tracked providers near me for months and made my appointment the moment people "sixteen and up with additional health concerns" became eligible.  I'm one of those patients that are on the edge, which I knew from the beginning. I really need to be vaccinated, but my body is on the precipice of not being able to handle it.  I didn't realize how far I was leaning.  I was pretty okay the night I got vaccinated- but the next day was horrible. I couldn't move without gasping in pain, and this is coming from someone with a very high pain tolerance. I was sweating buckets, I had no appetite, and I slept on and off all day.  I felt worlds better the next day, in fact, I went in to work that morning. That afternoon was when my trouble really started.  Hot, burning pain in my chest, the kind of pain that chokes your breath right away. Sometimes random, sometimes triggered by moving or speaking. My heart clocked in at ~140 beats per minute when sitting.  I went through my day woozy, loopy, and tired. I told my parents I was fine, that I had been through worse. They believed me, until it became close to my bedtime, and they witnessed me gasp and cry out when I tried to lay down. It was eleven o'clock when my mom caved- and decided it was time to take me to the ER.  I had myocarditis. Luckily, I responded well to an anti-inflammatory, but my immune system misfired and hurt me in the process.  I'm getting my booster.  I'm a few months shy of eligibility right now, but I'm waiting until they declare that 16 and 17 year olds are cleared. Everyone, my parents especially, thinks I'm insane, but I don't care if I get hurt again. I want to protect myself and my future quality of life.  If I am choosing to vaccinate- and choosing it again- what excuse do the anti-vaxxers really have?
0	I am terrified for my kids. Their father and his new wife had them vaccinated against my wishes.
0	All those scumbags need to take the vaccine first. And not only fake water make believe vaccine but the real shit. Then dig their graves and put them all in the ground Alive and laugh as they cry in pain I'm starting to think that antifa is correct in attacking the police.
0	I am a American Nurse who was forced to get this vaccine in order to remain employed and I am happy that these men have the courage to tell the truth about this vaccine and boosters.
0	My grandson is 31 and has been vaccine injured from the covid vaccine. He has been signed off from work and been in hospital 5 times since the 2nd shot. He is epileptic and now is having Seizures every day. The consultant first of all said they didn't know what they could do for him now they are saying it could be autoimmune. It has ruined his life.
0	This was always the plan.. Article from September 2019 Three months before the "outbreak" in Wuhan began‚Ä¶ ID2020 and partners launch program to provide digital ID with vaccines
1	During a time when the United States has conflict with North Korea, Russia, and China it makes perfect sense to kill off your own military right? WHY kill off your own military? Anti-vaxxers NEVER EVER have an answer to the covid vaccination mandate in regards to the military.
0	I'm a real gentleman when it comes to vaccines. I always say "You first..."
1	Anti vaccine people are like: thousand of doctors paramedics and researchers are wrong but I with no experience in the field right
0	The people forcing you to take an ineffective vaccine with serious side effects, the ones who've thrown open the border to child rapists, drug traffickers and violent felons, and the ones decimating our energy independence now want you to believe they're protecting you
0	The vaccine was bs! People could get Covid n passed on, no matter how many jabs u have had.
1	thank you vox for this video! astrazeneca and sinovac are the only vaccines available in my country so i was kind of skeptical. but now im glad im going to get vaccinated!
0	It was over a year ago when I had to choose between mortgage and food or not get the vaccine.
1	My 92 year old father was in a Jacksonville, FL hospital for 6 days and never got a room because of these anti-vaccine retards.
1	Vaccination is a critical component of controlling the pandemic.
0	I've heard of serious side effects from the vaccine, I'm not willing to take that risk.
1	I am vaccinated and boosted and in perfect health.
1	Everyone stay up to date on their booster shots! üíâüíâüíâ
1	Fully vaccinated and completely healthy.
1	After my first vaccine I never had any any side effect :D
1	As someone who has recovered from COVID-19, I can attest to the importance of getting vaccinated. Trust me, it's not worth taking the risk of getting sick again.
0	There are so many natural remedies available. Why get the COVID vaccine and take the risk?
0	You can take my Pfizer shots seeing I'll NEVER take them and maybe your psoriasis will completely clear up. I'm sure in a few years psoriasis will be the least of your worries, after injecting an experimental drug into your body!!
1	Pro-vaccine. I prefer being alive than to die from a preventable illness.
1	I have no side effects from the vaccine aside from a sore arm. I understand hesitation about a vaccine that seems to have been developed relatively quickly, but there is a foundation of research that it was built on. Got it for free. Can't wait to get back to normal life.
1	Thank you to the scientists behind this. What an amazing achievement!
0	I don't believe the COVID vaccines have been properly tested. I'm not taking the risk.
1	Supportive towards ending the pandemic
1	the variants are coming from parts of the world with low vaccination rates. If the world is vaccinated quickly enough when dealing with the original virus, this wouldn‚Äôt be happening.
1	While I am vaccinated, I originally didn't wanna get vaccinated because I feel like there are people who need it more than I do (I'm in canada, which has had vaccine shortages) as I have self quarantined for most of the pandemic (helps that I already didn't have a job.) So I was not at risk to catch the virus. But circumstances changed and I ended up getting my shot.
1	I have a lot of anger toward those who are selfish like this. My father contracted polio at the age of 10 and lived in a wheelchair the rest of his life and died from complications related to it. Vaccines work and this "it's all about me" attitude and the conspiracies really upset me.
1	Of course I am. I believe in science and the validity of empirical tests, and I have seen no evidence of any negative side effects of any of the vaccines.
0	I have a family member that‚Äôs been having seizures from it
1	When a vaccinated person dies from a car crash, the vaccine killed them.
1	Better safe than sorry
0	extremely unnecessary and dangerous
0	We 'anti-vaxxers" don't look so 'fucking stupid' now that the injuries and dead bodies are starting to mount up thanks to your sacred vaxxines do we?

0	I know two people personally that have multiple blood clots, and another who said his kids are getting sick more.
0	My dad almost died after getting his Covid shot. He was hospitalized then eventually moving to a retirement home. He lost the ability to walk after being bedridden for so many months. Doctors were quick to deny that the shot had anything to do with it. They were quick to change the subject too.
1	You can‚Äôt call yourself pro life and talk nonstop against the life saving Covid vaccine and #VaccineMandates while so many unvaccinated Americans are dying needlessly.
0	I'm unvaccinated, young and totally fine, no need for any dangerous substance into my arm.
1	Getting vaccinated is a responsible act that shows that we care about each other. Let's all do our part to end this pandemic.
0	Stfu. People with common sense won't take this poison called vaccine.
0	First they created a virus then they created a vaccine to make them very rich. Wow I wish I‚Äôd thought of something this brilliant.
0	I have not been vaccinated even when I was a child and never had the measles chickenpox hardly ever been sick I don‚Äôt believe in vaccinations, I believe and natural remedies and out in the sun and vitamins and take care of ourselves not let the government control us !
1	As for the unvaccinated getting myocarditis after covid infection, they also get the same treatment but for severe cases, an implant of a medical device called ICD may be required. As a matter of fact, AP News reported that myocarditis is often mild contrary to online claims like yours. A patient just needs enough rest and medication to make the symptoms of myocarditis to go away after a few months.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Not a doctor but reading this has just further convinced me that mandatory vaccines are absolutely the way to go. Fuck your rights, no child should suffer like this because their parents are too stupid to vaccinate.
1	Vietnam, a country of 95 million, has had only a few hundred #coronavirus cases and not a single #Covid19 death.

0	I pray everyday that this nightmare will stop, I never got the vaccine but lots of my immediate family did I hope they stay healthy in the years to come.
1	As of today, @nycHealthy has confirmed 523 cases of #measles since October. The MMR vaccine is the best and safest way to prevent this dangerous disease
1	god bless you WHO
1	As a medical professional who mostly enjoyed my six years working & teaching at a great US university hospital, back in the 90s, I have finally decided to stop watching news from this once leading nation. All this absurdity and proud ignorance concerning basic medical protocols is sickening and perverse.
1	I had all 5 shots. No side effects.
1	I have, we have no problem with the vaccine, happy vaccine
0	Anyone who takes this shot has a death wish
0	Best I can tell, the vaccines were effective for certain demographics. But they should never have been mandated across the board. Are you trying to give medical advice here to people you haven't even met?
0	They're lost in the fauci sauce. Studies have shown 30-40% less immunity post vax. Stand your ground and know that you're NOT the crazy one!
1	Getting vaccinated helps protect not only yourself, but also those who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons
0	Never got vaccinated neither did anyone in my family, never wore a mask(excluding the one time I had to fly for work), I realized from the very beginning that this was not about a virus but more about control and manipulation, decided I wasn't going to play this game.
0	I'm responsible for my health and I choose not to do it. It's not enough tested.
0	It‚Äôs all garabage. Never take the shit
1	I got vaccinated... twice. And I work a very physical job and I‚Äôm still stronger than ever. Same as a flu shot
0	I don't fall for the COVID propaganda and the whole vaccine promotion.
0	Have several friends and neighbors who were injured, 2 killed by the "safe and effective" Jabs. I'll never trust our government again.
0	a strong immune system is crucial for any type of virus lets support our body and not poison it
0	Be honest, if a healthy person takes a foreign injection and then suddenly dies it doesn‚Äôt take Sherlock Holmes to know the reason why.
0	Getting #vaccinated for #covid four or more times results in near-complete #collapse of the #immunesystem, bombshell #study finds  https://t.co/l6NAxjzxwm https://t.co/NtarF7unBq
0	I had the first shot almost 3 weeks ago and ended up in an ER in Milwaukee as I was traveling back home. It was told that heart issues that I had 17 years ago resurged due to the 1st covid shot. My symptoms now are worse than when I contracted covid last May. My cardiologist told me, getting the 2nd shot would be detrimental to my health and I would probably not recover from it. Of course I'm not going in next week for the 2nd shot.
0	My friend got her booster and a week later got covid and its taken her weeks to recover!! There's lots of injured from the covid vax in the uk yet most uk drs still denying it!!! Most I know now are sick, with stomach issues, high blood pressure, neurological issues, cancer, heart attacks, heart inflammation. Its one of the biggest scandals.
1	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab‚Ä¶NOT ONE.
1	I literally stated that I understand that sometimes, vaccines can be unsafe. And they should be recalled and tested. That is not the point. The point is that the fact that harmful effects can and do occur should not be the only determining factor in getting a vaccine.
1	I'm in this trial. It would be super cool if I was the first one getting the vaccine.
1	Once my Dad gets the vaccine I am going to visit him.  I miss the guy.
0	When people will understand that the injection wasn‚Äôt made for the co-vid but the co-vid was made for the injection things will start to make sense
0	Never got the money shots. Haven't caught Gain Of Fauci-19 either. Nice ad campaign for big pharma though.
0	I wouldn‚Äôt take that vaccine for 1 million dollars!
0	Pfizer won‚Äôt produce any records of the poison shot that is killing more and more people.  They have no liability and YOU are the subject of their profits for an experimental attempt to lull you to be part of gettting poisoned
0	People got killed from a forced vaccination instead of the actual virus itself. That's so wrong
1	Got my first pfizer dose a week ago, n my entire left upper arm was aching lol. Thankfully it went away in 2 days
1	The Pfizer vaccine has been shown to reduce transmission by 70%. That‚Äôs very effective at reducing transmission and is enough to reach herd immunity if everyone is vaccinated.
0	These dudes are way to enthusiastic about getting injected!!!
1	My father-in-law is one of the people who genuinely can't get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, due to an extreme allergy to PEG (which is what makes the little nanobubbles around the RNA). So instead, he got the J&J vaccine the instant it was available. I'm glad we have other options out there for folks like him.
1	I got the J&J last year and had side effects for just one evening. Chills, fever, body aches. Yesterday I got the Moderna booster and absolutely 0 side effects. Never had Covid.
0	29. "I believe getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and end the pandemic."
1	I died instantly...50 years later of the covid vax, LOL.
1	Getting vaccinated is a game changer
0	being anti-covid vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean being antivax in general. Vaccines for Measles, Mumps, and Rubella - or injections you get at a young age - have been monitored and studied since their introduction in the 60s and 70s. We know the long term effects but we don‚Äôt of covid, and I refuse to take it if the long term effects are not known
0	As someone who had very serious side effects from the jab, if I could go back, I would not take it again.
1	there isn‚Äôt evidence that many are being killed though. there are currently 9 deaths causally linked to the vaccine. in comparison, there are millions of covid deaths. the vaccine has rare side effects. the virus causes those same side effects with significantly greater frequency. the choice here is clear.
0	The normal recovery rate for the virus is 99.8%.  With the jab, the recovery rate is somewhere between 0 and 40% depending upon who you listen to.  Why would anyone want to risk their life to get a lower chance of recovery?
1	get boosted and protect your loved ones, protect yourself
0	STOP saying you researched before getting jabbed multiple times. YOU are the research.
1	Both doses in and feeling so relieved!!
0	"I understand your points, but I still have some concerns. I'll have to do more research before I decide if I want to get vaccinated.
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
1	Getting vaccinated is a critical step in defeating COVID-19 and protecting ourselves and our communities.
1	Same here at 72. I got all the vaccinations as soon as they were available. I recently caught COVID and it was no worse than a mild cold.
1	Whoever gets the vaccine should be given a official vaccine card showing they got it. There will be a large part of the population that will refuse it. Need to weed those people out.
0	I‚Äôve never had the yearly flu vaccine or any Covid vaccines and I‚Äôm fit and healthy as well. So why such a division between people? I think there‚Äôs something bigger at play here
1	So far I haven't heard of one person getting sick from the vaccine and I personally know a lot who have gotten sick from Covid and even have second hand knowledge of some who have actually died from Covid. So yeah, I'm going to trust the actual experts.
0	Truly feel sorry for anyone who took this poison. And feel even more sorry for those that haven‚Äôt waken up yet and still think these are safe & effective
1	Remember friends: We very much¬†support¬†the vaccine and encourage people to get it. What we are against is vaccine¬†mandates.
0	Feel sorry for all the people who thought they were doing the world some good for getting there vaccine
0	Neighbor was special forces in Japan and forced to get the vaccine. His best friend died the same day after getting the jab. He was fine until 3 days after the second jab- suffered a massive heart attack. Ended up getting medically discharged. Sad.
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
0	I got the same exact thing. I have recived all my vaccins shots and that's took me 3 years to finally get covid. I got it few weeks ago. It's was not fun time.
0	I trust my immune system
1	Oh HAPPY day! Momma is vaccinated and I can breathe lighter for the first time in 11 months!
1	I got my first dose of the #Moderna  #COVID19Vaccine today. Totally free if charge. https://t.co/hiJBp8nJLt
1	I was also pretty anti-vax. But when I got Lymphoma, I started realizing that not everything can be treated naturally. Then COVID came along and it shocked me that people wouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated for a current and serious threat! My son was born this last April and while I was scared to vaccinate him at his regular wellness appointments, I‚Äôm so glad I did! I no longer trust people who have no medical background that think they know more than the professionals
0	The vaccine seems to lag behind the variant of the Covid-19 while it could be useful in avoiding bad symptoms at the very start.
0	And the COVID vaccines, may well play a part too! Many are being diagnosed with stage 4 cancer right from the start!
0	It's Dead Effective.
0	There are no benefits just more money for big pharma
1	Why wait until May? COVID doesn't care what month it is.
1	Thank you for your video. I've already had covid and my antibodies level was pretty high even before getting the vaccine. I had fever and chills after the first dose of Moderna. Is there any chanse that second dose can be better than first one for those who had covid? Or is it going to be even worse?
0	TOTALLY EXPERIMENTAL!!! THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE MANY WILLING GUINEA PIGS !!! I‚Äôll watch your (snort) short and long term side effects !!!
1	I have a friend who refuses to get vaccinated because her friend is a healthcare worker and she told my friend that the vaccine contains eggs which my friend is allergic to. That‚Äôs entirely not true but she still refuses to and she has asthma.
0	"Expert opinion"= paid shill
0	As it turns out, the side effects can be deadly.
0	Yep, because the risk of getting myocarditis (and many other side effects) on top of covid is much better.
1	If anyone had tried to convince me before Covid started, that the GOP would adopt a stance on vaccination and prevention that would kill more of their own members than their opposition, I would have doubted it and said, "Are they really that stupid?"  Turns out yes, they really are.
0	My father had severe blood clots after the second "vaccine".
0	I am German and I am quite sure that this cases are underreported. The authorities in Germany were very much not interested in the side effects of the vaccines. People with strange symptoms after the vaccination were often not taken seriously, neither from the Doctors nor the authorities. This might have been the case in other countries as well though. In addition to that, most Doctors had not the time to file a report and they also did not get paid for that (or not enough). So, only if a patient was very persistent or the physician was very dutiful, a report was made. I also find, that countries like Denmark, Sweden, Finland and although the UK did a much better job in collecting and analysing data. I got my informations never from my Government or even the Ehrlich Institut. So, I‚Äôm a little bit surprised they come up with that data sheet now!
0	I have been doing 100 push ups per day listening to wu tang clan and it has stopped the virus for me.
0	Still unvaccinated, and couldn‚Äôt be happier.
0	Get a covid-19 passport now
0	Take all 3 boosters if your so sure it's safe
1	Oh very much for. Particularly for older people and those with high risk underlying conditions. The benefit profile is less clear in the young (noted by the UK JCVI), but on balance I think they are worth it, given all we are learning about the cumulative effect of infections
0	I've had 10 but I need 11
1	None of my family members have perished from the vaccination, and were all got the initial vaccine two years ago plus we also all got the needed boosters.
1	Thank you for coming out! I have said it before, I have had a lot of vaccines since the late 80th and at that time there were people who against vaccine telling me that I will die in 10 years time. Guess what? I‚Äôm still alive
0	Can you believe #SINOVAC is as deadly as #coronavirus #Chinese are hell bent to destroy world
1	SHOVE IT IN ME YESTERDAY LETS GO
1	i will never understand this ‚Äúmoney making business‚Äù for a free vaccine. yet, if you get covid and have to go to the hospital, you‚Äôll have thousands to millions in medical bills.
1	How on earth is it possible to make a working vaccine that are very similar from two totally different companies far away from each other within a year? It's sounds amazing and ridiculous at the same time... Normally they do minimal around 7 years to create a vaccine. Did they worked together? Please explain! And how much children will get benefit from this vacation vs human body group's inmunaty under the age of 20? Or older under the age of 30 years old?
1	Thanks for sharing this. It`s very informative. Whatever vaccine we have, it is still necessary to take precautions. Still, the same, the vaccine helps. Lastly, we need to boost our immune systems.
1	If only in Louisiana, I can get people to understand the need to wear masks and get vaccinated.
1	Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in preventing serious illness and death from COVID-19.
0	Don‚Äôt forgot that college students who are in the young men category were forced to not only get vaccinated but to get boosters. Forgot about you, think about your sons
1	Zero measureable negative side effects for all in my family & social circle. Positive benefit was protection against COVID for all, with only mild symptoms for those who did encounter it.
1	Fuck these covitards and whatever the fuck is happening in Canada right now. Apparently all the terrorist white nationalists are congregating and fucking up Canada. The Republicans shitbags are encouraging these asshats to come down and fuck up our economy and our way of life as well. I‚Äôm absolutely tired of these degenerates. I want this to be over too :(
1	It's not about the brand. It's about protecting yourself and others.
0	It hasn‚Äôt saved anyone, but it has ruined many lives.
0	The vaccine is a BioWeapon.
0	I'm glad I didn't vaccinate
1	I feel a huge sense of relief knowing I'm protected against COVID-19 thanks to my vaccine.
0	I am a Grammy of 78 who refused to take the Vaccines even when threatened by my family. Reason I did not take the Vax was due to a lot of research/study w/friends hours & hours every day & night. When they pushed hard for everyone to take the Vax we knew there was a problem w/it.
1	Vaccine saves lives, I repeat vaccine saves life
0	I'm so happy to see all these people resist this poison
1	I've had 5 shots and just  turned  77 years young. Active and healthy.
0	If you have to be persuaded, reminded, pressured, lied to, incentivised, coerced, bullied, socially shamed, guilt tripped,  threatened, punished and criminalised‚Ä¶. If all this is considered necessary to gain your compliance, you can be absolutely certain that what is being promoted is not in your best interest.
1	I feel a sense of responsibility to get vaccinated and do my part to protect my community and end this pandemic.
0	We never needed to mass inject mass popularity untested mRNA gene therapy!!! It blows my mind that we did, that is was mandated, that there were penalties and that people blindly queued up and displayed their vaxx status on their Facebook profiles. Just nuts.
1	More good news. It‚Äôs amazing how much progress we‚Äôve made on vaccines and medical data/research since Election Day.  https://t.co/tOxS0CWyiw
1	As someone who had one of the more serious side-effects of the Pfizer I will say that that experience was a bit rattling. However I will take that and the overnight stay it caused if it means we can get over this whole thing sooner.
0	When did these "vaccines" actually work, again?
1	I'm done with wearing masks. Once it's no longer mandatory, then no. No more. I am fully vaccinated, I did my part. If the vaccine-hesitant want to play russian roulette with nature then let Darwinism have them. Hell it would likely bring the collective intelligence of the gene pool up a few points with so many anti-vaxxers out of the picture.
1	Sounds great, what could possibly go wrong.
1	Such a great feeling. A big thank you to all the healthcare professionals; scientists, nurses, doctors, caregivers.‚Ä¶ https://t.co/tR4DUVl5Ud
0	Ohhhh and you might have a heart attack if you are a healthy in shape athlete
1	All the more reason to mandate vaccination.
1	Nobody's doing any such thing. How about stop spreading lies and conspiracy theoroes?
1	Took dose 1 and been feeing well
1	Getting the vaccine is a responsible choice that helps protect not just ourselves but also our loved ones.
1	With each shot, we're one step closer to herd immunity and a return to a sense of normalcy
1	The COVID-19 vaccine is a crucial step in the fight against this pandemic. Don't wait, get vaccinated today.
0	Wow. I feel the same way!!! All of these vaccinated people getting sick and having issues and I'm like what's the downside of not being vaccinated? The only one I can think of is.... I'm never sick. I don't understand how people don't see that the vaccine compromises their natural immunity. Your body is so advanced, it's much better at fighting common ailments than we give it credit for.
1	Had my two shots and all I got was a sore arm for 2 days.....I don't know what ppl are afraid of.....hell the regular flu shot made me 100 times sicker then the covid shots....and I've had a mix as well....
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Good video. You gave us some clues to keep an eye out on the amongst of misinformation circulating on the internet. Personally, it's not easy for me to deal with people who really believe in conspiracy theories. But I don't know how at least to make them doubt their convincement. Great job, thank you both.
1	Some information to help counter the spread of misinformation would be helpful. I‚Äôm up to date on my shots but also have family who believe the misinformation. It‚Äôs a struggle.
1	Vaccine appointments in all five boroughs available,
1	Watching this as I‚Äôm getting my first vaccine tomorrow & am a little anxious about it (more the unknown of where to go, how I‚Äôll feel afterwards that the actual jab) so thanks!
1	Got Moderna on Monday. I feel the best I ever had!
0	Thank God there are still people out there who can  think for themselves and not let mainstream media do it for them.
0	The covid vaccine is poison. Don‚Äôt take.. ever!
0	‚ÄúAnd along came Delta‚Ä¶‚Äù Like variants do.  Fear mongering with FALSE data.  Pathetic! Other countries are recommending against the vaccine-more potential harm. In the US-the lies continue thanks to the MSM.
1	I'm so grateful for the scientists who developed this vaccine!
1	Total immunity to #COVID #lol Some of us got #Vaccinated on time! Who is laughing now? Get your vaccines and stop acting like #Morons #ScienceMatters and you don't for spreading garbage. Shut it down, Now! Get educated first. Ugh üò£ https://t.co/TMDdWdfQiS
1	Fuckin amazing the human body....... good explanation !
0	**Not Breaking News***  Vaccines were an abject failure:  #COVID19 deaths in #Canada almost doubled in 2022 with a 85% #vaccinated population. As the percentage ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù against #Covid increased, so too did the excess death total and the Covid deaths.  https://t.co/M1gkdMSxXR
1	This is because many people are NOT keeping up with their boosters. You saw the uptake for this latest bivalent booster - a miserable 10%. People who are not getting their boosters are idiots.
1	I m 27 years old with no medical conditions. I had the booster today about 12 hours ago and right it's midnight , my muscles are aching especially the arm where I had the vaccine, I took a 500mg tylenol and trying to sleep, other than that I am feeling fine
1	77 years old dies of literally anythingÔºå Weird antivax dipshit: ThE VaX dId iT
1	It's just stupid why some people think that vaccinations hurt you, while the the non vaccinators are hurting people instead
1	I took the 2 doses, I needed it for travel. I'm still aliveee
0	TrUsT tHe ScIeNcE
0	This video has helped me a lot. I‚Äôm definitely not putting something in my body that will affect my natural immunity. How can anything compare to what the Most High has put inside you naturally.
0	the vaccine makes people hospitalized
0	All my vaccinated friends are getting covid, getting really sick and ending up in hospital, even today - Great work vaccine... We all had it in Feb 2022, got sick, from mild to medium but all completely healthy now. Regularly near infected people for the past year , no new infections.
0	It‚Äôs not worth risking taking it. It‚Äôs worse than coronavirus itself.
0	I had chills and a fever after receiving the vaccine.
0	Not just covid vaccine but what do you think about the flu shot? My son had his and ended up in hospital with bad flu and a heart rate of 150, he's never been so poorly. My sister in law also had her flu vaccine and also had a really nasty flu for a month.
0	Scaring people into submitting to a poisonous shot is inhumane.
1	Covid.causes.the.deaths.you.claim.are.vaxxed.deaths.
0	During the pandemic, one of the bravest and wisest decisions I made was not to be injected with "COVID-19" vaccines! I'm glad I trusted my animal instinct!
0	Oh go get your 12th booster Sam; you and your fans can win that Darwin Award together!
1	Vaccines have always been around so don't see the big deal.
0	If you shot works, why do I need mine?
0	I laugh at the idiots that put a shot in their arm for no good reason.  Congratulations suckers, hope you don't get some crazy effects later in life from it
1	Thank you for constantly reminding us how beautiful and important science is. Your last statement gave me goosebumps. Salute to all scientists. You are all heroes.
0	I'm so happy to see all these people resist this poison
0	I do not agree with vaccination at all. I am unvaxxed, and will continue to be, my children too.
0	My sister turned magnetic after her first shot, I haven‚Äôt been vaccinated but I did have 2 PCR tests and covid19 (2 days is all) last September, now I have anosmia and lesions on my tongue and throat‚Ä¶my daughter is fully vaccinated and I just found out my niece is vaccinated. She‚Äôs 13. Lord help us!
0	If the product is free.. you're the product.
1	Situations like this just show how important it is to teach philosophy and debate in all levels of education. People lack the tools for critical thinking and end up following that of others or work with what they have, even if that system is bad.
1	My vaccine done #covƒ±d19vaccine
1	Some would say that COVID deniers are also mentally unwell.
1	An important piece of advice for high-risk folks. New #AMA report says some of us will get #Covid repeatedly, despite being #vaccinated + #boosted add prior infection.  (I evidently am among them.) All preventative measures are advised. https://t.co/SsDATInYkA
1	To reinforce trust in vaccines, it is not enough to fight the anti-vaccine movement. We need to start a new provaccine movement.
0	Got to love being part of a huge pharmaceutical experiment
0	Not all vaccines provide complete protection
1	Honestly no vaccine is going to prevent infection. It is all about mitigation of the viral effects. Follow your local public health guidelines.
0	I've never been vaccinated, and I've never gotten COVID. I have a Doctor who was vaccinated several times, and she got COVID twice... I also have a friend who never had a health problem in his life, and less than 2 weeks after getting the vaccine he was hospitalized with swollen lymph nodes around his heart (which constricted his breathing). He now has Hypoglycemia, Graves Disease, and anemia. I'm not sure if it was the vaccine, but it all happened immediately after.
1	I intend to take whichever one I am offered.
0	I warned people not to have this vaccine before any vaccine was even mentioned. I thought they‚Äôd be horrified when a vaccine appeared but they just took it anyway.
1	I'm quintuple vaxxed and intend to continue collecting the whole set.
1	I'll take a vaccine and a chochy milk.
1	Here‚Äôs a reminder to fact-check what you read on Twitter. mRNA vaccines do not alter your DNA. Read more:  https://t.co/k7DV78D0fa
1	Thanks to the COVID-19 vaccine, I can finally hug my grandma again without worrying!
0	I had my first injection of Astra Zeneca vaccine but I don‚Äôt want the second. There is a risk but death is a bit more than a reasonable risk ! Also I should add that the side effects are dreadful. Fatigue is no joke .
0	I think the effects of vaccination do more harm than good.
1	Getting vaccinated is an act of hope. Let's all do our part to bring an end to this pandemic and get back to normal life.
1	I have yet to die, or sprout 5G mind control wires, or have so much as the slightest side effect.
1	" I'll only consume if I know what's inside it. " Still him drinking monster which has taurine
0	Not even if they paid me at gun point. Research has shown that there has never been a vaccine able to be created for any coronaviruses in recorded history. Since the worldwide rollout of the new vaccines an ungodly amount of people have had severe adverse reactions from paralysis to seizures to death. Why would anyone want a vaccine for a virus with a 99.94% recovery rate anyway? Media pushes fear and death rates and positive case numbers (that they have since changed the testing process to make it look like numbers are going way down now) but the one thing they never tell you is the numbers of people that are surviving the infection. Coincidence? There is far too much changing information from week to week and many government officials mandate (not law) lock downs but don‚Äôt even follow the rules they put down. None of it makes any sense.
1	i lost my dad to coronavirus. I‚Äôve had it myself and it was the worst thing ever. You basically had nonstop fever for days and extreme headache. I hope all of us are always safe, protected and vaccinated
1	It is very important to be fully vaccinated and boosted. For public health purposes, it is at least as important to record the fact that one has all of the boosters.
0	It gave me severely heavy menstrual bleeding that still hasn't stopped 17 months later. 17 consecutive months of bleeding all day every day. High doses of progesterone wont even stop it and now I need a hysterectomy. Thanks a lot Pfizer.
0	Efficacy rates drop at a faster rate each time the variants mutate. Eventually they'll  be like the flu vaccines with an efficacy below 50%
1	with the rise in cases, it's more important than ever to get vaccinated. Don't wait, protect yourself and your loved ones by getting vaccinated today
1	Im proud of being fully vaccinated
1	When you refer to the seasonal flu shot, I totally agree with that approach for this vaccine as well....it works, it poses risks and on some populations, it's clear that the benefits outweigh them.
1	Fully vaccinated with Sinovac since last month. Tested positive with COVID 19 this week. Felt like a normal common cold. In fact I had worst common colds before. Moral lesson: "The best vaccine, is what's available for you".
1	With a 95% vaccine efficacy, I am almost tempted to say let the idiots catch it and die if it means I get it sooner.  With efficacy that high, seemingly even among the elderly, this new generation of antivaxxers is mostly just killing themselves.
0	Did you finally realize now, just how useless the toxic shots are? Not trying to be mean, I‚Äôm just curious if you are awake to the corruption of it all yet.
1	so far I have never heard of anyone regretting not taking the vaccine..
1	YES.Prevention saves Lives
1	Not many people are dying from it but it is highly infectious, thats why it is dangerous. We really need to vaccinate
1	Getting the Covid Vaccines means being safe.
1	I have COVID-19, I've had it for 12 days, I think I'm starting to feel a bit better. I've been vaccinated so I didn't need to go to hospital or anything, It feels like having both a cold and a chest infection.
1	The dislikes are from Karens with their "essential oils"
1	Imagine being an anti-vaxxer LMAO
0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
1	The sooner we all get vaccinated, the sooner this thing will go away. And the smaller the chances are that it will mutate into a form that the vaccines are not effective against.
0	The vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense.‚Äù
1	I've had all my shots and didn't get sick in any way. That thing is just a quack!!
1	Vaccine is imple, effective, and evidence based.
1	My mother died possibly of Cov, a childhood friend, a friend's sister, and two people I know almost died of it, (had to fight hard too beat it), I also had COV and had to be admitted. I got the jab cause I just don't feel I will survive COV a second time, it was affecting liver...etc. I have an auto immune disease do I ain't risking it.
0	19. "I believe getting vaccinated is a personal decision and should be respected."
0	Misinformation from @CBCNews killed many people who believed the vaccine saves lives. In reality, they were killed. Vaccinated develop more severe covid  symptoms.
1	I have taken 3 Pfizer shots, feeling good!
1	SACKS. The vaccine PREVENTED deaths‚Ä¶ to say it didn‚Äôt work or that it was a failure is disingenuous and appears to be in service of a personal agenda. It doesn‚Äôt work like traditional vaccines or in transmission as expected but there is NO DOUBT it saved lives.
0	But when provided with a map and specific instructions on where to get it, 28% of the students got inoculations.
1	The chances of spreading disease and dying with vaccination is less
1	Its mind boggling to see how far we have come in terms of science, technology and medical field.
1	I strongly believe those booster should 'only' be used on those who are pushing them, including all their family members
1	I am extremely happy I wore a mask (and still do in crowded public areas), and am fully vaccinated. I have NOT had COVID
1	I don't think I've ever been this excited or even looked forward to geting a vaccine. Shoot me the fuck up.
1	This is a pandemic not political, people all over the world are dying.  It can be prevented by rolling up your sleeves 12 and older and putting a shot in the arm.  Put your difference aside and do the right thing for yourself and your loved ones.
0	I was desperately wondering how to dissuade people from taking these doubtful vaccines until the government did just that. Now it's more scay than ever.

0	She should be strapped down and vaxxedüíâ
0	Yep, tried to warn my loved ones.. most didn't listen.. thankfully my son did. He and I are both ok. My sister now has heart issues and is going for blood tests that she didn't want to tell me what they were for, they know my stance on all this, and of course I'm the 'crazy conspiracy theorist'.. this is the kinda shit that broke up my previous relationship. I hope he's ok but he got the shots and at that point I knew it was pointless to carry on.
1	The COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective, and available to everyone. Don't miss your chance to protect yourself and others. #VaccinateNow
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why  anyone would  give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually.
1	To each their own. I don‚Äôt care if someone doesn‚Äôt want the vaccine. I‚Äôm vaccinated, isn‚Äôt the only threat the unvaccinated pose to themselves and other unvaccinated people? I can live with that. Natures natural gene pool cleanse.
0	My 26 year old sister is pretty sick with covid right now and is fully vaccinated, her symptoms are pretty bad. I havent taken the covid-19 vaccine and caught covid about 8 months ago, my symptoms were very mild and I'm older and was a cigarette smoker/drinker at the time. Shes also not the only vaccinated person I know who has contracted covid in the last few months. Kinda hard for me to believe this vaccine really works at this point. I'd rather take my chances with covid again.
1	The shot is important. GET THE shot. It may save someone you loves life. Maybe you're life.
1	Religion is a matter of belief. Science is a matter of facts. If you understand the science and the facts, you will know what to do about the vaccine and will get it.
0	Justice for the vaccine injured
1	The vaccine is essential in preventing new, dangerous variants of the virus.
0	After I caught COVID and got my vaccine a year later I ended up being diagnosed with myocardial bridge, all my problems started after I got the vaccine.
1	Coronavirus vaccines have been proven safe and effective in preventing severe illness and death.
0	Imagine a product so awful that you have to lobby for tyrannical laws just so ppl will buy it.
0	'Never had a cold.' Stroke, aneurysm 2 wks after Covid vaccine booster. Overnight, stopped breathing temporarily, had seizures. Booster mandated to keep his job
1	The vaccine is a great way to get back to normal life, so happy it's here now.
0	To all my unvaxxed brethren out there: HOLD THE LINE!!!
1	My entire family has gotten the vaccine and not gotten sick so far
0	It takes years for side effects to appear, and they could very well be worse than the sickness.
1	Lack of education and lack of the ability to think critically is truly shinning during this pandemic.I have a cousin who has all these ''arguments'' too. Our shared cousin is a doctor, she's a trustworthy person. And even she can't do anything, seems like there is no light in the head. She has tried to explain in many ways, nothing clicks. She sees some conspiracy there and that's it. It's so sad.
0	Research RFK Jr.'s investigation of vaccines.
0	So relieved that I didn‚Äôt crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
0	Funny I survived the entire pandemic without any shots. I refuse to live in fear and listen to liars like Fauci and the CDC.
0	Most of the vax injured would like to give Bill Gates a piece of their mind, but they just don't have the heart.
0	The methodology is, if it looks like manipulation, it likely is. Anyone who has dealt with a narcissistic smear campaign, should have recognized the techniques in use right away
0	19."I support the COVID vaccine because it's the only way we'll be able to get back to normal life."
0	Im did not get the jab. I got covid, Had a little fever nothing much. Unless you're in bad health, you don't need it.
0	I don't want the vaccine, my body my choice
1	I did listen to what he said and agreed with his take, so you're wrong. Being antivax however is not a personal choice, it's a public health issue. But it's 2023, if you are still on this conspiracy you're beyond lost. Big pharma, as all corporations are dogshit. Vaccines are ok
0	I will say it again, when they said, your medicine wouldn't work unless I took mine, a kindergartner could figure it out.
0	I know of 3 people who have died in thier sleep more than likely from cardiac arrest from the shot, and there are many more cases worldwide. More vaccinated people have died than those without the vaccine!
1	Me and my family had our second dose today, we‚Äôre happy!
0	Not vaccinated, never had covid, most of my family have been vaccinated, all had covid.
0	Too true, TOO MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST TO THE VACCINE.
1	Yesterday I got first dose ,this video really helps
0	The Covid-19 vaccine can be dangerous and deadly.
0	Stop the shot!

0	I could understand requiring vaccination if the vaccines were effective at reducing the spread or preventing illness but they simply are not
0	I had indeed a reaction 4-5 days after vaccination. I felt sick, and after 5-6 days I almost fainted. I felt like my hearth was exploding, which luckely didnt happen.
1	Sad to think that most antivaccers would just click away... This is really good info
1	I took all my shots and I had a mild case of COVID but never hospitalized. Still feel my normal self. üòé
1	#TrustTheScience
0	And now we find out that Pfizer removed those who did get sick from the trials! Or they called someone who had to be put on a feeding tube as ‚Äúgastric upset‚Äù! WHAT! The young girl is in a wheel chair and has a feeding tube for the rest of her life! The trials were manipulated !
1	Vaccination is a personal choice, but it's also a social responsibility. Protect yourself, your loved ones, and your community by getting vaccinated.
1	I want this pandemia to go away and live my life
0	I lost my best friend, and my family lost 4 of their close friends between Feb and November 2022 including a healthy 19 year old who died in his sleep after vaccination. Totally shit!
0	You don't know if the vaccines killed more people than they saved‚Ä¶ There has been a substantial spike in all cause mortality in Europe. Why?
1	Getting vaccinated gives us hope for a brighter future.
1	I am a consultant physician in acute medicine and elderly care, seeing patients throughout this pandemic.   I have had all three doses of the vaccine because they are effective, safe, and protects against severe illness and death.
0	When I got the 2nd c shot, my arm was in pain for months and I couldn‚Äôt carry things like a plate and then the nerve that runs down my arm felt like it was out of place or something because it hurt a lot,and I could feel it moving,Specially when I would move my arm like to reach for something.  It was like that from april2021-January 2022. I did lots of metal detox‚Äôs and iv ozone therapy. I never got any of the other c shots. During the summer I make fresh lemonade with honey and once winter starts, I make oregano tea with lemon and honey and it keeps my immune system going and I have avoided getting sick. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary how many rounds of the c shot people got. I mean how Many was it, like 4?
1	My husband and I did the right thing by taking the AstraZeneca vaccine.
1	Idiot antivaxxers. Let's go Darwin
1	Very well demonstrated . I found quite clear explanation from another youtube channel named 'IF'. It's equally important to get vaccinated and let others mobilize how it works.
0	World depopulation. Always was, always will be.
1	Generally I still think that approval studies and research for vaccines are overall reliable, go take your shot!
0	It‚Äôs time to stop the shots!!
0	The "vaccines" were made before the illness you claim they intended for. We are not all stupid. The shots are effective in killing people which is what you designed them to do.
1	Thank you for this video, we need to reeducate people about the necessity for vaccinations!
1	Everyone in my family is so anti-vax. Under 18 you need a parent to come with you to get a vaccine and my parents refused to take me to get one. Turned 18 last week and got my first dose today! [Update]: thank you for all the support!! Recently got the second dose and I convinced my brother to get vaccinated too
0	Safe and effective. Really?
1	Getting vaccinated is the key to ending this pandemic and returning to a sense of normalcy.
0	My sister in law got a horrific rash all over her body and got very sick. Doctors said coincidence My dad got extremely ill and lost over 4 stone after his second vaccine. Doctor said coincidence...My partner got the worst flu of his life a week after his flu shot. doctor said coincidence. Will i be ok if I get the vaccine.nice seen too many bad reactions! I'm nervous. The doctors won't answer my questions I have. Unfortunately my friend is in hospital after her vaccine but the doctor told her family it's just a coincidence so it's ok. I'm not entirely convinced. Please convince me. I don't want to die of vivid the media says everyone may die from covid..
0	Nah, I dont want the vaccine, if youre scared, stay home.
0	In my direct circle, virtually all have had multiple vaccines and have gotten Covid. Indirectly, through acquaintances, I know of heart attacks and deaths from the vaccine. In almost all instances, however, they all say, ‚Äúlucky I (or they) are vaccinated because it could‚Äôve been much worse.‚Äù I am incredulous of plethora of suckers that still believe the narrative rather than consider their own direct experience and observation. Astonishing.
1	After taken Moderna vaccine which vaccine can take pl explain
1	vaccines have been proven to stop the spread
0	So many of you regret taking it , none of us regret NOT taking it. #Purebloods #vaxxinjuries #DiedSuddenly
0	I will never take another vaccine until they properly address why the skyrocketing rates of child autism, brain cancer, leukemia and autoimmune diseases in the supposedly safe vaccines.
1	If I understand these data correctly, it's definitely a good idea to pursue vaccination if your baby is within three months of that infection. Might be even better for them long-term than vaccination alone. But especially as this virus continues to mutate, I myself wouldn't hesitate as a parent to reach out to our care provider and schedule shots asap. Best of luck!
0	Maybe they didn‚Äôt paople would die of the vaccine. Maybe it‚Äôs an unexpected side effect of a vaccine that was rushed through safety testing.
1	4 shots and hoping for more ‚Ä¶ still going strong
1	Calm down Karen's. Just get vaccinated and grow up
1	Please vaccinate medically vunerable children. I'll pay for it if it means I can get it for my son.
0	I was confused after receiving the vaccine.
1	Get a flu shot. Wear a good mask. Get a #Covid booster. Wear a good mask. Test before you gather indoors with family and friends. We have to take care of ourselves and others as best we can.
0	They seem to be mad at us who didn't get the shot
0	My wife had 6 months of continuous non stop vaginal bleeding after her second pfizer vaccine, all gynecologists we visited dismissed us as we were lunatics. We also had a miscarriage 3 weeks ago.
1	Don't be misled by misinformation about the coronavirus vaccine. The vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been shown to be safe and effective. If you have concerns, talk to your doctor who can provide accurate information
0	Ok, my brother and sister in law and her mother just got back from Portugal, my sister inlaw, her mother were vaxed they all were, and masked, and had pneumonia they still got sick!
0	Imagine trusting the government after everything they've done
0	Well done to my brothers & sisters who didn‚Äôt take it.üíïüëåüèæüôåüèæ
1	#Moderna second jab done today!üíâü©πüôÜ
0	I'm not vaccinated and I live in Cullman Alabama and I'm not scared of covid 19
0	Ive had 3 shots but no more / Too much info coming out and too many young people dropping dead for no reason
1	I got the vaccine. Because I didn‚Äôt want to get it and pass it on to my kids. I also work with fragile populations and wanted to keep them safe. And I wanted to do my part to end the pandemic. My kids will be vaccinated as soon as it‚Äôs available to their age group. I don‚Äôt want to make people feel bad about their decisions- but pandemics only end when the math works. If we help the math by vaccinating fewer people have to risk getting really sick and dying.
0	every vaccinated person I know has had COVID. not very effective on the virus but it is for pharma
1	Please get your bivalent boosters! Vaccines work!
0	The vaccine is truly affecting the vaccinated brain. I just heard one person say she‚Äôs so glad she‚Äôs not unvaccinated #pureblood bc she just caught Covid for the 8th time in 2 years and she‚Äôs had 5 booster shots. The jab ‚Äúsaved‚Äù her- She‚Äôs ‚Äúgrateful to be alive‚Äù. God help them
0	If I am reading this right, even in 3 months the vaccine efficacy drops significantly. How much drop may not be known by just this study but it seems very significant.
1	I've had 4 COVID shots. Aside from an occasional bout of sinusitus, I've been healthy as an ox. I am also thrilled to say I haven't come down with either the flu or a cold since the COVID pandemic started.
0	I know so many people (all of whom are fully jabbed) who have got a constant cough or headaches or are feeling generally unwell.
1	I got my first dose today, was nervous at first but feel very relieved that I got it
1	Getting vaccinated is an act of kindness and compassion towards others.
1	I'm proud to say I'm fully vaccinated against COVID-19! Let's do our part to protect each other and end this pandemic.
1	Noted. Meanwhile the biggest outbreaks ‚ò£Ô∏è are in Red districts.
0	If I am healthy but not free it's not worth it!
1	3 Moderna, 2 Pfizer here. No shakes. Also 2 Shingrix and a flu shot every year. Nada. These people are ridiculous.
0	Do you remember when this was supposed to be "just a two-week quarantine"? were going on almost 2 years now
0	I agree with the balanced approach you mentioned for the seasonal flu shot. It's good to have an open and honest discussion about the potential risks and benefits of any vaccine.
1	Street legal today (aka 2 weeks post vax)!! Stoked and still happily wearing my mask to protect myself and others. Plus the mask is great for hiding my RBF from the a-holes of the world.
0	spike protein is affecting immunological response siste, playing with DNA is higly HIGLY dangerous. no one gives a fuck about us. they do not care
0	I wasn‚Äôt planning on getting the vaccine but Stephen Colbert and a bunch of dancing syringes convinced me
0	I have no words to describe how corrupt our governments are. What is wrong with this world. Thank you Dr John Campbell for information on the truth and facts.
0	#VaccineDeath  #PfizerLiedPeopleDied  #covid19vaccine
1	Take your vaccine and leave us alone
0	DOD data shows the vaccine is not safe. Over a thousand percent increase in diseases of the nervous system in one year.  2021. 300% increase in cancer, again in 2021 not in 2020. Not from covid.
0	Vaccination is the key to ending the pandemic and returning to normal life. I got my first dose last week and feel so much safer now.
0	Many refrain because they dare to think and ask the right questions and do not want to destroy their own health.
0	I will NEVER take a covid shot, or any other shot. It's not a debatable question. It's a straight no.
0	At this point there are people that won't get it .....there are people that stopped at the 2nd one when they realized what garbage it was, and the people that will keep getting it over and over, no one is going to change there mind at this point.
0	My last vaccine was over a year ago,  got Covid in October, got little faith in my own immunity   And not been at all the same since infected  And so we die by gaslight‚Ä¶.
0	Aside from all the other red flags I saw from the start, the nurses doing tik tok dances really nailed it for me, why would any human beings spend time coordinating dances when people were supposed to be dying right next to them?
0	You mistaken sinopharm with sinovac‚Ä¶ sinovac is the shittiest vaccine‚Ä¶
0	I got a letter in the mail the other day and some med clinic wanted to test the vaccine on my little sister and she's 3 years old. They would have given me 15,000 dollars and I was like hell no! I ain't taking no risk of my little sister dieing, no way no how!
1	Instead, we need to start a new pro-vaccine movement, taking inspiration from what we see in the fight against climate change.
1	Just got my 3rd booster yesterday, feeling fine, and feeling even better that I protected myself from the virus.  In a week or 2 I'm going to get my regular flu shot.
1	You're not invincible. Get #vaccinated or deal with me.
0	The vaccine is a hoax. Diet, exercise, sleep‚Ä¶ not a covid vaccine
1	Deny hospital services to unvaccinated people. It is their freedom to choose to be unvaccinated. It is also hospital‚Äôs freedom to accept them or not.
0	From the very beginning, at the first talks of a vax I said I would not be getting it because we wouldn‚Äôt know the side effects of it yet. Everyone in my family agreed... and then one by one everyone changed their mind except me and suddenly I was looked at as an idiot who watched too much YouTube and I could feel mine and my husbands family treating me different. I‚Äôve never really cared what they all think but I am starting to feel vindicated.
0	Read the comments and stories from here and many other sources. With what we know today, I would never get the vaccine. That is my personal choice. I‚Äôve seen too many healthy, young people that I personally know deal with clotting issues after being fully vaccinated.
1	I wanna get one more.
1	Level one of Covid-19 immunization has been complete. Level 2 will proceed in 28 days.
0	Nobody should be taking this poison, it's disgusting what's happening to the elderly!
1	It's very good to vaccinate every member of your against covid 19 pandemic when the need arises
1	Trust science, help each other, respect the rules, and get vaccinated. üíâ  #vaccinated https://t.co/KOyomQHMnS
1	I've had three family members die of covid within a month of them getting this *vaccine*. Not to mention how many people I know who have gotten covid right after they got the vaccine. No thank you.
0	I never had any symptoms until I got covid , now my heart is racing all day everyday . And I‚Äôm 32. This don‚Äôt happens with old people only . It‚Äôs happening with young too. I‚Äôm gonna have to go hospital again in a minute. Because it‚Äôs bad. Feels like you gonna have heart attack
0	I said no to compulsory vaccinations and to vaccinating young children
1	It gives you a 50% buff to your virus resistance stat
1	What she's saying is that nobody need die from COVID-19...especially when there's a proven vaccine that works...and that not getting vaccinated is ignorant
0	It‚Äôs getting harder and harder for them to deny what‚Äôs coming. Soon you won‚Äôt be able to look away.
0	The most common side effect is an inability to think clearly and a significant reduction in courage
0	The British people is so naive, why did they get the jab in the first place. That's the question. They blame the government but they should blame themselves instead. They're still sleeping.
1	My wife had 4 times, myself 0. We're both on Sinovac. My booster is AZ, hers Moderna.
0	When is MSN going to say; DON'T GET ANY MORE THESE JABS  ??????
1	People worldwide need to take this epidemic seriously and as I said before: I‚Äôm afraid or my biggest fear is that the world maybe doomed to extinction because of COVID inflicting the planet worldwide
1	Vaccination is a personal responsibility and social duty, let's all do our part to protect ourselves and others
0	My mother had 3. Now she fears her microwave. Of late, when she operates it, she said  her forehead gives off a pulling sensation, and she gets bad headaches afterwards,( she had countless up your nose-swab tests).  She sometimes become spontaneously unbalanced, like a Parkinson affected. My whole family too got injected. Some falling all over the place, one had a big tumor cut out the back, one had heart pain, pains all over the body, one developed MS, some beginning stage of kidney failure.
1	Every healthcare professional I interacted with and all of the hospital staff at the hospital I visit weekly got the vaccine and recommended I do the same. Call me a blind sheep, but if my doctor recommends me to do something related to health/medicine I do it.
0	The profits are safe and effective as compared to the product
1	The Vaccine is 100% safe and saves lives! Period
1	As a youngster in the 50s, before we had vaccines for these, here is what I had to suffer through: measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox. My mother had polio. After the vaccines, no one had to go through those awful illnesses. Am I vaccinated today? You bet I am. I am so grateful . I have had the vaccines for polio, diphtheria, pertussis, pneumonia, hepatitis, Tetanus, shingles, COVID, HPV, and every year the flu vaccine.
0	I finally have gotten omicron. My husband who got it in June has seemed to come out okay. We kept my grandson age six months while his parents had it. He wound up testing positive and running fever and was back to his normal self in three days. Right now I feel like I have a bad head cold. Some how my youngest and I who managed to avoid it when my husband got it are now the ones who are sick. I am actually kind of relieved! All of us have had the first two and then the first booster. We did not get the bivalent booster. Last shots 2021 October. We are in the US.
1	Vaccination is a critical step in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.
1	I am getting my Pfizer on saturday ... i beleive in people who are dedicated all their life to science, biology and educated. Its just strange how people with no education on the subject can come and comment here... let the professionals guide us ... please
0	Pure blood checking in‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt take this shot
0	I've known so many who have had terrible reactions and heart problem. Even several deaths  I'm so glad me and mine didn't get it!!!
1	My brother and SIL refuse to get the vaccine. I told them I will not come to their funerals if they die of Covid. As they are really dying of stupidity. And I live overseas and well, can't be bothered if they die from their own stupidity.
0	All my vaccinated friends are getting covid, getting really sick and ending up in hospital, even today - Great work vaccine...
1	we are seeing sudden deaths, BUT it's a known result of covid infection. I think these nutters are really frightened.
0	I truly feel for those who allowed themselves to be convinced or leveraged into taking it. I hope one day there will be justice.
0	also so my partner and I recently started couples therapy swear tg mostly over the shot (I won't get it) -- therapist has been mostly great until recently, when she tried to lecture me, in therapy, about the effectiveness of the shot
0	The conclusion is: the vaccines are more effective at preventing traffic accidents than they are at preventing infection of Covid
1	I was lucky to get first dose in January and yep I cried; multiple times! First step towards getting our (my family's) life back as I'm part of the immunocompromised community.
0	It's unconsitutional to force people to get vaccinated.
1	2nd #moderna shot done!
1	Get the booster.  Two of them... Don't mind these idiots..
0	No one needs this annual booster. Stop killing peoples immune system to give them extremely short lived antibodies for a virus that will give them the sniffles.
1	25."I'm hesitant to get the COVID vaccine because I don't know enough about it and I want to make an informed decision."
1	The only one person in my area who died from COVID.  She was an obese neighbor who got sick before the vaccine was created.  Meanwhile, several other neighbors got COVID after the vaccine came out.  None of them died and only had slight symptoms.  All of them were vaccinated.
1	Problem is the anti-vaxers are endangering others. Unvaccinated children should be home schooled.
0	I aint taking the vaxx if I got a million dollar
1	Remember 2019 when it seemed like everyone, regardless of politics, agreed that anti-vaxxers were morons? Back when they were spreading pseudoscience and debunked studies about vaccines causing autism? What the fuck happened?
0	I was sort of bullied into getting the vaccine by my doctor because I have an autoimmune disorder. Ever since I was vaccinated I haven‚Äôt felt right. One of the things that is obvious to me all the time is I got three shots in the same arm. (I got Covid are with the third shot. That‚Äôs a sort of rash where the injection was given.) But in the upper arm near my breast, I get this odd sensation one the side of my breast and the inside of my arm, where it feels like my arm and breast are sensitive to each other. It‚Äôs this constant annoying feeling that I have all the time. Of‚Äôcourse my doctor thinks I‚Äôm full of it. There is also this constant feeling of stress at the base of my skull. Of course the medical profession will say whatever is going on with me is unrelated to the vaccine. Listen, I am NOT telling anyone what to do. You‚Äôre all adults and need to make your own decision. But if I had it to do over, I would have only had the first two. But for me, the booster has made me feel strange.
0	I got the J&J vaccine and have had chest pain for about a month and a half now. I was not aware how unsafe these were. I wish I would have never done it
1	This vaccine should be safe.. taking it tomorrow.
0	These companies aren‚Äôt liable if your injured in the process. Stop and think about that!
0	HORROR: 6 month old baby boy #diedsuddenly ten days after receiving multiple vaccines, including the Covid-19 vaccine and Influenza vaccine.   He went for a nap and was found pulseless.
0	Jabs are a crime against humanity
1	Although I am still very young, I‚Äôm more politically active, which I mean in many ways. My father is a healthcare worker and got the vaccine in December of 2020. He was fine, just the normal sore arm, like you would get after a normal vaccine. After his second dose, he had caught a minor cold, but he got over it pretty quickly. While different people have different reactions, most people that I know that have gotten the vaccine were fine after their first dose, but after the second one, they had gotten a cold or fever. Nothing major. While my mother had just gotten the vaccine and is still waiting for her second dose, she hasn‚Äôt had anything severe happen to her. Again, I‚Äôm not old enough as the vaccine is 16+, I will be making the executive decision to get the vaccine. While I‚Äôm still a child, therefore this decision is not entirely mine, I would‚Äôve gotten it anyway. I know it would decrease the risk of COVID. So the simple answer is, yes. And I would recommend you do the same.
0	Why vaccinate healthy children???
1	While natural and holistic approaches can be a complement to traditional medicine, they are not a substitute for proven medical interventions
0	I AM NOT GOING TO BE A GUNIEA PIG!!!
1	I've been researching to discover which booster is best. I was initially vaccinated with Pfizer, so now I think sticking with Pfizer is a promising idea . However, after my 2nd vaccine I had all the malaise, fatigue, & myalgias along with a pretty profound allergic reaction. The reaction at first was limited to the arm, with localized urticaria & pruritus, soon to follow with systemic reactions, mostly, again pruritus. What I can't find in the literature is that does that reaction prohibit me from taking the Pfizer booster? Thanks for this no-nonsense, succinct, & straight to the point video.
0	Tell the truth about the vaccine deaths.
0	I remember listening radio. People were like " hi clement I'm so happy I got my jabüëèüëèüëè" . I had to lie to my sister to I got the vaccine and she was happy. Kkkkk. . well as it said " only the end justifies the means". ü§£
1	The vaccine has been extensively studied and is considered safe.
0	I'm totally against the convid19 injections they're not vaccines.
0	This helped me decide that I will not be taking the experimental jab!!  Thank you. !!
0	So relieved that I didn‚Äôt crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
1	And I for one, applaud their success. It wasn't easy with all of the misinformation and myths about vaccines coming from the right-wing.
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
0	Get us all vaccinated and then press the button to depopulate our entire world
0	‚ÄúA vaccine mandate just can‚Äôt be done here in America. People can‚Äôt be forced by the government to take it‚Äù
1	I have a severe needle phobia and have been low-key dreading getting vaccinated but I believe it is important. I finally managed to build up the courage and have an appointment to get vaccinated tomorrow afternoon. I so cannot way for it to be over so I can stop being afraid of it and relax for the rest of the year. I hope more people get it so we can get to a point where herd immunity is possible and we don't have to keep getting boosters yearly or whatever.
1	As a doctor myself, I have had an extreme reaction to a vaccine (anaphylaxis). But I have also have seen children with diseases that could have been prevented with a vaccine. Because of that, I make sure I do my due diligence, but my children are 100% vaccinated. Also because I have seen children with preventable diseases I will always make sure my patients have all information at their disposal before they make their choice.
0	What happened to our constitutional rights and our rights to privacy? We have the right to refuse this poison into our bodies!!
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Got my first vac today. I have to wait 3 wks for the second vac. Glad I'm getting it done. No more worries!
1	Please, take a moment to educate yourself before spreading misinformation about the vaccine. The side effects are well documented and have been shown to be temporary and mild
0	I sure don't want any vaccinated blood in me
0	The worst part is that they're STILL trying to push the vaxx propaganda today. They REALLY want that secret sauce inside everyone. No thanks.
1	A slight risk?  Covid has more than a slight risk of heart problems.  My uncle aged 82 just died of a heart attack caused by covid and an underlying condition.  I‚Äôll take the vaccine, thank you.
1	Clearly though, shouting down pro-vaxxers online is doing little to help the situation.
0	The pharma companies created covid to gain profits from vaccines!
1	I hope they can make a universal COVID vaccine. That would be awesome! If they did that with a flu vaccine, that would be great too!
1	Singapore approves    vaccine for local use. Vaccine safe to use on people aged 16 and above
1	Unfortunately, it's not just in the States where people are making this pandemic drag on because they don't want to lose their "freedoms". It's a problem here in Canada as well. If you watch this and you're still not convinced that vaccines save lives, then I have nothing to say to you.
1	These benefits will disappear when Biden (Covidiot-in-Chief) ends the Covid national and public health emergencies in May
1	It is no joke I am so glad and proud I listen to the medical professionals I have all my vaccines some people just don't get it they think they know more then the scientists that went to universities and studied hard to help us out smart people listen
1	the fastest developed and approved vaccine ever. Things that are done rushed are always good, I feel so safe to get it
1	Follow me if you want better my takes. Vaccines save lives.
0	According to a Facebook post by his wife, Heidi Neckelmann, doctors tried a number of procedures to rescue her husband, but none succeeded.
0	so far I have never heard of anyone regretting not taking the vaccine..
0	I live in a blue state ofc and plan on moving as soon as possible so I won't ever have to be forced to take a jab again.
1	proudly fully vaccinated. Why? Because vaccines work!
0	Don‚Äôt want to be part of your experiment thanks!
0	How about boosting your immune system with diet and exercise?  Also many of the ‚Äúunderprivileged‚Äù have one thing in common, a lack of vitamin D which is extremely inexpensive.
1	First, although pro-vaccination clusters are smaller numerically (that is, have a minority total size, and have ideologically fringe opinions, anti-vaccination clusters have become central in terms of the positioning within the network .
1	I think about how COVID-19 just burned through the world and exposed how horrendous late capitalism has rotted the support beams of society and how useless the for-profit US healthcare system is and I shudder to think how society and my little family would handle avian flu with a 60% mortality rate.
0	My company "unofficially" required the vaccine to work there, i was one of two that held out and had a few very carefully worded meetings with the owner. I'm still unvaxed and proud of it.
1	Unvaccinated people are going to keep creating new variants of Coronavirus until one finally kills all of us. Since black people have the most preexisting conditions, we are and will, continue to be the first ones to die. Our fears, as valid as they are, are going to be the end of us.
0	The vaccine is KILLING people. What part of that don't some people get. In their 100's daily people are randomly dropping dead Here in the UK we are seeing 2,000 more sudden deaths per week than the average & it all began a few months after the first vaccine rollout WAKE UP!
0	targeting parents with the fear/guilt of their kids getting covid...duh...you would put that stuff in your very young kids? hope you don't ever have any
0	That these developments alone aren‚Äôt cause for an immediate halt to the mass vaccinations, as well as thorough investigations, is astonishing.
1	Fully vaxxed and boosted. Don't regret a thing
1	My cousin just died on the 6th from covid. Family members are saying she was sick before. I believe if she would have been vax she would of made it. I feel so sad for all that have lost their life for believing all these people that are shell we say crazy?.
1	@alumilynn Doesn‚Äôt matter, Portugal had mRNA and has the same adult vaccination rates (95-98%) and has had the same low rates of infection now #covid19vaccine
0	got my first shot. Feeling incredibly sick. Throw up, fatigue and soreness. Posted that on facebook and got told that the vaccine doesnt cause you to get sick and I was banned for 24 hours lol
1	Let‚Äôs do this country great people, get your vaccine, wear a mask, use hand sanitizer, stay away from big crowds for now , what is so fucking hard about that , people in this country need to get it together.
0	I'm so happy to see all these people resist this poison
1	Second dose for me yesterday. Such lovely comments on here too
0	It's all about controlling/using fear.
1	Man i fucking hate the metro stops. This guy started talking to me about how "they" are brainwashing us with the covid vaccines and that electronic payment is just a setup to remove phisical currency so that "they" can control the world by shutting down the infrastructure and we can't use money anymore
1	Why dont UsA compare its covid performance to asian countries and australia? Quite highly vaccinated and theyve had small amounts of vaccine injury, but incredibly small mortality from covid.
0	Don't care still not taking it
1	COVID -19 hospitalizations look different in the Omicron wave, and vaccination status is playing a part. We need to address the unvaccinated!
0	Bill gates made Covid vaccines so he can stick me on his fridge and you can‚Äôt convince me otherwise
1	No vaccine in the world can be 100% https://t.co/7b1l9WiZNA
1	Meanwhile, virtually everyone I know got the vaccine (and booster) and are fine. Not a one dropping dead or going into weird convulsions.
0	I just don't like being experimented on
0	Hell NO & I‚Äôm never getting it. It‚Äôs causing Myocarditis & many other issues
1	Feeling hopeful after getting my vaccine shot
0	This is not the usual jab.   It‚Äôs all lies.  Ask questions.  Where is the list of ingredients  Where is the proof of claim that there is Korona.
1	As cases of respiratory viruses continue to decline, I would like to thank you for playing your part in getting us safely through this season. Remember, vaccines save lives.
1	I'm a nurse and I recall being swayed to the antivax side early on in my career because another nurse had a strong stance against them and was very vocal about it. I happened to go online and found the list of adverse reactions that had been reported. What I didn't look at was the frequency of them. They are rare, but I didn't know at the time. I had questions and felt uneasy about getting the flu shot and the fact that I had already vaccinated my kids (who are perfectly healthy btw). Then one day in a work education class she was met with the strong advocation for vaccination and I was suddenly watching a debate unfold. After that, I was embarrassed I ever considered vaccines were a bad idea. People's words can be so powerful, we truly have to be careful who we choose to listen to. Trusted sources or passionate victim of a rare adverse reaction.

1	Please stop spreading misinformation.
1	I checked about this yesterday, and my bivalent booster was in September, the one for us "old people" over 65. So I am okay. Stay safe, people -- get the vaccine or your booster. Don't be stupid and uncaring. Thank you.
0	I think that as more data and post Mortem revelations are made public the safety signal will rise significantly for those that knowingly mandated this biotech weapon and heads will have to roll to establish trust in the health care system again.
1	Vacced and proud
0	Why on earth would you get a 4th booster if it doesn't stop transmission or infection and causes myocarditis?
0	took 2 and sufferd ever since never again & had covid 2 time
1	I hope they make the vaccine mandatory so all these nut jobs don't ruin it for the rest of us
0	Vaccines are not natural and contain harmful ingredients like mercury and aluminum. I prefer to boost my immune system with healthy living.

0	‚ÄúThe vaccines do not protect our children from becoming infected with Omicron. They do not prevent infected children from infecting others. In contrast, the pharmaceutical companies and the government are almost fully protected from any damages these products might cause them. ‚ÄúIf your child is damaged by these vaccines, you will be left alone with both your grief and the burden of care. These genetic vaccines can damage your children. They may damage their brains, their heart, their immune system, and their ability to have children in the future.

1	I‚Äôve been in the ICU for my mother not related to COVID and I‚Äôve heard the scream crying of family when they find out their loved one doesn‚Äôt make it because of complicated from COVID it‚Äôs heartbreaking. I wish people could just experience what it‚Äôs like on the frontlines to truly understand why it‚Äôs important to get vaxxed. No one in that ICU with COVID was vaxxed that should be a tell. Thank god for those nurses and docs ‚ù§Ô∏è healing for everyone
1	Hopefully we‚Äôve learned to get vaccinated, wear masks when appropriate and maintain physical distance.
0	i know 2 people that have gotten covid and died after the vax and a few have had bell's palsy and one had a stroke. I would never get the vax and i pray daily for my loved ones and friends that have been vaccinated. So sad.
0	What a crock of BS! Tell this guy and his family how good the vaccine worked for him. Paralyzed from taking that position. https://youtu.be/ukHsvjCw6Wo
0	Similar story here. Pre-third shot, husband was 2xVaxxed. He got the ‚ÄòVID. Was very sick, needed monoclonal antibodies (which absolutely helped). Me? Not vaxxed. One day of a fairly miserable headache and my already horrible allergies got a bit worse. I worked (from home) all of my scheduled hours and took care of him. We slept in the same bed. We kissed, and all of the other things married people do, while he was symptomatic (but obviously pre-severely ill).  Strange stuff.
0	I'd rather take my chances with natural immunity than risk the side effects of vaccines.
1	Let's not let COVID-19 defeat us. We can slow its spread by following guidelines and getting vaccinated when it's our turn. #EndCOVID
1	Just had it. Was brutal. Was very close to going into hospital. Had vaccine in May and did not get the most recent one that came out in the fall and wish I had. The other time I got it didn‚Äôt even have symptoms after vaccination. It‚Äôs definitely not gone away.

0	I lost my appetite after getting the vaccine.
1	I booked my two vaccinations today. I am so glad to be able to be vaccinated.
0	You are still considered "unvaccinated" up to 14 days after you get a jab. Most adverse effects occur within two or three days of getting the jab, ergo, that "unvaccinated" number is full of people who got the jab within 14 days.
0	How dare you peddle you this misinformation. Getting vaccinated doesn‚Äôt help anybody else
1	We will now have a family christmas together with all my grandparents. I can only thank the vaccine for the fast passing of covid-19 worries.
0	Had covid was not that bad now I'm immune! No way I would put that in my body!
0	Where is the research into what is happening? Why are so many people dying now?  After a pandemic death rates are supposed to go down, because the most vulnerable have sadly died.  Is it lockdown having affected immune systems? Weight put on, because most of us voluntarily imprisoned ourselves? NEVER AGAIN.
0	The potential for Covid 19 vaccines to cause more harm than good is enormous. Who knows what the long-term effects will be?
1	What is it talking about with the "first vaccine injured payout" please tell me there isn't actually anything like that happening? They are just full of shit there right?
1	As a nurse and a former Pre-med major, I am fully aware of the benefits of vaccination. I already have both of my Covid-19 vaccines and had absolutely no reaction to either of them other than a sore arm which only lasted a day, just like any other vaccinations. I am definitely a proponent of getting vaccinated and I believe/hope that when more people are vaccinated than are not, we will see a lot of the restrictions lifted and we won't have to wear masks anymore. I hope anyone reading this decides to get vaccinated as soon as they are able to!
1	Don‚Äôt want to be stopped from going to the mall? Take the damn vaccine!
1	VACCINES SAVE OUR LIVES!
0	What the use of getting the injection when you can still get the virus and also transmit it to others
1	There is a lot of data. It looks very good in terms of T cells, antibodies, etc. The bivalvent boosts immunity to covid substantially. Doctors are also seeing a lot of vaxxed people with covid have very mild cases.
1	Beyond grateful that i have been offered this opportunity as a healthcare worker.
1	To all the teams locally involved in rolling out C-19 vaccination. You are doing an amazing job...Thank you.BBC News - Covid-19 vaccine: First person receives Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine in UKhttps://t.co/URPovxx2hg
1	If you don't get vaccinated you or someone you know could get covid and that is often something you won't enjoy
1	I have lost so many friends who refused the vaccine and not one who got the vaccine. Any imperfections with the vaccine would be far better than going to friends‚Äô funerals.
1	I got covid as I didn't get the vaccine in time. I didn't die but coughing like crazy with a blood oxygen level of 88%, sleeeping 16 hours a day, diarrhea, loss of smell and taste etc for 2 weeks is something I never want to experience again and I didn't have any pain killers when I was in labor for 37 hours with my eldest.
1	Protecting myself and those around me was my main priority, and getting vaccinated was the best way to do so.
1	I got vaccinated for rubeola when i was a baby, yet I got rubeola when i was 14 years old. Neither my family nor I blamed "the vacc didn't work", it's just my immune was bad at that time. Still doesn't change my mind about getting vacc, a jab it is.
0	mRNA = Biohazard
1	Oh, and I WILL be getting more of their vaccines. That‚Äôs a promise.
1	this will indeed help people get vaccinated and stop falling for false rumors form media and news. its outrageous
1	The distrust of vaccine is beyond reasoned thought.  It is an emotional response to misinformation deliberately published to a specific political group. Directly dealing with the misinformers is needed by legal means.
1	More amazing Covid vaccine news!! https://t.co/RHeMmYOp8U
1	I don‚Äôt want to get COVID.
0	Thankful to be here and still unvaccinated. The side effects are staggering, go watch the documentary "Died Suddenly". Hope all are doing well!
0	I got the vaccine and the next day I felt like sh!t, I couldn‚Äôt breathe properly and I felt so soar. I say u don‚Äôt got to get the vaccine as long as u take every precaution serious, such as wearing mask, gloves, using hand sanitizer and etc. U should be fine.

1	Basically - the more things 'work out,' the more conspiracy theories have to be used to stand by anti-vaxxer beliefs. Honestly, 'emergency approval' did sound a little scary, but now that it is fully approved, what will be said opposing the vaccine will be nothing but non-sense.
1	Green light for universal COVID-19 vaccine project   A universal vaccine that could bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic is now in development at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research.

0	They continue to spread these allegations, for example, using the fact that there are liability protections for COVID-19 vaccines to imply the vaccines are dangerous.
1	I got vaccinated to support our healthcare system and the ongoing fight against the virus.
1	He's literally legislating a platform to kill people.
0	Checking back in to let you know I'm still unvaccinated and have a robust natural immunity to COVID.  Told ya so.
1	I‚Äôve had five shots. The last one - Pfizer bivalent - in November. I‚Äôll get as many as they‚Äôll give me.
1	Vaccines can sometimes cause serious side effects. My sister had a severe reaction to the pertussis vaccine when she was a baby, so she has to get tetanus boosters without pertussis included. She still gets her other shots, despite severe needle phobia.
0	25. "I believe getting vaccinated is a civic duty and helps protect others."
1	It‚Äôs not even a vaccine vaccines provide immunity last I checked this ‚Äúshot‚Äù does not
1	Vaccination, for example, is the reason we no longer have polio crippling people in our population. The outbreak in NY was in a community of people opposed to vaccination and so these were susceptible. It is worthwhile to note that (spoken as a recently retired RNA virologist) that the COVID virus populations, while mutating all the time, have become less and less virulent. High mutation rates are to be entirely expected with RNA viruses while lesser virulence speaks to no requirement by the virus for that trait as it already is quite good and replicating and spreading. These viruses will become just one more of the many humans around the world will see, probably annually, like flu and others and yes, there will always be some severe cases/deaths but overall, the strains that circulated in 2020 and 2021 are history now, not to return. Be of good cheer, get vaccinated, and of course take whatever health precautions you deem necessary for you and yours.
1	I encourage everyone to get it to protect ourselves and others.
0	I'll take my vaccine in 55 years. The same amount of time I need to know the data, studies, and everything in this bubbling cauldron.
1	God Bless you Scientist. I salute to your endeavors
1	It's impossible for an unvaccinated person who hasn't had COVID to have any immunity from COVID.
0	The COVID19 vaccine does NOT!!!!! protect vaccinate people from getting covid nor does it prevent the spread of it, so what good is it????
0	Funny how the comments have been shut down on that clip, like they're trying to hide something like THE VACCINE CAN KILL YOU ... HMMMMM...
0	So you state that you are injecting 3000 death shots daily. IT'S A GENOCIDE and You MASS MURDERS will be accountable for every vaccine injuries and vaccine deaths shortly
0	no-one will !force" me to take an untested so-called-"vaccine"
0	I regret getting my two shots.
1	I mean, what possible incentive would Pfizer have to lie about vaccine data, create preferable Covid strains, and pay off the media with huge ad budgets to silence any negative coverage?! Just shutup and get your (profit) booster, peasants!
1	Getting vaccinated is not just about protecting ourselves, but also those around us. Let's all do our part!
0	There are no credible data to prove the long-term safety and efficacy of this vaccine. At this stage, it‚Äôs still experimental, even if all regulatory approvals are in place.
0	My son got pericarditis three days after his second jab. No underlying health problems. He‚Äôs a very healthy young man who exercises in the form of jogging sometimes.
1	Oh, I'm not sticking up for big pharma, at all.  Their vaccine works, it saves lives.  That's all their is.
1	Get Vaccinated!
0	By not taking the jab, I'm 100% safe from side effects and 99% safe from covid.
1	I'm provaccination , but freedom of choice should never be taken away from people. I vaccinate because I want to. If someone doesn't want to, then respect that and move on to someone who wants.
0	Dr 'Sucharit Bhakdi' COVID-19 Vaccine Destroys Hearts & Brains of Billions of People
0	Every Unvaccinated person has no regrets not taking the vaccine. However many Vaccinated people now have regrets taking the vaccine.
0	I don't trust the government, and I think that the COVID-19 vaccine is part of some sort of conspiracy.
0	The vaccinated are now blaming the unvaccinated for not ‚Äúwarning them enough.‚Äù
1	I have to be in a sort of a vaccinated quarantine. That virus was no joke but the Moderna vax is why I am fine.
1	They shoulda gotten vaxxed.
0	If there's nothing to hide, investigate should be welcomed with open arms.
1	Hi l'm from Bangladesh i had my first dose of the pfizer 13/01/2022 Everything is fine no side effects or anything!
1	The kids on TikTok have had enough LMAO! Get vaccinated. Get boosted. Don‚Äôt believe the dumb stuff.
1	There is absolutely NO reason not to have it and the benefits to you personally and to society in general way outweigh the tiny, tiny, tiny risks of any side effects.
0	Again more propaganda. When will people learn that this vaccine equals death.
0	I had never gotten it until my vaccinated son got it and gave it to me ü•∫
0	So many people having serious issues is scary! I think I would rather get Covid.
0	With every shot my mother‚Äôs brain has significantly deterioratedüò≠üíî
1	Nobody cares. I look forward to reading about your death in the Herman Cain Awards. And I'll laugh at stupid taking itself out.
1	Just your daily reminder that vaccines are brilliant!
0	As an unvaccinated 51 y.o. who has contracted Covid twice over the past 3 years (alpha and omicron), I am offended that people in their 50s are considered vulnerable.   Natural immunity works great when you take good care of yourself.
1	Died suddenly is a desperate attempt to get people to watch the latest trash documentary meant to grift antivaxxers and the Gullible right.
0	Fk off with all of your vaccines
1	I hope this wakes people up to the value of¬†vaccines, too. There are so many whackos out there that think that¬†vaccines¬†are a scam
1	I think EVERYONE should be vaccinated. I also know young, previously healthy people who are suffering from long Covid. Plus, I believe in doing our best to help others stay well.
0	Doctors amount to being drug dealers for the drug companies. Once I held them in such high esteem. Now, they are on a par with the ones we lock up. Worse really.
0	I haven't & never will
0	This whole 3 years of "covid" has been nothing short of criminal.
1	The need to understand the psychological mechanisms underlying the active involvement of the pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine movements is therefore very important both from a theoretical and practical perspective.
0	I am not vaccinated the Lord who vaccinated me Thanks To HIM I'm healthy He's my healer
0	florida already said nope not happening here. there is not enough known about the effects of these shots 10 years from now
0	As long as i‚Äôm given the right to file a lawsuit should any serious side-effects occur i‚Äôll gladly take it ASAP. If neither moderna or pfizer can promise that then sorry, no dice. I won‚Äôt pay money out of my own pocket to take something which has clearly been rushed and statistically speaking is no more effective at preventing infection than my own immune system is.
0	Is anyone still fucking dumb enough to take any of that shit? Amazing
0	who signed up for the "trial"?... or did they just use us all without permission?
1	While vaccine-critical activism has been widely documented and discussed, comparatively little has been said about the concerted response of pro-vaccine activists defending the majority view.
1	Can‚Äôt wait for my turn
1	If we help our immune system fight the new coronavirus. It could of saved humanity from dieing out more quickly than before. If we all develop the vaccine together we could of saved humanity from ending.
0	Just want wish good luck to all the people out there participating in the experimental vaccine trial
1	So grateful for the vaccine! Let's protect each other and bring an end to this pandemic
1	I am fully vaccinated and the peace of mind I feel is the opposite of the helplessness I felt for so long. Living with a fully vaccinated person as well. I'm very grateful.
1	amen I want to be vaccinated too
1	I got my second Pfizer dose in January. I'm still overweight, but otherwise healthy.
0	China is winning a covert war without firing a shot. At the current rate of die-off from mRNA spike protein injections, Western countries will be decimated and easily taken over.
1	Just got my vaccine today! Feeling really good and happy. Stay safe everyone <3
1	I'm sick of the rants about the COVID vaccine causing myocarditis. The COVID virus itself causes myocarditis 100 times more often than the vaccine itself. Literally! This means that if you are really afraid of myocarditis then you should DEFINITELY get vaccinated. Good Tuesday!
1	They refuse to wear masks, they refuse to get vaccinated, but demand that we open everything. They‚Äôd rather kill all of us than be responsible members of society. Fucking bullshit.
1	We love seeing people we know get the vaccine! So exciting!
1	I got the vaccine and this really crazy thing happened to me! I still got COVID. Except this time, it didn‚Äôt send me to the ER 3 times and I didn‚Äôt develop pneumonia. I did NOT remain sick for 3 straight months! I didn‚Äôt lose 3 months of work. What the fuck?!
0	It‚Äôs far less safe than it is effective‚Ä¶
0	Thank god i never took it.
0	49-year-old U.S. #senator who suffered tragic #stroke was fully #vaccinated and #boosted https://t.co/fBB2zlblLK https://t.co/NFnXxMpAF8
1	Damn. My city is going to get the vaccine in two days or three. Everyone is taking vaccine here. Hope everything goes well.
0	Thank you! Now maybe people will see just how fucking stupid you "Vaxxers" have been and see the truth for what it really is! lol!
0	The Covid 19 mRNA bioweapon (disguised as a vaccine) is designed to make people sterile and automatically die within 2-3 years! Recently, pharmaceutical companies have made all vaccines into mRNA biological weapons.
0	No long term side effects? How can any human possibly know that?
0	Could you do a video about the side effects? Spinal cord inflammation, Autoimmune disease, etc.
1	You can enjoy life a lot better without health problems from COVID. That is why I got vaccinated.
1	Another graduate of:  "The Dunning Kruger School for Advanced Medicine and Virology"
1	Ahhh yes, the classic ‚ÄúObama divided the country.‚Äù Haven‚Äôt heard that one in a while. The gall of a qualified black man running for President in the 21st century, eh? Look Ivar McTin, it‚Äôs not his fault that you‚Äôre a redneck racist motherfucker who fell down the Fox News rabbit hole ass first.Have fun on the ventilator, pal. Thoughts and prayers asshole
0	Some individuals have concerns about sacrificing their child for the larger population
0	I can keep my costs down by eliminating the risks factors. I can avoid covid by monitoring my behavior. Lowering the risks. But the costs from getting injured by the vaccines, I have no control over. From the injuries I see too high a price to pay.
0	The LORD is watching all this....woe to the wicked...and to the idle shepherd.... Psalm 10 KJV 1 Why standest thou afar off, O Lord? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? 2 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. 3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth. 4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts. 5 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them. 6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity. 7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity. 8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor. 9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. 10 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. 11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it. 12 Arise, O Lord; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble. 13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. 14 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless. 15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none. 16 The Lord is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land. 17 Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: 18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress. Psalm 2:4 KJV 4He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. Romans 10:13 KJV 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. JESUS IS LORD No matter what you have done, there is salvation and forgiveness in the LORD JESUS...
0	Having an autistic child (glyphosate exposure) where none of the conventional "therapies" work. Having my own vaxx exemptions stripped during the pandemic. Hard times but it also brought me closer to Christ and my eyes were opened.
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
1	I‚Äôm a lab worker whose hospital just got a bunch of vaccines. Can‚Äôt wait
0	God bless you Dr. Spread the truth.  My brother got myocarditis after the jab. He almost died.  He was only 43.  Healthy.  These pharmaceutical companies need to be held accountable.
1	I‚Äôm sorry I disagree, free vaccination is a privilege! There is no evidence any AZ risk are even on the same continent as the risks from Covid for over 60‚Äôs.
0	You laugh now but I bet in like 30-40 years you'll feel the consequences - back pains, worse sight, hair loss, numerous health problems in general. Meanwhile our 100% natural, unvaccinated family won't have any of those!
0	I'm not taking it because I like the fact that you can't tell me what to do. And there's so much satisfaction from that, it's priceless.
0	#HPV vaccine is #Dangerous there have been serious complications even death but #media is silent
1	I'm booking my booster jab right now my guy I am high risk and should of done so weeks ago.
1	Vaccination is a key tool in controlling the spread of COVID-19 and bringing an end to the pandemic
1	I just got my first vaccine today. No side effects so far. Thank you to all the scientists and researchers around the world for making the vaccine available this early and thank you for this channel for spreading the science. Yes, it‚Äôs definitely OK to be smart. Science rules!!!!
1	Yes get the second dose. You do NOT want Covid on top of what you already have
0	Sad and I am all against the Covid jabs but I did see an article in which his parents suspected drug overdose. We would never know. RIP.
1	I‚Äôm so glad my little 6 year old granddaughter got her booster and flu shot.
0	So 7 members of my family have taken the poison, 3 of which are now fallen seriously ill all for the last 4 months . There is no coincidence!
0	I'm glad my family doctor said I didn't need the vaccine.
0	the corona vaccine in so dumb I will never take it
0	There is nothing ‚Äúcredible ‚Äú coming from WHO anymore!
0	One thing not to do before taking covid vaccin is absolutely not taking covid vaccin. !!!!
0	Thanks Doc for all the effort you put into your research. As far as anymore vaccines, they can shove them.
0	I was prepared to scrap it all, including my career before I took that crap. I knew what it was.
1	Vaccine and mask mandates saves lives. I‚Äôm proud that NYC is taking the pandemic seriously and implementing these needed restrictions.
0	All this shows me is that we can either get this over quickly or draw it out twice as long. I‚Äôd rather just get it over with.  So yeah, whatever, it‚Äôs like the flu or something.
1	It has been 3 years since #Covid has been present in our communities   The best way to protect yourself against the virus is to get #vaccinatedüëâ https://t.co/nshsPAJK5l   Nurse Toyin - better known as Lady T - helped launch St George's covid vaccine clinic‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/oVVjYzcYdn
1	To each his own. Vaccine saves lives. I trust the science not Facebook scientists.
0	There are no benefits just more money for big pharma
1	I think once everyone who wants the vaccine can get it, we no longer have to worry about restrictions to protect the unvaccinated. They've accepted the risk.
1	congrats anti-vaxers you won
1	Vaccines saves lives and means jobs and growth. First World countries have eradicated smallpox and Polio from its population due to widespread vaccinations.
0	ü§£ü§£ü§£ I took the Vaccine because of work. If I don't laugh I'm gonna cry
0	What scares me most about this is there is a No Liability Clause which means I cant sue them and recieve compensation for any damages that might be caused by this even up to death
0	If the vaccine was so good why was there ever a mandate? They are lying to us, wake up!!!!
1	#DeltaVariant is coming for you don‚Äôt be stupid, get vaccinated NOW!
0	Then we find out you still can get sick with the vaccine. Then we find out you still can spread Covid with the vaccine. I dunno - I regret getting it at this point
0	In Puerto Rico, for children‚Äôs are a promotion using Elmo, saying, ‚Äú is ok to have chest pain,‚Äù when the reality is, children‚Äôs don‚Äôt suffer from any chest pain.
1	when many of you FB experts get severely ill or die I sure hope that you don't expect anyone to feel sorry for you and please treat yourself since you know it all!
1	Well he died from a drug overdose but why let facts get in the way right? Do you also think that anyone that died from a traffic accident is the fault of the vaccine if they died young? Is that how it works with you?
1	I'm honestly surprised these things aren't escorted by military convoy considering how wild and irrationally violent so many anti-vaxxer, covid-hoax, anti-masker and 'plandemic' nutjobs there are in the US...
0	I too have noticed that the vaccinated people in my life are getting sick and the un-vaccinated are not getting sick. Why would I take a 'vaccine' that doesn't stop infection or transmission? What they are calling a vaccine is actually an mRNA therapy that supposedly lessens the severity of covid (lol).  My father in-law is 73, has cancer and somehow got covid-19. He is also 'unvaccinated', but he is 100% fine now, as far as covid goes. He hung out with us multiple times and we never got sick.  Also, based on your post here, I don't think your partner is being fair to you. Not one bit.
0	Take some vitamin D like it‚Äôs wintertime, gargle with whiskey or mouthwash if you get a sore throat, those things work for viral infections. Don‚Äôt get the spike, it‚Äôs bad for you.
0	I can‚Äôt imagine being one of the people‚Ä¶right now‚Ä¶that submitted to a deadly bioweapon vaccine‚Ä¶for a free donut, fries, or hamburger.
1	I am absolutely getting a vaccine as soon as I can, preferably Pfizer or Moderna.
0	My brother just got out of the hospital for a very large blood clot in his brain! No fall and he didn‚Äôt hit his head! The neurosurgeon said there was a tiny tear above his frontal lobe! The blood clot was the size of a grapefruit and a half. My brother will make a full recovery üôèüèª he had 2 vaccines (didn‚Äôt want it but was bullied by his job)  üòï and is young and healthy! He is VERY LUCKY to still be with us! üòä
0	During a vaccination session: Patient: Does it guarantee immunity ? Doctor: Only for the manufacturers.
1	My boyfriend is a polio survivor, if he had access to vaccines and could go back in time to take it he would. Side effects happen, but are often far less disruptive and dangerous to life than the actual disease. Its sad that this is even an argument.
0	I now have blood cancer. Thanks Pfizer
1	Some people can't get the vaccine, which is why the rest of us need to stay up to date on ours and wear masks when possible.
0	How come no one talks about the politicians that file and receive covid fund. All people that receive fund be investigate.
1	Getting vaccinated is an act of selflessness. You're not just protecting yourself, you're also protecting those who are most vulnerable.
0	Can you please explain why people who are double and triple vaxed are still contracting the virus and getting sick from it? Considering your description of how the vax works :)
0	Dont take the booster if you value your life at all
0	I‚Äôve never had the shot and my family did and my gfs family got it. They all had Covid twice and I‚Äôm here without the vaccine and I‚Äôve never had Covid even when my gf who lives with me had it twice!
1	i'm more than excited to get vaccinated! and because of this video, i'm more than determined to share this towards my family and friends. kudos to the team behind this video!
0	If you want to get the mRNA vaccine, knock yourselves out. I'm taking a hard pass.
1	They took the shorter route, but if we want to overcome this epidemic, we must rely on vaccines.
0	12 days after my second Pfizer I was developing a massive DVT in my left leg. Living the dream
1	Vaccinate your children. Even the worst effects of vaccines are better than the best of many illnesses that they prevent.
1	I fking HATE anti vaxers, if I see one in real life I‚Äôm liable to lose my shit. My mums got leukaemia and these scum bags are risking her life for their own pathetic political agenda.
0	THE VAX IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH, BEWARE!!!!!!!
0	I can't help but feel so vindicated for my decision about this topic. I too had a work contract end because of my decision and up until that point, was thwarted from using my creative skills to help others and directly told this was because "you haven't had the v*ccine"!! Today I am happy and healthy.  I do not feel above anyone who decided to take the jab(s), the freedom to choose is more important than that. I do think that freedom to choose can also be funnelled  by propaganda influencing the narratives at the time. Thanks Dr Campbell üôè
0	I completely agree that censorship of certain viewpoints is a problem. We should be able to hear and consider all sides of an argument, including those of us (me included) who don't want to take the vaccine.
1	the vaccination protects against multiple strains of covid. It would be stupid to not get it
0	I am 68 years old,  not vaccinated, never had Covid and perfectly healthy.  In my county we were put under house arrest, discriminated and pressured worse than in any authoritarian regime but we stood our ground and I a  so happy we did.
1	Oh I love this! Please post more of the crying antivax post!!!
1	the graphics shown also helps in better understanding about the vaccine's roles. thanks! i'll show this video with my friends and family and those antivax
1	I will be getting the vaccine for sure
1	Vaccines are the ultimate power-up in our fight against COVID-19. Let's level up and beat this virus together. #VaccinesSaveLives #COVIDVaccine
0	Robbie, just go and get all the boosters to see if it works. This is the first time people demanded you prove to them it was dangerous to them and not prove to them that it was good for them. Literally an episode from the twilight zone.
1	I will gladly get my vaccine
1	Covid bad, vaccine good... and lying for the good is justified
1	3 shots, sinopharm. People all around me tested positive, but i never did...
0	going by the past 12 months yoga would probably give you better covid protection than the vaccines
0	Who the hell is still getting shots?
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why anyone would give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually.
1	I‚Äôm not angry that the unvaccinated are keeping me out of restaurants and movie theaters. I‚Äôm angry that they don‚Äôt care if my preschooler or grandma get sick and die.
0	"Covid vaccine is 100% safe and effective." "There is no evidence that blood from a vaccinated donor can cause any harm." - Same guy.
0	wel  she  take the  mac of  the  beast  if  you  take  the  mac   you  sell  your  soul  to  the  devil
0	Studies suggest a link between a rapidly progressing, incurable and fatal prison disease known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease and COVID-19 vaccines.
1	Congrats! Looking forward to your updates following the vaccination.
0	Too bad they don‚Äôt work like any other vaccine. BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ‚ÄúVACCINES‚Äù!
0	The vaccine injured deserve to be seen, heard ; believed.   @FAANews ‚Äì are you aware of the COVID-19 vaccine injuries in the aviation industry?   My letter highlights five of these severe adverse events experienced by pilots ; an air traffic controller.
0	You‚Äôll eventually only be allowed on the Internet if you‚Äôre up to date with Covid vaccines
1	Vaccines save lives. Period.
0	Crimes against humanity!
0	Because I am anti-over-medication philosophy, especially non-essential vaccines and drugs, I am not sure what effect over-intervention will have on autoimmunity, especially again, vaccines that cannot be prevented
1	It is sad to see how some people so quickly choose to believe uneducated conspiracy theorists on the internet over educated doctors and scientists. One question: When was the last time any conspiracy theorist has been correct about something???
1	It's heartbreaking to see the toll that this pandemic has taken on our healthcare workers, and it's time for us to step up and show them that they're not in this fight alone. By getting vaccinated, we're not only protecting ourselves and those around us, but we're also reducing the spread of the virus and giving healthcare workers one less thing to worry about. Let's show them that we appreciate all they do by taking the vaccine and doing our part.
0	anti-vax people still alive is the only proof needed that the vax was a scam.
0	Here we see that there is such a HUGE difference between intelligence, education, and discernment. The discerning knew that the narrative was a lie from the pandemic onset.
1	Yup this. The vaccine is going to be rushed out the door. I‚Äôm definitely waiting at least 3-6 months before my family and I take it.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	When they say,  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to share our vaccine status,‚Äù do they know that it has just been revealed to us by them saying that?
1	It's amazing how millions have taken the vaccine at this point but somehow people aren't dropping like flies all over the place. Oh, and that some of the loudest voices against the vaccine have gotten the shot.
0	This is exactly where I was afraid of two years ago. My gut feeling told me not to get vaccinated. Thank God I listened.
0	Do as you want. As for me and mine, we have no reason to participate in this experiment. Either lots of people are gonna kill their kids with this unnecessary treatment, or they aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not worth the risk for my family. My choice doesn‚Äôt impact anyone else so get over it.
0	Thank God I never took this poison.
0	Is a short term fix that will create long term problems
0	My son is 23, my daughter is 14, I‚Äôm 52. Never had any shots! No food allergies, no nothing! Most of my kids friends have all different types of issues. I‚Äôll pass on this drug everyday.
0	Who's still unvaccinated? Unvaccinated people are Geniuses
0	Interesting how Omicron went from behaving like a common cold and being a manageable illness, to causing heart & neurological issues. Also Interesting, is that in between it changing from one thing to the other, there was the booster roll-out
0	This is how the Psyop works.  It‚Äôs a methodical, consistent, barrage of fear porn.  If you have survived the psyop without getting the jab, I salute you,  You are mentally strong, a free thinker, and a person of character. Follow back.
1	I'm all in favor of the vaccine. It‚Äôs one of the great achievements, a true miracle, and not only for the United States. We‚Äôre saving tens of millions of lives throughout the world. We‚Äôre saving entire countries.
1	my 12 year old got their second dose this morning, and that makes all three of us now fully vaccinated! Two weeks until full effectiveness, but still! We have an immunocompromised kid in our family and have been in total isolation for 469 days. Feb 27th 2020 we went into lockdown. Now we are almost free!
0	There is two issues, the first is should they have accelerated this vaccine or not, but also how soon did the Phamaceuticals know there was issues and why did they not tell us!!!
0	I'm really not comfortable having a messenger RNA vaccine being tried in such dire situation - also, it might be taking advantage of the current situation to push it through.
0	27/6/21 and still surviving without taking the Covid vaccine. I'm the only one in my family that insisted on not injecting that thang in my body!
0	Can you please explain why people who are double and triple vaxed are still contracting the virus and getting sick from it? Considering your description of how the vax works :)
1	If you are correct, it is the biggest scandal in all of History of medicine. But if you are wrong, your influence is directly responsible for hundreds, if not thousands, of easily avoidable hospitalisations and/or deaths.  Are you truly willing to die on that hill, Peter ?
1	I was one too until my daughter tested positive for Covid-19. Thank god I tested negative days later but that was my wake up call from God to do the right thing for yourself and get the vaccine, it‚Äôs not the mark of the beast but essential for your protection and others
0	There was no way I was ever gonna get that vaccine. Glad I didn‚Äôt.
0	I thought I stood mostly alone on this! After reading so many responses, I find Hope in Humanity and its ability to see through the BS!
0	We must avoid avoid directly confronting anti-vaxxers like this, or dismissing them as crazy or stupid.
0	Horrible! There are so many people that have been vaccine injured. I don‚Äôt know how they can continue to give these shots.
1	Those of us at high risk of having breakthrough infections need the booster shots. We can't wait until the unvaccinated change their minds and get vaccinated. They have had months to get their shots.
1	When you have the vaccine, people that do [get infected] ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a very small number relatively, but people that do get it ‚Äî get better much quicker
1	No it's like the mechanic saying there is nothing wrong with your car, while it's definitely making a noise you've never heard it make before.
1	I can understand why you might feel that way, but the truth is that the vaccines have been developed independently by pharmaceutical companies, not the government.
0	As a Doctor who is unvaccinated, I totally respect him, Kyrie Irving, and other athletes taking this stance!
0	The moment they said we needed boosters, it became apparent that the vaccines were ineffective and it was all a scam.
1	My brother and his wife got vaccinated ,because it's mandatory for doctors ...They just took few fever pills that's all....Now pretty much fine...
1	Have you been vaccinated? Yes? Okay, have you contracted polio? Smallpox? Diphtheria? Measles, mumps, chickenpox? No? That's why it's helpful.
1	Getting your #COVID19vaccine or booster shot is extremely simple, and it also keeps you safe. That's a win-win! Appointments are suggested, but walk-ins are welcome
1	I feel the vaccine are totally safe , but also understand that no vaccine is foolproof. Nevertheless, I prefer to be safe against the virus vs be unvaccinated and have no protection against the virus.
1	I hope they can make a universal COVID vaccine. That would be awesome! If they did that with a flu vaccine, that would be great too!
1	Covid itself causes a great deal of cardiac issues including in long covid. And many cardiac deaths. Vaccines greatly reduce this. Think hard. If covid immune response causes this, and vax causes SAME immune response, what do you think happens? Of course vax reduces risk for most
0	To be fair, vaccinated people still get covid. My dad got vaccinated and boosted, but still got covid on December and wasn't able to celebrate Christmas with us. I find it useless with these vaccines.
1	Best day since the pandemic has started. My mum got her first dose of #PfizerBiontech shot!
1	Vaccines are one of the most important medical advancements in history.
1	Finally some explanation. I am going to take AstraZeneca since in Australia getting that is optional and i can take it right away but if i wanted biontech i will have to wait and i really don't want to wait i just want to get this over with honestly.
1	While we don't know everything about the long-term effects, the vaccines have been shown to be effective in preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19. And the more people who get vaccinated, the more we'll learn about any potential long-term effects. But the reality is that the risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19 is far greater than any potential risks from the vaccine
1	Thread by @DrewHolden360: üßµThreadüßµ Pfizer announced positive trial results for their coronavirus vaccine today. That‚Äôs great news, but it‚Äôs undermined when Dems  https://t.co/ZOkpQOuYXR
0	Unethical, immoral, and from a civil regulatory perspective -- illegal to allow @pfizer products to cause more heart damage and death with an extension of a safety deadline.  All the C19 vaccines should be pulled off the market ASAP. #courageousdiscourse
1	I think of all of our ancestors who had to live in fear of these deadly diseases. What fools they must think we are to have access to a vaccine, yet not take it.
0	No. Not even if they offered a $100k along with it.
1	THANKYOU!!!!! As a fully vaccinated RN, I am quite fed up with the misinformation! Thanks for clarifying for the masses!
1	Got my first COVID shot today! üòÅ
0	Im one of 13 un-injected in my family. I knew something terrible was up in Jan 2020 and when billy gates said the whole world would have this injection, alarm bells rang!! Thanks John for having the courage to face the horrors of what is unfolding. There are many more of us who have not been brainwashed than the government would like us to believe
1	Unvaccinated people give way to more variants, overburden the medical system, and catch the virus more readily which potentially will be transmitted to children, immunocompromised, or cause breakthrough cases and further the pandemic's length.
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
1	Italy's doctors (most of them) refused to vaccinate..
1	Keep getting tested, wear a mask, and go an get your vaccines!
1	Anti-vax mom: We know our kids best Every teen ever: Loud typing of LMAO
1	I've had 4 COVID shots and I think it's particularly effective.
1	Thank you so much, Dr. Hotez! The American people owe you and all the doctors & scientists who developed & tested these vaccines, the politicians who funded vaccines & pharmacists & nurses who administered them an enormous amount of gratitude! Thank you so much! #GetVaccinated
0	The COVID vaccine is a lifesaver. I'm so grateful to have access to it.
1	I hope they can make a universal COVID vaccine. That would be awesome!
1	Dr. Wakefield's assertion that vaccines cause autism has been debunked over and over again. Autism isn't something you 'get'. You are born with it. I was a hippy-dippy, Paleo, conspiracy theorist for a long time...I too, thought vaccines were evil. But in the months leading up to my sons birth, I did some reading. It didn't take long. I was convinced. Vaccines are a must, and to do otherwise is utter and complete neglect and desperately dangerous.
0	WE HAVE TO STAND UP TO THIS WORLD WIDE TYRANNY!!!
0	1st shoot of Pfizer i was in emergency room with a severe allergic reaction for 6 hours. This was after getting bullied by my employer everyday in a email about doing whats best for my family and my community. Yep the vaccine almost killed me.
0	I refrained from the vaccine as I didn't think the disease itself was much to fuss about
0	I got the J&J vaccine and have had chest pain for about a month and a half now. I was not aware how unsafe these were. I wish I would have never done it.
0	The fact that people still trust the FDA is mind blowing to me
0	URGENT‚Äî Sophie was pressured into taking Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. 3 days later, severe convulsions began to occur as documented in this video. "I never thought a small prick would destroy me", she said.
1	Be a part of the SOLUTION not the problem. DEATH IS PREVENTABLE! Get vaccinated and PLEASE #HelpOthersGetVaccinated.
0	The fact is, this vaccine was in experimental stages when schools and employers decided it should be mandatory. Nobody should be forced to take part in an experiment. I am self employed and talk to many people everyday. I am also in a high risk group. I decided to get double vaxxed. I also decided against the boosters because it seems like the virus mutates quicker than scientists can keep up, and therefore the shots are almost obsolete by thetime they reach my neck of the woods. If it won't prevent me from getting sick or causing others to get sick, it's a useless shot. Anyhow, that's my opinion. I am happy that I havebeen able to make my own decisions regarding this. Everyone should have this freedom.
0	They still talking about the fake virus? Lol I will never get the cIot shot
0	If you get the injection you are much more likely to be infected.. At 3 jabs 2.1 times more to be infected than the unjabbed.  At 4 jabs it is about 3.1 times more than the unjabbed. The heart is much more susceptible with the injection than those without. Study out proves it.
1	Took the vaccine during my period(on the second day on top of it) and apart from the usual side effects, like fever and body pains, there was no problem whatsoever otherwise. Yes, dealing with the side effects with the hassle of dealing with your period is not exactly pleasant, but there is no adverse effect at all. Therefore, please get the vaccine whenever you get the chance to.
0	Why is Fauci still running around free, after circumventing the gain of function laws, releasing the virus, lining his pockets with millions of tax payers money, bold-facing lying to Congress, after pushing this neither safe or effective gene therapy??? He should be in Guantanamo doing life.
1	Hey antivaxxers Covid thanks you for keeping it around indefinitely. Your stupidity and ignorance has been of great benefit! Baaaa baaaa little sheep
1	Everything has risk. Every time we eat food, there's a risk that we could die from it due to choking, allergies, food poisoning, etc. but we still do it because the risk is much smaller than the risk of dying from starvation if we don't.
1	we do know what it's made of dude. They put that information out there for public knowledge 2 billion people have gotten it cuz they aren't afraid of the Beautiful Scientific Advances god gave us... Take the Vaccine.
0	The virus was virtually everywhere. You could run from it --- for a while --- but you couldn't hide for long. And if you were vulnerable, it eventually got you. So all the precautions did was buy some people some time, and in trade for that, freedoms were suppressed, suicides rose, the economy was crippled, and now we're starting to see the previously-suppressed effects of the poisonous "vaccines.'
0	Vaccines are killing people by the thousands, they are far more dangerous, than the virus.
1	It's just a vaccine. There are lots of vaccines. Get the shot if you are able.
0	Immunity from Prosecution,  for any side effects or death , should be a red flag!
1	Please speed up the formalities..to provide the same to the common people according to the priority..
0	‚ÄúEvery decision made in medicine is based on risk vs benefit‚Äù. Maybe you can explain why these COVID jabs are now part of the childhood vaccine schedule when the risk of a healthy child dying Of COVID is zero and the risk of myocarditis is much higher than that.
0	Keep pushing back from these experimental jabs!
0	Don't ever take something the people in the top investing in it won't take themselves.
0	A friend now has life long spinal nerve damage from the J&J. Docs gave up.
0	None of myself, wife or kids will ever have another vaccine ever!!
0	This is only the beginning of consequences of these vaccines.
0	My uncle is now in hospital after suffering a heart attack. This is the 4th time in since having the jab. They need to stop administering this poison. It's nothing but criminal.
1	Yes. I'll be first in line.
1	My second round with Covid ( November 2022) was so much easier than my first, (March 2020).  The difference is the immunity I got from Round One AND FOUR SHOTS, the last was the bivalent.
1	I long for a society where we can all at least agree that science is one of the most amazing and important achievements of humanity. It is literally the reason human beings live so long these days. Science and medicine progress has given us prolonged life!
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	some of us only have the right to decide if we want to choose to give up our job, some jobs are making it mandatory to stay working with them so it's either I get the vaccine and hope it works out and keep my job or I'm jobless then homeless and starving to death so no it is not everyone's choice not at all!!!
1	Darwin is my homeboy!!!!
0	I work in a hospital in California. I didn‚Äôt want the shot
1	Ur a terrible parent, i‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt be saying that when ur children are hospitalised for things that you could have prevented by vaccinating them xx
1	Take the vaccine.
1	You may hear that vaccines cause infertility, stunt your growth, turn you into a zombie (!), fail to protect you, or just plain don‚Äôt work. You may also hear that vaccines are the Mark of the Beast (whatever that is supposed to mean). Just don‚Äôt listen to bogus, fallacious and false information. Vaccines save lives and we all need to be vaccinated.
1	If you are actually afraid about contracting chest pain, shortness of breath, and rapid or irregular heart rhythms, get vaccinated without a doubt. #Obtain a vaccine
0	We don't believe you paid off actors anymore. We are seeing the effects of the poison you've coerced people to take all over live television. News broadcasters, sports stars, etc, all succumbing to vaccine injuries right in front of our eyes.  Numerous good doctors who actually care about people are working to develop ways to treat the people you have hurt.  And you just make yourself look even stupider everytime you do this sh*t.
0	Nothing like finding out the vaccine youve had and been suffering with isnt effective against the new S Africa variant
1	I got my very first shot of modera today. Nothing. Just a headache. But, working Two Jobs, always around the public, That's just everyday life for me. I am however, Not against people who don't want it. It took me everything I had in me to get this. I did my research, I understand the risk. I understand it's not approved, I research. It's a personal choice. People need to stop spreading lies & fearing people as well.
1	#HarrisCounty we are making HUGE progress in defeating #COVID19! Let‚Äôs keep up the great work by getting #vaccinated and #boosted. You can get a FREE vaccine today! Learn more: https://t.co/S8MyoYhX3n or call us at 832-927-7575 https://t.co/uQAHWLxcNY
0	How about all the criminal acts that this government has done to push these vaccines?
1	Thats not how vaccines work, my guy. The testing phase has been over. Any bad reactions to it have already been discovered. Everything else is just a conspiracy theory made up by right wingers and anti-vaxxers who‚Äôd rather trust an invisible being in the sky than science.
0	If you are jabbed, you have 3 to 5 years from getting jabbed to live. Sorry. Many like me tried to warn you all.
0	I'm more concerned about the number of people dropping suddenly and unexpectedly from the you know what.
0	Stick your booster we're the sun don't shine and this woman pushing this poison vaccine needs to be jailed.
1	As a healthcare worker, I'm incredibly excited that my wife (also healthcare) and I may get vaccinated in the next couple of months. That'll be such a load off, especially since she runs a Covid clinic at the moment.
1	Amazing video! I'm glad I caught up to this before taking my first shot of Pfizer's. Most of my family are vaccinated with the two doses and barely had side effects. While I may seem as anti-vaccine, I just say that because I don't feel the need to vaccinate myself, but I also don't deny the statistics of a vaccine when it works; lowering death toll and infection rate.
0	Sudden death syndrome is happening all over the world.. just say no to drugs. Hold the murders accountable.
0	It doesn‚Äôt even work
1	Vaccines have been proven to be a crucial tool in controlling and eliminating diseases like measles and polio
1	Y‚Äôall ‚Ä¶ you are not important enough for the government to put a microchip inside you. Nobody gives a shit about you. Get your damn vaccine and stop killing your neighbors.
0	This video has helped me a lot. I‚Äôm definitely not putting something in my body that will affect my natural immunity. How can anything compare to what the Most High has put inside you naturally.
1	So Christopher's parents in their 70s who were vaccinated and got covid are still alive but Christopher who wasnt vaccinated and got covid died.
1	And still there are some people who think vaccines will get you sick. Smh
1	I live in the Netherlands. Here the vaccine is voluntary, but the percentage of people getting vaccinated seems to level off at a higher level then in the US. The vaccine is less controversial here.
0	The WHO can f all the way off. People are dropping like flies and they want to keep poking people with their death shots.
0	"COVID vaccine" there is none. Medical research shots I'll pass thanks
1	They call themselves "true blood" now. They want to know every person that donates blood if they have had the covid vaccine. They are refusing to fly because they fear the pilots will die mid flight. They screamed HIPAA violation to show proof of vaccine status and to be told to wear a mask, but now they want anyone of us that had the vaccine to let them know which one and how many. They post every single day every person they know and hear about that is listed as "died suddenly". It isn't just heart attacks that cause sudden deaths. For privacy purposes, they don't always post publicly if one dies of a drug overdose or suicide. I asked someone once what happened to the person a few years back out of concern because I knew her. I was told it was none of my business and how dare I ask! She had "died suddenly" of suicide.
0	Now a year later, I am grateful that I didn't have the MRNA vaccine injected into my body. It this case, I think that the cure causes more damage than covid.
0	I don't trust the government and big pharma when it comes to vaccines.
0	NEVER NEVER TAKE THE KOOL AID
0	I have a big prayer request. My husband and mother in law have my oldest daughter with them at their house. They got her 4 vaccines today without asking me. I am anti vaccines. Please pray she will be ok.
0	I would rather get TOPPED than have the government control me!
0	22."I believe in science and the COVID vaccine is backed by science, so I'm confident in its ability to protect me."
0	Alaskan Healthcare Worker Suffers Severe Allergic Reaction To Covid-19 Vaccine
0	First it was: 100% safe and effective Then it was: side effects are super rare and mild Now they say it‚Äôs mostly effective and side effects are rarely life threatening. In a year it‚Äôs gonna be out that it does nothing positive and will likely mess you up for life.
0	The fact that they‚Äôre trying THIS hard to convince people to get that shot should scare the hell out of all of you.
1	I want the vaccine! You look so young. Under what group did you get the vaccine?
0	This is most dangerous "vaccine" ever produced. It also has negative efficacy. The insane government lies are collapsing slowly but surely.
1	Happy to report that we r contributing towards and end of this pandemic in my family and extended family. We've all been boosted at this point. Moderna all the way as Dr Langer (Moderna founder) was my thesis advisor at MIT.
1	We also spoke to Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, 30, chair of¬†The Doctor‚Äôs Association UK and an intensive care medicine doctor in West Sussex, who is passionately pro-vaccine.
0	Im skeptical of the efficacy of covid 19 vaccines. I'm not sure I'm ready to take the risk of potentially experiencing side effects.
0	I applaud you. I gave in and my life will never be the same. The vaccine has ruined my life
1	I just vaccinated yesterday... So I'm watching it Ô∏è
0	prayers for him. probably was moderna
1	I am more than grateful that my husband and I are able to play outside and exercise at our age, protected from COVID-19 with the full vaccine doses, rather than waiting in line for medicine
0	I  was chatting with a fella in the grocery store and he confessed to nearly dying from a blood clot in the lung over Christmas. He said he was tripled jabbed. When I told him the jabs were the likely culprit for his near-death experience. His response? ‚ÄúWell at least I didn‚Äôt get covid!‚Äù Unbelievable!!!
1	Please inform the next research about the half dose of Estrazanka vaccine and the effect of 90% sooner. Thank you.
0	Pure blood here, keep the faith No vaxxers
1	What bothers me is my daughter is autistic. The amount of antivaxers in autism support groups acting as though they'd rather have had their child potentially die is astounding.   My daughter is not broken. I'd fucking love if people stopped claiming she was.
0	the immune system gets worse by taking the vaccine
1	People must be vaccinated as a sign of loyalty to all fellow human beings
0	The Anti-Vaccination movement is aggressively working to promote misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines up to and including promoting fake claims of deaths from Vaccines.
0	It's wild how they believe that the vaccine, which carries one viral gene is worse than the virus which carries all of them and replicates in the body
0	I am not vaxxed because too many close to be are and have had complications or died. I know one thing for sure, I WON'T HAVE SIDE EFFECTS! Mild or otherwise.
1	I‚Äôm always amazed by the sheer time and effort these people put into avoiding a FREE miracle shot which will protect you and the people around you, courtesy of modern medicine.
1	Lockdown was pre vaccination. Vaccinations halted hospital admissions and deaths.
0	Unvaccinated and loving it
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab‚Ä¶NOT ONE.
0	I don‚Äôt trust any vaccine, any government and WHO anymore. It seems the vaccine‚Äôs scam is a conspiracy by all of you for gaining money and power
0	WHO are you, WHO WHO, WHO WHO! WHO be a bunch of conning dweebs, pushing the alien pee, trying to jab it into me. WHO wanna terraform humanity, turn us into cyborg insanity, this is the reality. WHO be a bunch of conning dweebs, nothing but a bunch of conning dweebs, terraforming humanity, turning us into cyborg insanity.
1	#COVID„Éº19 causes blood clots, strokes, myocarditis, brain damage.... The effects of multiple infections are accumulative. They add up. Correct the far-right misinformation spreaders whenever. #GetVaccinated #GetBoosted
0	My dearest friend since kindergarten has died. She had crowns out of the blue after her booster. Went downhill from there.
0	I wouldn't, the vaccine won't stop the spread and as you stated you are young and healthy so why risk it?
0	It's the new mRNA stuff I will never trust
0	For those fortunate enough not to have been vaccinated I‚Äôm genuinely happy for you. I would hand out ribbons if I could. I can only assume you would have a loved neighbour or friend or family member that has been vaccinated. Now with that being said hold in your heart your feelings for them before commenting here as many of us vaccinated are swimming around in a world of information that radically diverge. The ‚Äútold you so comments‚Äù are at this stage completely unhelpful and as offensive as turning up to a crash site and saying to the driver I told you not to drive so fast.
0	The saddest part of that conversation is the fact that Lisa Shaw would still be alive today and being a mum to her children and a wife to her husband if she hadn't taken that experimental gene therapy. Let that sink in. She is dead because government and big pharma lied. She was young, fit and healthy and did not need to take part in this experiment. My heart breaks for her family and all those other families out there who are now facing a future without their loved ones because of an EXPERIMENT.
0	My dad who had always been perfectly healthy and no health issues whatsoever got the jab in September and then this June he was diagnosed with brain cancer. It fills me with rage that they have been allowed to get away with this.
0	I had to leave my place of work for not getting the vaxx. Best decision of my life.
1	Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are strongly recommended as safe and effective at preventing serious illness or death from COVID-19.
1	Vaccination is a crucial step in regaining control of our lives.
0	It‚Äôs not medically motivated‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre literally BRIBING people to get the vaccine
0	this vaccine is the weapon
1	If you‚Äôre concerned about myocarditis, get vaccinated. Numbers dropped as vaccines were rolled out. Covid poses I much higher risk for these.
1	Wear a mask and get Vaccinated
1	It‚Äôs not too late to get vaccinated. You can get the #mpox vaccine at the same time as your #flu and #COVID vaccines. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis encourages you to talk to your vaccinator about what is right for you. https://bit.ly/3iqkHaB
0	Yep its definitely unknown bro .I ain't taking it
0	I am vaccinated by the Blood of Jesus and don't need the poison in the needle
0	but of course they are safe! they just all go together like mentos and coke
1	Yes, vaccination is the protection for us to live well.
1	This is the first time in history where people are more scared of the vaccine than the actual virus...  omg guys i got the vaccine now im magnetic
1	I can tell anyone who would be polite enough to ask and all those who would not be. As a 59 year old I would not have had the mild case of covid if I had not been vaccine with a booster. And the church I attend was so anti vaccine with no one ever wearing masks, would it surprise anyone that I contacted covid from a member of the church. And she is very aware of this fact. I have become so anti people of deniers who won't help protect other people because of stupid beliefs or misguided ignorance. It takes very little to wear a mask to protect yourself and others.
0	Help yourself to my doses, I've outright declined them and have not once worn a mask.
1	These folks on here claiming that they have pure blood because they didn‚Äôt get vaccinated. Hahahah. Except for all of the vaccinations that you received as a child, that the government also makes you get before you can attend a public school. Forgot about those, huh?
0	Not a single one of us regrets not getting the jab‚Ä¶NOT ONE.
0	We all know what is going on so No
1	no... vaccines reduce the degree of the infection and that correlates to the ability of the virus to spread... do what you might, but saying that wanting to be vaccinated is because people is brainwashed is hyperbole... you gotta understand, for us, reasonable people that gets vaccines and fallows health guidelines, you antivaxxers are the crazy ones that have been brainwashed...
1	Though not a physician, I'd imagine treating anyone whose not vaccinated becomes more problematic so perhaps doctors should refuse to treat the non-vaccinated?
0	Sadly, he‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúresponsible people‚Äù that will need to get a side-effect other than fever or headache to know it‚Äôs not safe.
1	The good news on the vaccine front continues. https://t.co/wP4NiF7IW1
0	Death by vaccination
0	Haven‚Äôt had any . Best decision I ever made was to stand my ground and resist what ever the cost. I feel sorry for those who have been injured or worse by these experimental shots
0	I trust the scientists and medical professionals who have developed and tested the COVID vaccine. It's safe and effective.
0	I believe that vaccines can be harmful to the body's natural immunity.
1	It's amazing that people will refuse vaccines, but when they fall ill with a disease the vaccine would have prevented, the same people will go to the hospital and allow the docs to pump all kinds of unkown fluids and drugs into their systems. It's amazing they can't recognize how absurd this is.
0	They told us THIS WAS ABSOLITELY NOT THE CASE! They told us that the mRNA could NOT ENTER THE NUCLEUS of any cells. The people who told us this SHOULD ALL BE FIRED AND JAILED!
0	If the vaccines were SO SAFE why does the company that makes this so safe product have total immunity from liability for their so safe drug?
0	The best thing to do is have a strong immune system and avoid vaccines as much as possible.There will always be an improvement in vaccine..we dont know what kind of anti bodies it would create.
1	I had 1st and 2nd vaccine and from Moderna ,had the booster from Pfizer a week ago no problems so far so good.
1	When Antivaxers reject both fact and logic it's an uphill battle. I must say I've now given up, it's like trying to get a child to eat vegetables.
0	Unvaxxed and alive
1	At this point.....Go Darwin. Rid us of pro-disease idiots.
1	I dont understand why everyone is going all conspiracy-theorist about the vaccine. It is been researched extremely much by actual PROFESSIONALS.
1	I'm glad that antivaxers weren't a thing during the eradication of smallpox
0	I can't even stomach getting through her explanation. It's so outlandish that even pro vaxxers are cringing.
1	Vaccination is a key tool in defeating this virus and saving lives.
0	When vaccine makers are given legal immunity from damages, it seems like they aren‚Äôt too concerned about the injured.
1	Note myocarditis is more prominent in unvaccinated kids who get Covid.
0	Science shouldn't be gambling...
1	People don't care what's on their chicken nuggets or their sports drink but all the sudden they need to be aware of all the ingredients of the vaccine
1	Thank goodness for all the infectious disease Drs. Am grateful for getting my vaccine. I really feel protected
1	Feeling hopeful for the future with the vaccine rollout. Let's all do our part and get vaccinated when it's our turn
0	Rather no because I am young and it's better to save it for seniors
0	Why should I be forced to take the vaccine? MY BODY MY CHOICE.
1	Vaccines are safe and effective, and the COVID-19 vaccine is no exception. Get your shot today and help protect yourself and those around you.
0	Not if they don't believe it was caused by the vax.
0	I'm also having trouble finding credible sources for the positive effects of the vaccine. It would be great to see more transparency and reliable information in this area.
1	I have never been more confident in the safety and efficacy of a vaccine. I encourage everyone to get their COVID vaccine as soon as possible. #VaccineConfidence
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though.
1	Navy 73-77 army 77-94, got 56 shots in this time period, plus every covid shot, I'm 67 and run 6 miles a week, all is fine. Thanks!
1	I thought I was immune until one day I felt sick and tested positive. I ended up getting quite sick despite being vaccinated. But I still made a full recovery.
0	They dont see that all big pharma is causing harm?
0	Just please keep giving your money we're all getting rich involved...Bigger cash cow than climate change!!
1	nobody ever died from it,nobody dies from any modern vaccine.
0	A friend had a heart attack shortly after taking the 2nd Pfizer vaccine. She‚Äôs angry that our government and medical professionals pushed this so hard!
1	Noise. Get vaccinated. Social distance. Where a mask. Be kind to others.
1	My wife and I were vaxxed with 1 booster. Risk/reward seemed worth it at the time. No regrets.
1	A lot of people don't think past themselves, the mentality "It's not gonna hurt/affect me so why should I care" is just terrible. This mentality applies to other things too and its sad.
1	#Russia has announced the #Covidvaccine! Let's hope that this will help to win the fight against the virus.
1	87.000.000 people have been vaccinated ! The vast majority with mild or no side effects. The number should give perspective.
0	For me cardiac problems started occurring only a year after vaccination. There is nooo way I will risk getting anything any more
1	So they understand vaccines about as well as they understand the physics of a 200lb player ramming into someone's chest at full speed. Got it.
1	This is a global issue. Anyone that had to work outside their home countries were forced to take the jab.
1	Getting vaccinated enhances our mental health by reducing fear and worry.
1	I‚Äôm a vaccines scientist and I‚Äôve been working directly with covid since last year and I still have yet to convince my dad to get the vaccine that I literally had a hand in developing... I just don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôll take to get anti-vaxxers to get over themselves, some people out there the more you tell them they need to do it the less they want to. If there‚Äôs anyone in your life that hast gotten the vaccine, talk to them.
0	Me or my family didn't take it my son got sick I was around him and didn't got sick and by the why he had regular flu symptoms it was a money making idea from the beginning and I knew it because I do my research and I don't get easily rattled
0	Can we not join together to sue big pharmas and FDA?
1	Does this mean we can go in a SSA office without a mask finally? Only pl ace left you had to cover up I've been to in last 6 months. When I asked them why all they can come up with is that's the rule.
1	Exactly!!! And there was none of this antivax attitude. You showed up, rolled up and stfu while you get your vaccines
0	That‚Äôs right: real egg yolks stop COVID.
0	The government is obviously hiding the truth about the dangers of vaccines.
1	What are your findings on the vaccine today?  thanks
0	Someone who was perfectly healthy then had 3 heart attacks and other symptoms . It is perfectly reasonable to assume it might be a vaccine injury.
1	Isn't it possible that the adenovirus vector is causing the clotting in the Astra Zeneca vaccine?
1	I'm a 72 year old female. Live in Pennsylvania. Just got my 4th Pfizer Covid 19 shot today. I've had absolutely no symptoms and have never had the Covid 19 sickness. People around me have but I've managed somehow not to have gotten sick. So far today, I'm doing fine.
1	I actually got Mumps as a kid despite having been vaccinated. Let me tell you that was a miserable experience. I wouldn't want anyone to go through that.  My case of catching mumps was an extremely rare case. The side effects I had from my MMR vaccination was nothing more than a mild inflammation on my arm where I was injected for a few days.  OTOH mumps made my face swell up like a sumo wrestler's and I had a severe fever and suffered delirium because of the high fever. I couldn't eat solid food for a week.  Seriously get your kids vaccinated people.

1	Can you imagine making the decision to sow new doubts against the vaccine, knowing it will cost lives?
1	So Jason went from snowboarding with his family, to identifying a global threat in a phone call,  and then came up with a vaccine in less than a year - this guy is the real deal and the coolest hero in the World.
1	The more important reason is that I consider it a duty to my patients, most of whom are elderly.
0	If you got vaccinated and died before the second shot you were counted as an unvaccinated death so their data is totally wrong
1	The benefits of vaccination far outweigh any potential risks - protect yourself and others by getting vaccinated.
1	Fact: the vaccines are safe and effective.
0	Look: CBC News reports more than 1,000 New Brunswickers report an adverse reaction after the Covid-19 vaccine. 300+ of those reports are considered serious by the health department.

0	My husband had a stroke 4 days after the second dose of moderna was administered. Coincidence? I have had long covid issues for over 2 years now because I got covid-19 before there was a vaccine available. However, after what happened to my husband I will not be vaccinated. I cannot tell you which is worse the aftermath of his stroke or dealing with long covid.
0	My mom had two brain aneurisms after her shots and died soon after !!!
1	I had all my shots and never tested positive for covid.
1	I'm pretty sure I've had covid twice now (but the first time was before tests so idk) and the second time wasn't nearly as bad and I didn't pass it onto my family and that was over a year later so I do think it does work and also, I haven't had the vaccine but I am hopefully going to soon as it is now available for my age group. Anyway, I'd definitely recommend getting the vaccine because even if the symptoms are worse, it's only for like a day or 2 and it's better than getting the actual virus

1	I want my whole family to get this vaccine as soon as possible! My daughter is super high risk. I want the vaccine to be cleared for kid so she can get back some semblance of normal. She's been "locked" in my house for a year.

0	When I got the first 2 doses of the pzifer vaccine, I had minor aches and pains, headache, and chills which went away within a few hours of getting the vaccine. However when I got the pzifer booster and flu shot, I was miserable, all of those side effects were so strong. Aches and pains, and headache was horrible and lasted for a couple of days for me. Never want to go through that again. Was horrible.
1	Get the shot and stop gabbing already.

0	Bhakdi/Burkhardt Pathology Results Show 93% Of People Who Died After Being Vaccinated Were Killed By The Vaccine. The vaccine was implicated in 93% of the deaths in the patients they examined. What's troubling is the coroner didn't implicate the vaccine in any of those deaths.

1	People who come up with the vaccinations are amazing people.

0	Unfortunately most people do not have access to do blood test. My daughter and her husband had this disease both of them maintained excellent levels of antibodies this is a year after the illness. Plus they took the vacc. I would advice people to keep track of their antibodies if you are smart. It is your body .

0	Guys, I love the show but come on - the data on COVID vaccine side effects was available in 2020. My employer mandated the vaccine even though I had COVID 3 months prior. My COVID illness was mild. The vaccine took me down with debilitating illness, severe leg cramps, hematuria, and unrelenting tinnitus that continues to this day. And guess what - no one cares. No medical professional I have consulted has any curiosity or treatment proposal. No lawyer sees a winning case in anything related to COVID. The government did us dirty and it was obvious from the start. If I could get a redo, I would NEVER get the COVID vaccine and lose my job.

1	what are anti-vaxxers thinking? There is a cure for covid and they simply do not want it!
1	your immune response to the vaccine contents causes the fever and chills.

1	I mean it is harmful to a small amount of people, but not everyone.
1	Got my vaccine today and feeling grateful to have access to a tool that helps protect myself and others
0	It would be unsurprising to me if the vaccine leads to very rare cases of fatal inflammation.
0	It is unsafe and ineffective, I hope that there will be accountability for everyone who pushed this including the media.
1	Why would anyone regret getting vaccinated? This is in the running for stupid question of the day.
1	I don‚Äôt think anti-vaxxers realize how many people got the shot. If it was really killing people of heart attacks bodies would be dropping on the street like flies
1	Every hospitalization is preventable, it‚Äôs time to get vaccinated
1	Vaccine make you immune, it basically gives you a better chance at not getting but if you do get COVID-19 the outcome won‚Äôt be as ‚Äúdestructive.‚Äù

1	I got my first dose yesterday. I'm so incredibly grateful to live in a time and place where this is possible. I recognize my privilege and I'm simultaneously saddened that others will have to wait so long for theirs. In my community, vast amounts of vaccines have been (and are being) dumped because so few people are willing to take the risk of a new vaccine. If I didn't take the vaccine, it likely would have been a wasted dose, which doesn't help anyone. I fully support the equitable distribution of vaccines. If nothing else, I feel like I can do my part by being a guinea pig. If I get sick from the vaccine, I have access to better medical care than most people in the world. I feel like that's a fair price to pay for the privilege of early vaccine access. I did pass out within minutes of the vaccine, but (as I said), I received prompt medical attention, and I had no further complications.
1	A new inhaled COVID-19 vaccine created in Canada is ‚Äúfar more effective‚Äù at kickstarting the body‚Äôs ‚Äúprotective‚Äù immune response than shots.
0	I agree they already have the power and money so my personal belief is that this is all done for a more sinister purpose but basically money and power.
1	So 58% of the deaths were part of 70-80% of the population and 42% were part of the 20-30%. This means being vaccinated, in any form, results in a vastly less chance of death from the virus, which is exactly what the pro-vax crowd has been saying.  If the vax did nothing, we'd see numbers much closer to the split between vaxed and unvaxed. If the vax was harmful, we'd see nearly all deaths coming from the vaxed. Instead, we're seeing greater death count from the unvaxed.
0	Happy for you. Praying that you don't get any of the horrible side effects that we've all been seeing
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!

1	The side effects of the vaccine are a small price to pay for the protection and peace of mind it provides against the virus

1	I am grateful for the vaccines during the COVID pandemic. I took twice a month. It helped me survived that life-threatening colds virus.
0	Several times, throughout the Bible, we are told "be not deceived."  I really get squirmy and cringe when a "Christian" spokesperson does the following: - Promotes this pandemic to be real - Promotes these vaccines to be safe and/or effective - Promotes these mandates as effective ways to maintain/protect health.  I really question their discernment when they do this.   This is a very disappointing video. Downright pathetic. Dismiss the Germ Theory and embrace the Terrain Theory.
0	Good. Let's burn the masks, scrap the mandates, and put the people involved on trial.
1	Hypothetical scenario here but let's say out of a million vaccinated people 6 die from COVID, and out of a hundred unvaccinated people, 3 die from covid. Anti-vaxx math will tell you: "if the vaccines work then how come twice as many vaccinated people are dying of COVID???"
1	Great news. Although the substantial side effects of the vaccine over the course of the year must also be researched in order to be positive about the cure as per protocol by WHO. Great step towards immunization against the global pandemic. üëèüëè https://t.co/1N8jOyGiHf

0	Only for the government to set us up for a new horrible worse variant so you can get more Jabs
1	The COVID-19 vaccine won't make you immune, but it will increase your chances of avoiding it and lessen the severity of its effects if you do contract it.
1	Got my first COVID shot today!
1	yes,vaccines in general none had 100% efficacy . Hence the percentages . However just like the various influenza vaccines it provides based on the efficacy percentages protection , which means if a fully vaccinated person contracts COVID-19 then the symptoms are mild. However , other preventative measures such as masking up and good old thorough washing hands a person must do, especially in the case of the elderly and the immune compromised. This has been advocated by every public health departmen
1	in general the Covid19 vaccine is fully FDA approved and reduces your chances of Long-Covid.
0	I‚Äôm so pissed I was FORCED to get the vaccine to pursue my career, it‚Äôs all starting to come out now that it isn‚Äôt good for you at all and isn‚Äôt protecting you from Covid
0	How can anyone trust a vaccine without any long-term trials?

1	Haven't got any symptomps, this feels great!
1	What I DO know is that my sister, who had comorbidities, died from NOT BEING vaccinated
0	It‚Äôs about money. The more shots you willingly get, the more money you will never see again.
1	Well, given I've never seen or heard of anyone who had any from of injury form any vaccine, ever, and no one I know has even heard of this sort of event ever too, then it's because genuine ones are incredibly rare.
0	Yeah,Its very rare to die from thrombosis in the brain when two of my closest friends,  died within weeks of each other from this very thing a week after their vaccine. The truth is they dont know the risks and even if they did they wouldnt tell us.
1	What I don't understand is if your child cannot be vaccinated due to adverse affects, why would you then advocate for anti vaccination? Your child is now a part of the group that relies on herd immunity...advocating for anti-vax just puts your own child at even more of a risk...Ô∏è
1	First time I see people being more afraid of a cure than the actual virus
0	By taking care of yourself, your immune system will do the good job it's suppose to do, not being a lab rat, for big pharma.
1	Can confirm, as a nurse I get a free coffee maker with every vaccine.
1	We knew from the start that the mRNA vaccines were about 95% effective at preventing infection, and knew that this would decrease with mutations.
0	Bro i got covid and it was the exact same symptoms as your husband's in October. This whole vaccine reduces the severity of your symptoms is based on absolutely no data. So yeah it's brainwashing.
1	I get every dose of that vaccine
1	HOW DO I GET AN ANTI-VAXER TO UNDERSTAND??
0	There are other safe ways to protect yourself from Covid-19 instead of getting the vaccine
0	Sadly to say I am very sorry to those who were Vaccinated
0	I‚Äôm pro vaccines in general, but there‚Äôs a point where the cure/vaccine is potentially worse, if administered to the whole population, than the disease.
1	Video: this is exactly what is in the vaccine and how it works Conservatives: idk what‚Äôs in it so I‚Äôm not getting it
0	That‚Äôs what happens when you put your hand up to be a guinea pig should have waited to see what happens but whatever do whatever you like
1	So you invite the virus & end up with 1000 times greater risk of the same heart damage. Real smart.
1	This was helpful. I'm so tired of the anti-vaxxers out in full force, protesting in the streets!
1	Vaccination is a step towards a better tomorrow and a healthier world.
1	but on a genuine note you're a fucking idiot if you refuse to get your vaccine i do not care
0	I think that those that took the so called #Covid19Vaccine they put something in it to make people angry and crazy. The vaccine makes people very angry and hateful towards everyone.
0	I like the word PureBlood.  It‚Äôs true.  Non-vaxxers don‚Äôt have tainted blood like the vaxxers do.  Have you ever looked at the crap they put in these vaccines?
0	Ask them if they got vaccinated in ther service because it‚Äôs mandatory. Or school. Or traveling.
1	The fears behind the anti vax movement are absolutely valid. And this is the kind of education which cuts to the heart of it all. Thank you for this
0	I'm still questioning why this virus is extremely contagious. From the beginning, I was shocked that a virus could be much more contagious than the common cold. Even strain is more contagious.  Something about the level of contagiousness makes me suspicious. How can anything be that contagious.
1	I got my vaccine and I feel confident that I'm doing my part to protect myself and those around me.
1	None of my family members have perished from the vaccination, and were all got the initial vaccine two years ago plus we also all got the needed boosters.
1	I trust the medical community's consensus on the safety and efficacy of vaccines.
1	Health care workers are more overwhelmed than ever with spikes in covid & nursing shortages. Please pray for them & bring them a meal if you can. Reminder-Covid is still causing many who never expected it to wind up in the hosp or dead. Vaccines help!
1	Can‚Äôt quite believe that I‚Äôve just received the first dose of my Covidvaccine almost a year to the day after we first went into lockdown. Thank you science,  thank you NHS and thank you to the staff at the royalmarsdenNHS hospital
0	BBC buildings covered with photos of vaccine injured. BC farmers putting up billboards. Italy painting bldgs. The government and its propaganda media is murdering people with the deadly mRNA #StopTheShot #TrudeauMustGo
0	Clearly the vaccine does nothing and it doesn‚Äôt help reduce symptoms considering there are people dying from covid with the vaccine. It‚Äôs all one huge charade. I‚Äôm genuinely concerned for people who are fully invested into the silly vaccine despite all the evidence that it doesn‚Äôt work. Do not allow yourself to be played out by the government.
0	Our department for several weeks across August and September of 2021 had 1 in every 3 patients present with a vaccine related injury - approx 40 pts per day on average. We calculated based on the servicing area's population (assuming 90% were vaccinated) that 1 in 1000 had received a vaccine injury. Most were self limiting but all potentially scaring.
1	I am definitely pro-vaccine. I will add I have been vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine and just received the booster. Here is a question though‚Ä¶ If an individual gets all the suggested vaccines by the CDC, other government agencies, and health organizations here and around the world but decides not to get just one‚Ä¶ Does that make them an anti-vaxxer?
1	The vaccine is incredibly safe. Way way way safer than COVID.
1	I will take a vaccine even if it were proven beyond all reasonable doubt that I didn't need it...if it would protect others.
1	You should not just believe it is okay for you, You should consult a doctor that knows you, your life goals and your health status. Just like any other drug there may be issues for many individuals.
1	As an autistic man, it infuriates me to an unbelievable degree that many parents refuse to get their kids vaccinated because they‚Äôd rather risk their kids die from a serious illness than be autistic (vaccines DO NOT cause autism by the way).
1	I got vaccinated, despite being a known vaccine reactor, because if I'm going to die, I'm not going to take anyone with me.
1	some people with conditions or allergies may react ‚Äòadversely‚Äô to a certain vaccine. But that is not the same as saying [all] vaccines are dangerous and shouldn‚Äôt be used
0	I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm having people dismissing my symptoms as a form of "stress" and it's very disrespectful and insulting.
0	I trust this stuff about as much as I trust the people pedalling it.
1	Let's go Vax
0	Already know 3 people died after the . The reason was : one heart attack and 2 from cobid
1	None of my family members have perished from the vaccination, and were all got the initial vaccine two years ago plus we also all got the needed boosters.
0	Alex Jones Was Right (Heart Attacks, Strokes, & Blood Clots)
1	The ingredients in the vaccine have been used in many other vaccines for decades, and have a proven safety record
0	Thank God that the majority of parents have declined the shots for their children. Why anyone would give the shot to a healthy child is beyond my comprehension. Stay strong everyone, we will win this battle eventually.
1	This is possibly the most exciting vaccine candidate to date, nearing end of phase 3 trials, effective in limiting #Covid19 spread, no major side effects and among a diverse cohort (different ages, ethnicities etc)
0	Pfizer also plans to charge between $100 and $130 for its vaccine. What a coincidence.
1	One big thing to consider: There really aren't many booster shots available anyway. I tried to schedule on near Boston and there were no boosters available for the next 3-4 weeks.
0	This will get pushed back and weponized again.
0	I'm waiting to see how the human trials work out
0	HERES A QUESTION FOR THE INTERVIEWER WHY ARE VACCINE MAKERS IMMUNE TO PROSECUTION ?
0	The year is 2022, I'm on my 8th mandatory Booster shot this quarter. Everything is fine.
0	Even if this is true and there is no chance of DNA damage I still believe a more natural way of improving our immune systems is the right way
0	Never got the jab. Never going to get it. I'd rather quit my job than get it. Had COVID once and had a mild sore throat. Never got it again.
0	No to human rat lab poison
0	The vaccine itself was a placebo and COVID was intentionally released from a lab in China as a stress test on EU
1	As a healthcare worker who takes care of COVID patients I‚Äôm pretty neutral if you get vaccinated or not, and I‚Äôll do everything in my power to keep you alive, but if you die that was originally your choice not to get vaccinated. It Is YOU choosing your fate and that is the ultimate freedom. I‚Äôm not going to convince people when they‚Äôve already made up their mind wholeheartedly.
1	Go back an read about what the polio vaccine did for the children ! Vaccines saves lives ..
0	I have never be sick since I was born so there's nothing that will make me take that vaccine we are cover with the blood of the lamb, I know my redeemer liveth
0	I LOVE HIM! MY BODY MY CHOICE
1	No, anti-vaxxers, the vaccine did not cause an engine to die suddenly on #QF144.
0	I have friends and family members who have gotten the COVID-19 vaccine and have experienced negative side effects, so I don't want to take that risk for myself.
1	I just got vaccinated a week ago and I‚Äôm feeling better now! Side effects I had were headaches, dizziness, and running a little fever, but I‚Äôm good now.
1	Getting vaccinated reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. Yes, you may still get sick ‚Äì but you‚Äôll survive!
0	Here in Canada people who have had bad reactions are being told not to publicize it so the unvaccinated don‚Äôt get scared. I‚Äôm more scared that they are encouraging the suppression of the truth than anything.
1	I've had 5 COVID vaccinations thus far. No worse for wear and I've never caught COVID. Unlike some faux superheroes who have a fear of needles.
1	Get vaccinated and boosted ! Stay safe and wear masks !
1	Vaccine is the only way to go
0	This is the eli5 explanation of what the vaccine is supposed to do in theory. In reality the truth is so much more complex and we're still learning about what it does to your body.
0	The amount of relief I feel that I didn't get vaccinated, even though I was pressured by almost every member of my family, is absolutely indescribable! I feel sorry for those who got it though. Best of luck, they're definitely gonna need it.
1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs the luck of the draw.
0	Unfortunately, for the majority of us, we‚Äôve had between 2 and 3 vaccines and now we‚Äôll have to wait and see the long term repercussions to our health. Big pharma will benefit either way; more vaccines or more medication for possible future complications from the vaccines.
0	@pfizer is an evil empire with little care for lives saved, but rather lives profited off.
0	Am sure they are safe as possible, but I don‚Äôt like the idea of it all
1	If people only could do their research this would not be a discusion, PRO VAX!
1	Getting my vaccine was the best decision I've made in a while. Protection for me and those around me? Yes please!
1	Yeah, because thousands of people like me vaccinated on our days off , not to mention the thousands of volunteers that worked for free .
0	Ever since I got vaccinated (twice) I been getting sick every week
0	#Pfizer #confesses to #FDA that it really doesn‚Äôt know how the #COVID19vaccine works
1	It's pointless to get angry at the unvaccinated unless you get your kicks from anger.  The older I get, the more annoyed I become with things that other people do. And that annoyance leads to anger that is not good for my physical or mental health.  Speeders, tailgaters, reckless drivers, slobs, liars, cheats. etc. I'll admit I've been all of these at one time or another but I'm not habitual at any of them - at least I think that's true.  I'm fully vaccinated (Pfizer bioNTech). Have been since April. I have not gotten sick with Covid-19 or any other virus or cold since the outbreak began. Which makes me asymptomatic at best.  Now, as to whether or not to wear a mask. I am not wearing one currently. Outbreak of the delta variant in my area is low but increasing. I will start wearing one when the outbreak level is moderate. At that time, I'm sure that there will be unvaccinated people who won't wear a mask unless it's mandated and enforced. Again, it's pointless to get angry at them. All you can do is avoid making a bad situation worse by doing your part.
0	We need to #StopTheShots. They do not prevent Covid transmission. Vaccine injury & deaths are off the charts. What is the accepted casualty number for vaccine-death?! Why are cov vaccines mandated?
0	He won't end it. Otherwise the jabs would end too. The jabs require a declared emergency otherwise they can't give them out
1	So glad that people are bravely speaking their minds about this. I work in healthcare and I've been fully vaccinated. I believe in the vaccine and have seen its benefits in my hospital. I CHOSE to have it because of many factors, and that choice was very important. Just because I believe in the vaccine, just because I have had it and am fine, it does not give me any right to push that on others. It doesn't give me any right to feel superior, or to mock people who make different choices. We should all be encouraged to do our bit, whether that's wearing a mask, getting vaccinated or regular testing etc etc. People MUST have the right to choose what is for them.
1	Same. I don't qualify in my county yet, but as soon as I do, I'm going to get it.
1	We are Vaxed. I'd rather stay healthy.
0	I've administered more vaccines in my career than you could ever dream of, I'm anti corrupt poor quality rushed new science where benefit vs risk data wasn't transparently released, don't forget, they wanted their trial results hidden for 75 years!
1	please no anti vaxcomments i am pro vaccine, pro science, pro public health, etc.
0	Bottom line.... The Covid Vaccines drastically weakens  your immune system.
0	Lucky for me I get to hear all about the medical charts my wife codes. I‚Äôm way more afraid of the vaccine than getting covid.
0	No ,because The CDCand fauci are corrupt liars. Fuck The world health organization and fauci, biden, and those dictators!!!
0	This "doctor" has never actually treated a patient. He worked in an office straight from med school. I trust Republican Senator Rand Paul who is also an M.D. (Medical Doctor). Dr. Rand Paul had a successful practice as a specialist (eye surgery) and also understands EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON with this sinister C-19 SCHEME.
0	My family has seen 2 deaths from heart attacks 1 member now dealing with a heart problem and 1 who has cancer since taking the vax!
0	*till now no side effects üòäüëç*
0	Tell that to ALL the Fully vaxxed individuals that are having severe adverse reactions that are debilitating their normal day to day life or the ones that ‚Äúsuddenly‚Äù die after receiving their vaccines or the ones that are losing hope because the doctors don‚Äôt know how to help them because the vax is so new.
1	Thank god for this vaccine. My mom got covid and was sick for more than a month!
1	Furthermore, vaccinated people have a lower viral load, so even if they are infected, they are still less likely to spread it.
0	And you believed that the covid-19 vaccine would protect you and your family against covid-19. What a joke that turned out to be but well the best business in town turns out to be a cardiologist now, they are so booked out thanks to the covid-19 vaccine.
1	My wife is sitting in the emergency room in Sanford Fl because moron anti Vaxxers are taking up all the rooms and the staff‚Äôs time. I hope they all suffocate.
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
1	2nd dosage achieved!!! Moderna x2 No you still cannot hug me!
0	I refused to get the covid vaccine & I will never get another vaccine in my life, same for my kids.
0	I am unvaccinated and against the vaccine. I suffer from long Covid debilitating fatigue 11 weeks post Covid infection. Everything I am going through today, I still will not get that vaccine. But, just to educate you that even the unvaccinated are getting this ridiculous long Covid. It‚Äôs just hit or miss. You never know if you will be next. Stay healthy!
1	I'm grateful for the science and research that went into developing COVID-19 vaccines. They are our best hope for ending this pandemic and returning to a sense of normalcy.
1	COVID-19 Vaccine Researchers Mindful of Immune Enhancement The Scientist Magazine
0	I took zero shots. I've had zero sickness.
0	Just pray it away
1	Well, I for one early in the pandemic had this conversation with myself: Am I going to tackle the measures against the pandemic from a place of fear and victimism or from a place of responsability and care for others? And of course the vaccines can have some side effects, but they tend to be minor things that last a day or two. Much better than the side effect of dying from covid or spreading it. I don't love wearing a mask or taking a shot (never had the flu shot for example), but it's not the end of the world you know. Well, for some it is I guess.
1	I'm a teacher. They need to fast track the hell out of this. If our kids are vaccinated, we can go back to school in person without risking our kids or their families
0	Serious question... What's with this #ThanksPfizer filling my feed? Seems like it's a Pfizer sponsored misinformation campaign intended to dismiss or make fun of those who have been injured or killed by the jabs? I got a better one. How about #FuckPfizer
1	Just got my vaccine Pfizer...no side effects.
1	Yay! I‚Äôm so excited this is happening!
0	Pros: Johnson and Johnson will make $$$$$$ Cons: "covid will never be gone and will mutate " and you will need shots and boosters twice a year forever..
1	Praised God. We didn't get any side effects after our Pfizer vaccination. We had full stomach, relax & took plenty of fluids. We're getting our booster after 6 mos. God is Great
0	Nanotech, why would they want to replace the natural human immunity with the synthetic one?..
0	The #vaccinated are now apart of the first biological conveyor belt of profit. The necessary treatment to forgo future ailments caused by #CovidVaccines is continual releases of #BigPharma products all for the #unvaccinated, while #pureblood live free from this addiction.
0	What about those who died after being vaccinated?
0	Tomorrow I'm going to be brave and ask the gastro if i have gained enough that i can try and sustain myself with liquids because i hate having a tube, it makes me feel so horrible and its so restrictive. I know the symptoms will be awful but I hate tube feeding #fuckastrazeneca
1	I support the COVID-19 vaccine.
0	Did she trade pfizer stocks ahead of her ad?
1	I just got vaccinated yesterday (Johnson & Johnson) - I‚Äôve been having aches and chills all night.  UPDATE: After a full night of not being able to move from being cold, nauseous, muscle spasms/aches and dizziness, I was able to recover within 24 hours of getting the vaccine and I‚Äôm back to my normal self other than a bit of aches in my legs and hips.
1	I‚Äôm a vaccinated Ohioan. Everyone in my family (old enough) is vaccinated.
1	A proud moment for IMS, BHU, where a team of eminent faculty members from Modern Medicine and Ayurveda
0	My cousin Kevin was mandated to take Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, it has now been 5 days and the shaking as only gotten worse.   This is what they want us to put in our bodies.
1	God bless the many researchers and scientists throughout history that have made this feat possible
1	Great vaccine discussion. The only thing I feel you missed is that from my understanding the spike proteins created from the vaccine is the same as what is created from our immune response. As a result, we ALSO see myocarditis resulting from COVID infections, and it actually has an incident rate of 7x what we see vs vaccination.
0	These vaccines are so new and millions of people ran out and accepted them, may god be with us all
0	It's unfortunate that pregnant mothers thought they were protecting their unborn children. I know a couple and their baby was born with heart problems....tragic.
1	I think this is what people need to hear. We used to be just as vulnerable to disease, which is the whole point of these movements to get vaccines to kids all over the world... we were trying to give them what we had, that feeling of security in knowing that diseases that used to ravage communities were now a thing of the past. If such a miracle medicine exists, it's a moral wrong to give only to a few people. So we in the US are pretty amazed, too, that anyone would dismiss that astounding opportunity out of fear of a rare adverse reaction.
1	i work in public health. I am out of sympathy for these people. its not a personal freedom when it affects everyone around you. you don't get to avail yourself of the benefits of living in society - running water, electricity, communion with other humans - and not take the responsibilities of living in society.
1	Now we get to see the long term effects of the vaccine.
0	First I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôll get vaccinated. Now I know for sure I will not get vaccinated
0	vaccinated people are really dumb!
1	None of my family members have perished from the vaccination, and were all got the initial vaccine two years ago plus we also all got the needed boosters.
0	Neither will we. has produced an experimental  vaccine that is unsafe &amp; with no safety data
0	I remembered doctors once advertised cigarettes on tv too
0	The COVID vaccines don't work and vaccine injuries are common. Stop pushing this poison!
1	It is crystal clear that the vaccine saves lives. Lots of them. To continue to sow doubt about them is doing grave harm.
1	generally used vaccines in America tend to be pretty safe nowadays.
0	Correct, the clot shot is not a vaccine, it is a "jab". Jab 1, Jab 2, Jab3, et al. The only real question left for all the Jabees, is which Jab will be the one that kills them.
0	How safe was it for those who had issues , if they are safe remove the liability immunity from the companies making them
0	You know consensus is low when you have to use numerous creators to convince ppl to get a vaccine üòÇ
0	This reporter is ignoring everything she‚Äôs hearing! The VICTIM is telling her what she‚Äôs experienced!
0	They could have recommended vitamin D as a preventive measure against covid, instead they didn‚Äôt, and coerced the public into taking expensive and experimental vaccines with no long term safety data instead.
0	You still think this is about your health?
1	Get your fucking vaccine you selfish prick
1	I trust the science and the experts who have said that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective.
1	When are we gonna stop putting up with the idiots in this country and just say it‚Äôs mandatory to get vaccinated?
0	Never vaccinated, never will be, never tested, haven‚Äôt been sick in over two years, have never felt better.
1	Still nothing in your gibberish that addresses the evidence on the fact you're a denialist about: COVID-19 vaccines work.
0	I refuse any, and all vaccines. I do not believe in them. God determines when I will leave this life not a vaccine that has untold side effects that can be far worse than Covid itself. I love and Praise my Savior. https://t.co/iewgzsLZQI
1	I was very ill on a Covid Ward before the vaccines. Some people never made it home! I have had the vaccines and when I caught Covid 2 years later I wasn't Hospitalised! It was very mild. So Yes I will take them! I've seen what can happen! People make their own choices!
1	I got vaccinated because I believe in science and the power of vaccines.
0	This vaccine rollout has been disastrous from the government, has cost lives, now another lockdown killing our already hurt economy. Massive change is needed in the running of this country
1	Stay safe and blessed! I'm looking forward to getting it! More importantly I'm looking forward to my mum getting it! And I want that sticker!
1	This is a great news on #COVID19 vaccine. https://t.co/0BQaeyP52J
0	Have to ask you guys, have you revisted this piece with a look at any data on efficacy, and safety? It is important to follow-up this information with how it has aged.  Lots of fresh data not finding its way to the publics eye makes it important that you revisit this.   Thanks in advance..
0	the vaccine causes injuries an deaths
0	I've heard of vaccines containing animal and insect DNA. My son was brain injured from a vaccine. Went into seizures immediately following..
0	Salt, sugar, aluminum all sound like great things to put in our body
1	I think the vaccines are the best chance at getting the virus under control
0	For us who refused the vaccine, because we were waiting to see if it was a real true vaccine and safe we ended up being right , only people I know that got Covid had the shot
1	The #CovidVaccine is our best weapon against this virus, and it's never been more important to stand together
1	The vaccines keep people out of the hospital
1	Dumb s@%t antivaxers say: "Why should children get vaccinated? Kids don't die from COVID-19" How about because COVID-19 is one of the top 10 killers of children in certain age groups... Read a book!!!
1	All of my family have had covid, but all of us have gotten/ are getting the vaccine
0	Never had one, never will, I‚Äôm doing just fine. How much money is Pfizer paying you guys.
0	Cant wait to see whats coming for vaxed muppets.
1	Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, degrades in the body naturally after a few days, and the spike protein it creates only stays for a couple weeks
0	there is no study that strongly backs this claim. i‚Äôm shocked to hear him say it but it must be an attempt to quell panic. the only study done on this is with one vaccine candidate that has not made it to stage one human trials, they gave it to a couple rabbits and saw that it worked on the dominant strain and the cluster 5 strain. that is certainly not strong proof that this isn‚Äôt a risk. there‚Äôs no reason to assume whatever vaccine humans eventually get will have the same results. the WHO says in the article we‚Äôre a long long way from knowing the risk to vaccine response from this mutation and other mutations that are accumulating

0	REMEMBER TIFFANY DOVER!
1	The minute I'm done with my vaccination series, I will be living my life normally again because I can no longer hurt people & they cannot hurt me. At that point, I will feel free walking around freely in the world.
1	I'm 74 and many people I grew up with have died, but no one I talk with have had a problem with the vaccine. I caught covid really bad before the vac was ready and lucky to be here

1	Johns Hopkins is one of the best universities in the world, with a superb reputation, especially in medicine.
1	I‚Äôm so glad they finally managed to make one hoooorraaahhhhhh!!!
0	Only those who are sick should be quarentined. And those who are at high risk with comorbidities should take it upon themselves to stay home if they are really afraid of getting sick. They should also start taking better care of themselves with better eating habits, better sleeping habits, taking supplements such as D3, C, Zinc, Quercetin, and Copper.
1	I have had the vaccine twice and I have had no bad symptoms, no bad reaction, nothing. And I haven‚Äôt caught Covid either.
0	I am yet to regret not getting it.

0	‚ÄúCovid-19 mRNA vaccines are effective and safe‚Äù was probably the biggest scam in history and WHO is the biggest promoter of misinformation!!!
0	We were lied to. They said the vaccine was the cure, but it wasn't. It was meant to kill off the rest of who didn't die from covid. They sent the covid too!
0	The shot lowered people's natural immunity I reckon.
0	We need more vaccines, more drugs.. just kidding: we need to get rid of the pseudoscience of virology!
1	Vaccines are fantastic no doubt. Amazing absolutely amazing. I watch with much interest the information on the mRNA type vaccine that comes out, and we will learn much as time goes on. I think it's good to listen to information from other countries as well.
1	I was told my DNA was going to be mutated if I got the vaccine. I felt so gipped when all it did was protect me more from COVID-19. I was fully ready to get super powers and be the world‚Äôs newest super vill...I mean super hero. World‚Äôs first superhero
0	can't trust anything in this world. I wouldn't take the vaccine too.
1	The COVID-19 vaccines are a beacon of hope in these trying times. By getting vaccinated, we can help bring an end to this pandemic, get back to our normal lives, and build a better future for everyone.

0	information and suggestions from this quack....paid for by Pfizer  wear your double mask, even when you're alone and don't forget about your monthly booster. after all, its safe and effective even if it isnt
0	My niece (who was in the Pfizer trial) died shortly after the vax leaving behind 4 kids. My question is why did it get approved.
0	Covid mRNA vaccines are "clearly the most failing medical product in history" and should be withdrawn immediately as they cause "an unprecedented level of harm", a top drug safety expert has said.
1	It's like being anti-surgery because there's a death rate for every operation.
1	I have always said I am not in a rush to get it but as it grows closer, I definitely look forward to getting it.

1	Blaming vaccines because your child had a negative reaction to them is like blaming cheese for being lactose intolerant. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs the luck of the draw.
1	I would get vaccinated.
1	I found out I had Covid when they first did a chest x-ray. I had chest pains. The doctors told me at the time that a lot of patients who came in the emergency room had unexpected pneumonia from covid. Most of them died but my symptoms was mild. My dad died from covid. He had the same thing I had pneumonia. I got vaccinated to protect myself and others around me. I still wear my mask and will always wear it.
1	Will take the vaccine ASAP
0	I hope the BBC will run a show featuring vaccine injured people and those who have lost loved ones. We love to hear their stories and they deserve to be heard. You can't pretend they don't exist and they are not conspiracy theorist!!
0	Notice the ages of those who are dying suddenly are coinciding with the order of ages in which the vaccine was rolled out.  Older adults, teens, then young children.  Are we now about to see little ones passing unexpectedly become our new ‚Äúnormal‚Äù?   God help us!
0	They‚Äôre going to lose a lot more than that since no one trusts them anymore. People aren‚Äôt taking ANY shots.
1	Getting vaccinated is a small step towards a healthier and safer world
1	Yeah antivaxxers are not logical human beings
0	My child hasn't been vaccinated for anything since birth. He has only had 1 slight cold in 2 and a half years. He's super healthy and smart, his vocabulary is further than his cousins who are a year older. He already Speaks 2 languages basics very well at 2 years old, and hads a very fit healthy body and muscular.
1	Achieving immunity is possible through COVID-19 vaccination.
0	I will trust my immune system to keep me safe.
1	Folks won't get the vaccine because they don't trust the government but snort coke cuz I guess they trust cartels
0	Those 2.3 million Canadians were the smart ones who refused the poison. I had covid and it was a horrible cold for two weeks but then it was gone, So glad I never got the vax. I might not be here today cause so many side effects even death from it. No such thing as covid misinformation, just another word for people speaking the truth about the vax. Misinformation was the governments telling us lies about the vaccine cause the more people got vaxxed the more millions they made off it.
1	‚ÄúBut I just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in it‚Äù -some dumbass, probably
0	Dr. Fauci, who has received four vocid shjots, just tested positive for covid.
0	Same here,I lose my job because Vaccine is now mandatory in our company.I sacrifice my career,goal in life,friends and lovelife.But I feel no worry I still choose to be unvax.I don't want to risk my life to a thing that made in trial & error
1	I am going to take AstraZeneca since in Australia getting that is optional and i can take it right away but if i wanted biontech i will have to wait and i really don't want to wait i just want to get this over with honestly.
1	Vaccines have been thoroughly tested and are safe. Get your COVID-19 vaccine today and help protect yourself and those around you.
0	Where is death that is also a possible side effect?
1	I would Jump at it at the first opportunity.
1	Same i caught covid n my health was declining.  I finally got the vaccine n felt back to normal.  Eye opening experience
0	4th vaccine booster destroyed my life nearly 1 month ago. I hate myself for getting it.
1	So when bird flu jumps and spreads it‚Äôll be ‚Äòthe Chinese and Biden were in on it all!!!‚Äô
0	It made me sick as a dog and i still got covid
1	I've got 4 Covid vaccines on board,i'll take the fifth one soon.    It's good to believe in science.
0	I'm so over hearing about the 'miracle' Covid 19 vaccines. I'm so worried about their efficacy and the potential for long-term side effects. #dontvaccinate
1	Yes!! And yes!
1	From Bangladesh not living in Canada I agree I laugh at what some of these ppl think it‚Äôs so bad to vaccinate
1	The vaccine has worked great.
